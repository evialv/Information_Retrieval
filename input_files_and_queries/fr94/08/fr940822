SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. The CAA advises that, during
routine maintenance, the locking mechanisms on the pistons of the spoiler actuators were found to be damaged. The
cause of this damage has been attributed to inadequate bleeding of the spoiler hydraulic system. In some instances,
the spoiler operation was out of sequence and may have caused damage to the locking mechanisms on the pistons of the
spoiler actuators. This condition, if not corrected, could result in uncommanded extension of the lift spoiler in
the event of loss of hydraulic pressure in the spoiler actuator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Jetstream has issued Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A27&hyph;034, dated June 9, 1994, which describes procedures
for removal of the left and right spoiler actuators, purging the hydraulic system, and installation of a previously
certified spoiler actuator. The CAA classified this alert service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent uncommanded extension of the lift spoiler.
This AD requires repetitively removing the spoiler actuators, purging the hydraulic system, and installing an actuator
that has been previously certified. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service
bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ``ADDRESSES.''
All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;124&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

vacuum generator. This amendment is prompted by reports of excessive vacuum generator overloads or blocked rotor
conditions, in which the thermal protection device and/or related aircraft circuit breakers do not interrupt the
power supply. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent a fire in the event of excessive current in the
electrical circuit due to overheating of the vacuum generator.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A340&hyph;211 and &hyph;311
series airplanes. The DGAC has advised that it has received reports of electrical overloads in the toilet system vacuum
generator or blocked rotors, in which the temperature of the vacuum generator motor increases faster than the detection
capability of the thermal protection device and/or the related aircraft circuit breaker. In each case, these devices
failed to interrupt the power supply. This condition, if not corrected, could cause the vacuum generator to overheat,
which could result in a fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Airbus has issued All Operator Telex (AOT) 38&hyph;01, dated December 15, 1993, and Service Bulletin A340&hyph;38&hyph;4013,
dated January 5, 1994, which describe procedures for replacement of two circuit breakers for the vacuum generator.
Existing circuit breakers, 6 MG and 106 MG, are replaced with faster (20 amp) circuit breakers to provide additional
protection in the event of excessive current in the electrical circuit or overheat in the vacuum generator. The DGAC
classified the AOT and service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive, 94&hyph;006&hyph;004(B)R1,
dated February 2, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent a fire in the vacuum generator. This AD requires
replacement of two circuit breakers for the vacuum generator with faster type circuit breakers which will improve
detection capability of the thermal protection device. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance
with the AOT or service bulletin described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There currently are no Model A340&hyph;211 or &hyph;311 series airplanes on the U.S. Register. All airplanes included
in the applicability of this rule currently are operated by non-U.S. operators under foreign registry; therefore,
they are not directly affected by this AD action. However, the FAA considers that this rule is necessary to ensure that
the unsafe condition is addressed in the event that any of these subject airplanes are imported and placed on the U.S.
Register in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately
7 work hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of this AD would be $385 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this AD action does not affect any airplane that is currently on the U.S. register, it has no adverse economic
impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary
and the amendment may be made effective in less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.

considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking action would be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;105&hyph;AD.''

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been

all de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes, that requires removal of the aluminum or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brass hardware in the firewall terminal block assembly and replacement with steel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hardware. This amendment is prompted by the results of an investigation, which revealed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that corroded aluminum washers in the DC firewall terminal block assembly may loosen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the electrical connections. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interruption of DC electrical power due to connections that may have loosened from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to all de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19154). That action proposed to require removal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aluminum or brass hardware in the firewall terminal block assembly and replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with steel hardware (Modification 7/2617).

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 55 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is estimated to be $9,075, or $165 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM)
(formerly Bendix) S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos, that currently requires
replacing Bendix ignition coils and rotating magnets, regardless of total time in service (TIS), with improved TCM
ignition coils, rotating magnets and marking magnetos to indicate compliance with this AD, except for the S&hyph;1200
series magnetos on which the AD requires replacing only the ignition coils as that series magneto already incorporates
rotating magnets with the improved TCM design. This amendment limits the number of magnetos requiring replacement.
This amendment is prompted by a report from the manufacturer that there is an error in the serial number listing of affected
magnetos. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent magneto failure and subsequent engine failure.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 29, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 94&hyph;01&hyph;03,
Amendment 39&hyph;8785 (59 FR 4555, February 1, 1994), to require replacing certain Bendix ignition coils and rotating
magnets, regardless of time in service (TIS), with improved serviceable Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) ignition
coils and rotating magnets at either the next 100-hour inspection, the next annual inspection, the next progressive
inspection, or the next 100 hours TIS after the effective date of the AD, whichever occurs first. For S&hyph;1200 series
magnetos, the AD requires replacing only the ignition coils as the rotating magnets on that series magneto already
incorporates the improved TCM design. Additionally, the AD requires remarking magnetos to indicate compliance
with the AD. That action was prompted by recent reports of accidents caused by failures of magnetos incorporating
older Bendix components that had not been replaced in accordance with superseded AD 73&hyph;07&hyph;04, Amendment
39&hyph;1731 (38 FR 27600, October 5, 1973). That condition, if not corrected, could result in magneto failure and
subsequent engine failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of that AD, TCM has informed the FAA that an error in the serial number listing in TCM Service Bulletin
(SB) No. 637, dated December 1992, resulted in too many affected magnetos requiring AD compliance. The AD should apply
only to certain magnetos manufactured by Bendix in Sidney, New York, and not to any Bendix magnetos built in either
Jacksonville, Florida, or Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, the S&hyph;600 series magnetos require replacement of
only the rotating magnets and not the ignition coils. Finally, the FAA received reports that there is some confusion
as to how the S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos are referenced in the TCM SB and
the AD. TCM has issued a revised SB that corrects these errors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of TCM Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) No. MSB644, dated
April 4, 1994, that describes procedures for replacing certain Bendix ignition coils and rotating magnets with improved
serviceable TCM ignition coils and rotating magnets and marking magnetos to indicate compliance with this MSB.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, this AD revises AD 94&hyph;01&hyph;03 to require replacement of certain Bendix ignition coils and rotating
magnets with improved serviceable TCM ignition coils and rotating magnets. For the S&hyph;600 series magnetos,
this AD requires replacing only the rotating magnets as there is no replacement for the ignition coils. For the S&hyph;1200
series magnetos, this AD requires replacing only the ignition coils as the rotating magnets on that series magnetos
already incorporate the improved TCM/Bendix design. Finally, this AD requires marking magnetos to indicate compliance
with this AD. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the SB described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The errors in the SB have caused an undue economic burden to those operators that were mandated to replace the specified
components of magnetos. This AD action will therefore relieve operators of unnecessary expense, and the FAA is issuing
this AD as a final rule without prior comment. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this
regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good
cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;44.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

 The FAA has received reports of some confusion as to what is meant by S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200
series magnetos as referenced in TCM Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) No. MSB644, dated April 4, 1994, and this AD.
A typical example is S6RN&hyph;25, where the S designates single type ignition unit, the 6 designates the number of
engine cylinders, the R designates right hand rotation, the N is the manufacturer designator (this did not change
when TCM purchased the Bendix magneto product line), and the number after the dash indicates the series (a &hyph;25
is a S&hyph;20 series magneto, while a &hyph;1225 is a S&hyph;1200 series magneto).

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, &hyph;300, and &hyph;400 series airplanes
was published as a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 15, 1994 (59 FR 11940). That action proposed to require various modifications of certain evacuation ramp/slides.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter requests that the proposed 24-month compliance time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of the ramp/slides be extended to 36 months so that it will coincide with affected operators' scheduled
overhauls. The commenter points out that the manufacturer of the subject ramp/slides recommends a compliance time
of 36 months. The commenter believes that safety will not be compromised if an extension is allowed. The FAA does not
concur with the commenter's request. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered
not only the degree of urgency associated with addressing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the subject unsafe condition, but the availability of required parts, the average utilization of the affected fleet,
and normal maintenance schedules for timely accomplishment of the modification. The FAA finds that the proposed
24-month compliance time represents the maximum interval of time allowable wherein the modifications can reasonably
be accomplished and an acceptable level of safety can be maintained. Further, the FAA took 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account the 36-month compliance time recommended by the manufacturer, as well as the number of days required
for the rulemaking process; in consideration of these factors, the FAA finds that 24 months after the effective date
of this final rule will fall approximately at the same time for compliance as recommended by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter requests that the proposed 24-month compliance time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification be shortened to 6 months. This commenter believes that a shorter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance time is necessary for continued safe operation of airplanes equipped with the affected ramp/slides.
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. As explained above, the FAA considered many factors, including
the safety implications, when developing an appropriate compliance time for this AD. After consideration of all
the available information, the FAA cannot conclude that a reduction of the proposed compliance time, without prior
notice and opportunity for public comment, is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reduce the compliance time of the AD would necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act)
reissuing the notice, reopening the period for public comment, considering additional comments received, and eventually
issuing a final rule; the time required for that process may be as long as four additional months. In comparing the actual
compliance date of the final rule after completing such a process to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance date of this final rule as issued, the increment in time is minimal. In light of this, and in consideration
of the amount of time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original proposal, the FAA has determined that
further delay of this final rule action is not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters request that paragraph (a) of the proposed rule be revised to require accomplishment of the modifications
specified only in paragraphs 2.C., 2.D.(2), 2.E., and 2.F. of the BFGoodrich service bulletin cited in the AD. The
commenters believe that accomplishment of paragraph 2.G. of the service bulletin should be optional, since the modifications
included in that paragraph are considered to be product improvements that are not associated with the addressed unsafe
condition. One of these commenters, BFGoodrich, states that approximately 40 percent of the slide modification
kits were shipped to operators prior to the issuance of the supplemental NPRM, and some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators may not have accomplished the modifications specified in paragraph 2.G. of the service bulletin. The commenter
expresses a concern that a requirement to accomplish that paragraph would result in additional costs and unscheduled
removal and maintenance actions for operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs with the commenters' request, and has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule to specify that accomplishment
of the product improvement modifications specified in paragraph 2.G. of the Accomplishment Instructions of the
service bulletin is not required by this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters request that the proposal be revised to cite the latest revision to the BFGoodrich service bulletin
specified in the AD and to reference Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;25&hyph;3028. The FAA concurs. Since the issuance
of the supplemental NPRM, the FAA has reviewed and approved Revision 2 of BFGoodrich Service Bulletin 7A1418&hyph;25&hyph;253,
dated April 15, 1994, which corrects certain typographical errors that appeared in Revision 1 of that service bulletin
and references the Boeing service bulletin. The Boeing service bulletin describes procedures for an alternative
method of modifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the packboard and girt. Paragraph (a) of the final rule has been revised to cite the latest revision of the service
bulletin as an additional source of service information. Further, ``NOTE 2'' has been added to paragraph (a) of the
final rule to reference Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;25&hyph;3028 as an additional source of service information
for modifying the packboard and girt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 1,100 BFGoodrich ramp/slides of the affected design installed on Boeing Model 747&hyph;100,
&hyph;200, &hyph;300, and &hyph;400 series airplanes in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 300 of these
subject ramp/slides are installed on Boeing Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, &hyph;300, and &hyph;400 series airplanes
of U.S. registry that will be affected by this AD. It will take approximately 22 work hours per ramp/slide to accomplish
the required actions, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the ramp/slide manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $363,000, or $1,210 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the FAA has been advised that 40 percent of the required modification kits have been delivered to airlines
having airplanes affected by this AD. From this information, the FAA can assume that 40 percent of the affected fleet
already have been modified in accordance with the requirements of this AD. Therefore, the future economic cost impact
of this rule on U.S. operators is expected to be 40 percent less than the ``total cost impact'' figure indicated above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes, that requires removal of the aluminum or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brass hardware in the firewall terminal block and battery shunt cable assemblies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement with steel hardware. This amendment is prompted by the results of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation, which revealed that corroded aluminum washers in the DC firewall terminal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
block and battery shunt cable assemblies may loosen the electrical connections. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent interruption of DC electrical power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to connections that may have loosened from corrosion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to all de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19152). That action proposed to require removal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aluminum or brass hardware in the firewall terminal block and battery shunt cable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies and replacement with steel hardware (Modification 8/1984). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 130 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is estimated to be $21,450, or $165 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been

History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FAA Order 7400.9A, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16,
1993, listed Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E airspace areas and reporting points. Due to the large number
and frequent revision of these descriptions, the FAA requested approval from the Office of the Federal Register to
incorporate the material by reference in Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) &sect;71.1 (14 CFR 71.1). The Director
of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by reference of FAA Order 7400.9A in &sect;71.1 effective September
16, 1993, through September 15, 1994. During the incorporation by reference period, the FAA processed all proposed
changes of the airspace listings in FAA Order 7400.9A in full text as proposed rule documents in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Likewise, all amendments of these listings were published in full text as final rules in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This rule reflects the periodic integration of these final rule amendments into a revised edition of Airspace Designations
and Reporting Points, Order 7400.9B. The Director of the Federal Register has approved the incorporation by reference
of FAA Order 7400.9B in &sect;71.1 as of September 16, 1994, through September 15, 1995. This rule also explains the
procedures FAA will use to amend the airspace designations incorporated by reference in part 71. &sect;&sect; 71.5,
71.31, 71.33, 71.41, 71.51, 71.61, 71.71, 71.79, and 71.901 are also updated to reflect the incorporation by reference
of FAA Order 7400.9B.

The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action amends part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to reflect the approval by the Director of the Federal
Register of the incorporation by reference of FAA Order 7400.9B effective September 16, 1994, through September
15, 1995. During the incorporation by reference period, the FAA will continue to process all proposed changes of the
airspace listings in FAA Order 7400.9B in full text as proposed rule documents in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Likewise, all amendments of these listings will be published in full text as final rules in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The FAA will periodically integrate all final rule amendments into a revised edition of the Order, and submit the
revised edition to the Director of the Federal Register for approval for incorporation by reference in &sect;71.1.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this action: (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866;
(2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and
(3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. This action neither
places any new restrictions or requirements on the public, nor changes the dimensions or operating requirements
of the airspace listings incorporated by reference in part 71. Consequently, notice and public procedure under 5
U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary.

providing appeal rights when a State-initiated mass change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally administered State supplementary payment level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts results in the reduction, suspension or termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a recipient's State supplementary payments, or when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal administration of State supplementary payments has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1616(a) of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary) to enter into agreements with the States under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the Secretary administers the States' supplementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments. State supplementary payments are cash benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid on a regular basis to individuals who are receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, or who, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but for their income, would be eligible to receive SSI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits. When the Social Security Administration, acting as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary's delegate, has entered into an agreement with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State for the Federal administration of these supplementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments, the State transfers the funds necessary to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these payments to us and we make these payments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients. States that make State supplementary payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but that have not elected Federal administration make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments themselves directly to recipients. If a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elects Federal administration, we charge the State an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration fee as of October 1, 1993, for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payment we make on behalf of the State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to section 13731 of the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66). A federally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered State supplementary payment is included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same payment with the Federal SSI benefit where both a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payment and a Federal SSI benefit are payable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The payment level amounts of State supplementary payments are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the States. From time to time, States may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change the payment level amounts, either by increasing them, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or by reducing them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our existing regulations provide in &sect;416.1402(b) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction, suspension, or termination of SSI benefits is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial determination. The regulations at &sect;416.2005(d) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that, generally, the regulations in effect for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSI program are applicable in the Federal administration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State supplementary payments. Therefore, any reduction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension, or termination of federally administered State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payments is also an initial determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 416.1404 provides that we will mail to the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient a written notice of our initial determination, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the right to a reconsideration before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination takes effect. Further, &sect;416.1413b provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a recipient has 60 days within which to appeal our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination that we plan to reduce, suspend, or terminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the current process under our regulations, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the reduction, suspension or termination of State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payments to be an initial determination, mail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate written notice of our initial determination and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide appeal rights to all affected recipients. We apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this process even with respect to mass changes in State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payment level amounts, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a State-initiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in the level(s) of federally administered State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payments payable to all recipients of State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payments or to categories of such recipients, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due, for example, to State legislative or executive action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many such cases in which a recipient appeals the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction, suspension, or termination of his or her State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payments due to the State-initiated mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change, he or she wishes only to dispute the propriety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fairness, or legality of that mass change, for example, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to dispute the application of that mass change to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facts of his or her case, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 not to dispute the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit computation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that this policy of providing affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients the right to appeal the State's action in reducing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment levels in these cases is not required by the Act or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by fundamental principles of procedural due process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, in the past, this policy has had a needless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative impact on us since we do not control, nor can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we alter, the State-initiated mass change. This impact was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated most recently when a large federally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered State supplementary payment State, as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a State law change, initiated an across-the-board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in its State supplementary payment levels. Over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27,000 affected individuals appealed to us the resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction, suspension, or termination of their State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payments on the basis that the State-initiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass change was unfair to them, and not because they wished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to dispute the resulting computation of their benefits. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vast majority of affected individuals requested benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation at the previously established payment levels, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pending issuance of decisions on the initial appeals, as set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth in &sect;416.1336(b). SSA provided appeal opportunities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals. It then informed them that their appeals were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denied on the basis that SSA had no authority to order the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State to repeal its law and reinstate State supplementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments to their former higher levels. Since States must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the funding for State supplementary payments, in some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases the State incurred additional program costs while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals' appeals were pending. Processing these actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
served only to exacerbate existing workload backlogs by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverting scarce workpower resources from other necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service delivery activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The courts have stated clearly that the legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiency of an agency's procedures with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients of public assistance who are experiencing such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandated change in their entitlement will be measured first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under an agency's statute and regulations. If no violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the statute or regulations is found, then it must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined if the agency's procedures violate constitutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due process requirements. In

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
472 U.S. 115 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1985), the United States Supreme Court considered whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Food Stamp Act required that an individual hearing be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided for every household affected by a general change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the law. The Court found that the Food Stamp Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguished between an adverse action based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular facts of an individual case, on the one hand, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a mass change initiated by the State or Federal Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting the entire caseload of recipients or significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions thereof, on the other hand, with Congress only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemplating hearings on individual fact-based adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our existing regulations do not relieve us from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing appeal rights to recipients for mass change actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in their State supplementary payments. Nevertheless, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that there is no requirement in the Act that we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a recipient of a federally administered State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payment an opportunity to appeal a reduction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension or termination of his or her payments resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a State-initiated mass change, if that individual does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not dispute the application of that mass change to the facts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of his or her case. Like the Food Stamp Act, only appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights with respect to individual adverse actions appear to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be contemplated under the Social Security Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to constitutional due process requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we believe that those requirements mandate that an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose benefits are reduced, suspended or terminated as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of a State-initiated mass change be afforded the full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure of appeal rights in a matter in which he or she 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disputes the application of that mass change to the facts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her particular case, that is, in a case where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient alleges that we have improperly computed his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits as a result of the mass change. In

397 U.S. 254 (1970), the United States Supreme Court

held that fundamental notions of due process of law required

that individuals who sought to challenge the termination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their public entitlements as ``resting on incorrect or

In light of the

Kelly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decisions, we do not believe that full appeal rights under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our administrative review system are required in situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where claimants are contesting only the State legislative or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
executive action which results in a change in the level(s) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the federally administered State supplementary payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, under these regulations, claimants will receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of the State-initiated mass change and be given appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights only with respect to the calculation of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual benefit amount made pursuant to the mass change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These procedures follow the rationale of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes from adverse actions based on the facts of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the factual bases or the application of rules to particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facts as is required by the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Kelly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases where the individual desires to appeal the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction, suspension or termination resulting from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-initiated mass change only to dispute the propriety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fairness, or legality, for example, of the mass change, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presents no claim that his or her benefits have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improperly calculated, then we believe that the Act and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedural due process do not require that we provide such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual the right to appeal that action. As indicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, State supplementary payment levels are established by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States. Any change in those levels as they apply across 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the caseload of State supplementary payment recipients is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the most part, a matter within the control and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction of the States. We are required to administer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States' payment levels under the Act, regulations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the Federal/State Supplementation Agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and have no right, power or authority to find State-initiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass changes in those levels to be unfair, illegal or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improper, nor can we order the States to increase those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In preparing these regulatory changes, we have noted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's regulations for the Administration for Children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Families regarding the availability of a hearing in cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of mass change in the Aid to Families With Dependent Children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Those regulations provide in 45 CFR 205.10(a)(5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ``[a] hearing need not be granted when either State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal law requires automatic grant adjustments for classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of recipients unless the reason for an individual appeal is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorrect grant computation.'' We believe that a similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach is appropriate where a mass change in the level of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally administered State supplementary payment is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of State legislative or executive action.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, because of the futility of affording individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by a State-initiated mass change the opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal the effects of that mass change in cases involving no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disputed facts but only a claim, for example, regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propriety or legality of the mass change itself, we believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is appropriate for us to amend our regulations so as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to limit the opportunity to appeal, and the corresponding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to continue to receive benefits pending a decision on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the initial appeal, as set forth in &sect;416.1336(b), only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those cases involving disputed facts. We, therefore, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising our regulations at &sect;416.1401 to define a ``mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change'' as a State initiated change in the level(s) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally administered State supplementary payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to all recipients of such payments, or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories of such recipients, due, for example, to State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislative or executive action. In addition, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising our regulations at &sect;416.1402 by adding a paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) to state that only our calculation of the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in an individual's State supplementary payment amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which results from a mass change is an initial determination, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to administrative and judicial review, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation of benefits pursuant to &sect;416.1336(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also are revising our regulations at &sect;416.1403(a) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that a determination to reduce, suspend, or terminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally administered State supplementary payments due to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-initiated mass change in the level of such payments is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not an initial determination, except as is provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;416.1402(n), i.e., only our calculation of the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change in the State supplementary payment is an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. In addition, we are revising &sect;416.1403(a) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify that the termination of Federal administration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State supplementary payments is not an initial determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The termination of Federal administration of these payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means only that the State has assumed the responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the issuance of its supplementary payments. The amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State supplementary payments an individual receives will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change because of the termination of Federal administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only change will be that the State will be making the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments. There will be no adverse impact to the recipients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely due to the change. Further, we are revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;416.1403(b) to explain that we will provide to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients a notice of the termination of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration, although the determination will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to administrative or judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Early in the SSI program, which became effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1974, several States terminated Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of their State supplementary payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there have been no recent terminations, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising &sect;416.1403 to clearly state our policy on the effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of terminations.

Comments on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 10, 1993, we published proposed rules in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 58 FR 42514 with a 60-day comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We received 3 letters with comments. Following are summaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of those comments and our responses to them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claimants should not be denied the right to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge a reduction in State supplementary payments below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally mandated levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal law does not mandate State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payment levels. States are free to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those levels in amounts that they alone determine are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. In certain cases, reduction by a State of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment levels below those established by section 1618 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act may result in the loss of the State's eligibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments pursuant to title XIX. In such cases, SSA has no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to order the State to reinstate its State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payment levels at or above the levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by section 1618. Accordingly, no purpose would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be served by permitting claimants to appeal a reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State supplementary payment levels below those established by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1618.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations should require SSA to afford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each affected recipient with written notice and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for a hearing, consistent with

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Publication of these regulations will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect SSA's current practice of first sending written notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the recipient informing him or her of the mass change and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its impact on his or her benefit amount or eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before effectuating any reduction, suspension, or termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a result of that mass change. Provision of such written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice is consistent with the requirements of &sect;&sect;416.1402(b), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
416.1404(c), 416.1413b, and 416.1336. Such notice will also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inform the recipient of his or her right to appeal the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination to reduce, suspend or terminate his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment as a result of the mass change. However, that right 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to appeal, and the corresponding right to request benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation, will be limited only to those cases in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the individual contends that our calculation of the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change in his or her State supplementary payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from the mass change is incorrect. Individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be informed that there will be no right to appeal the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination on any other grounds. As explained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion under Supplementary Information, we believe these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures to be fully consistent with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a mass change in State supplementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments, SSA must be prepared to carefully explain to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients the resulting adjustment in their benefit checks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and be prepared to handle a heavy volume of calls and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests for information from those recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We will ensure that our notice language will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly explain the mass change that is occurring; how it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will affect the recipient's monthly payment; and how, and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what instance, the recipient may invoke his or her right to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal our determination. In the event of a mass change, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will prepare our offices to respond to an increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phone-in inquiries and will issue to those offices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructional materials to assist them in responding to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inquiries. We have initiated these actions in prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances of mass change and expect to do so again as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need arises.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SSA should try to require States to provide advance notice to the SSI recipient community of the State's decision to
reduce State supplementary payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have no authority to compel a State to provide to its citizens advance notice of its decision to initiate a mass change
in the level of its State supplementary payments. We are generally informed of a State's decision to initiate a mass
change when such information becomes a matter of public knowledge. In the past, prior to initiating a mass change,
we have endeavored to discuss the impact with responsible State officials and expect to do this in the event of future
mass changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Supplementary Information section of the proposed regulations is misleading because recent legislation requires
States to pay fees for Federal administration of their State supplementary payments. This requirement is important
because it may affect the State's ability to pay the cost of State supplementary payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree and have amended the discussion under Supplementary Information to reflect the fact that as of October 1,
1993, we charge States that have elected Federal administration of their State supplementary payments an administration
fee for each supplementary payment made on behalf of the State, pursuant to section 13731 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66).

 SSA should inform each State of the potential loss of medicaid payments that can accompany a reduction or termination
of a State supplementary payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe that all States that supplement the Federal SSI benefit are aware that reduction of State supplementary
payment levels below those levels established by section 1618 of the Act may result in the loss of their eligibility
for payments pursuant to title XIX. Indeed, we periodically discuss with those States the impact of section 1618 of
the Act on their payment levels.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Allowing appeals in mass change cases only if the individual contests the computation of his or her revised State supplementary
payments creates a threshold jurisdictional issue that will further complicate the appeals process and will not
result in a significant cost savings to SSA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree. By limiting appeals only to cases in which the recipient disputes the computation of his or her State supplementary
payment resulting from a mass change, SSA will effect a significant cost savings. Furthermore, by prohibiting the
pursuit of such claims through the administrative and judicial process, SSA will avoid the substantial administrative
consequences that can result when large numbers of individuals who wish only to contest the propriety, fairness,
or legality of a mass change request appeals of reductions, suspensions, or terminations resulting from that mass
change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on our responses to the comments on the proposed rules, we have not changed the text of the proposed rules. In these
final rules, we made only several nonsubstantive changes to the proposed rules. We are, therefore, publishing the
proposed rules essentially unchanged as final rules.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains final regulations relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the export of certain vaccines and to the floor stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax on vaccines held on August 10, 1993. This document also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains final regulations relating to the floor stocks taxes on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel held on October 1, 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on diesel fuel held on January 1, 1994; and on commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel held on October 1, 1995. These regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect changes to the law made by the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1987 and the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993). The regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide guidance relating to the floor stocks taxes, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance concerning the person liable for each tax, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions to the taxes, and the time for reporting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paying each tax. In addition, the regulations provide guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to manufacturers of exported vaccines.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund (the Fund) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensates individuals who are injured as a result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of certain vaccines. Revenue for the Fund is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by a manufacturers tax (section 4131) on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccines. The tax, as originally enacted, was in effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only from 1988 through 1992, but OBRA 1993 applied the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax to vaccine sales after August 10, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA 1993 also imposes a floor stocks tax, which does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not appear in the Internal Revenue Code (Code), on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccines. The floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccines that were sold by the manufacturer, producer, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer on or before August 10, 1993, on which no tax was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed by section 4131, and that were held at the last moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 10, 1993, for sale or use. The rates of floor stocks tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are equal to the tax rates for sales by the manufacturer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer, or importer.

Written comments responding to PS&hyph;50&hyph;93 were received, but no

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the proposed vaccine export regulations and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed vaccine floor stocks regulations are adopted by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury decision, and the temporary regulations relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine floor stocks tax are removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of the comments received on PS&hyph;50&hyph;93 addressed the de 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimis exception to the floor stocks tax. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations provide that any person whose liability for tax does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exceed $1,000 is not required to report or pay the floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax. One comment requested that the de minimis amount be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased to $10,000. The de minimis exception was established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the administrative convenience of the IRS to eliminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessity of processing returns from persons holding small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of vaccines and having a small tax liability. The $1,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
de minimis amount is adequate for this purpose and the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is, therefore, not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment suggested that the exception be applied on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician-by-physician basis so that a group practice (such as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partnership or professional corporation) would have a de minimis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount proportionate to the size of the group. As noted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing the amount of the de minimis exception is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with its purpose. Further, if adopted, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion could increase the administrative burdens of the tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, allocation problems would arise if a physician is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in practice through more than one group (such as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partnership and a clinic or hospital). Accordingly, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion is not adopted. The comment also suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
de minimis exception be treated as an exemption and that only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of tax in excess of $1,000 be reported or paid. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion is inconsistent with the limited purpose of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception_to eliminate small returns. It is, therefore, not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OBRA 1993 makes several changes to the Code with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the taxation of motor fuels. First, effective October 1, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it increases the rates of excise taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and aviation fuel. The gasoline tax, under section 4081, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases from 14.1 cents per gallon to 18.4 cents per gallon; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the diesel fuel tax, under section 4091, increases from 20.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cents per gallon to 24.4 cents per gallon; and the aviation fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax, under section 4091, increases from 17.6 cents per gallon to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21.9 cents per gallon. These new rates include the 0.1-cent-per-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gallon tax that funds the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trust Fund. Second, effective January 1, 1994, OBRA 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally moves the point of imposition of tax on diesel fuel to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the terminal rack. Third, effective October 1, 1995, OBRA 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases the tax on fuel used in commercial aviation by 4.3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cents per gallon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA 1993 also imposes three floor stocks taxes, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not codified, on these fuels. The taxes are to be paid by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons holding fuel on the effective dates of the changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on gasoline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel, and aviation fuel that are held at the first moment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of October 1, 1993, at a point in the distribution chain where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these fuels would not otherwise be subject to the increased tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates. The rate of the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax is 4.3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cents per gallon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on diesel fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held by any person at the first moment of January 1, 1994, if (A) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no tax was imposed on the fuel under section 4041(a) or 4091 as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in effect on December 31, 1993, and (B) tax would have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed by section 4081, as amended by OBRA 1993, on any prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal, entry, or sale of the fuel had section 4081 applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fuel for periods before January 1, 1994. The rate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax is 24.4 cents per gallon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel held by any person at the first moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1995, on which the LUST tax was imposed under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4091 before October 1, 1995. The rate of the October 1, 1995, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor stocks tax is 4.3 cents per gallon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 29, 1993, temporary regulations (TD 8498) were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amending the existing temporary regulations to allow diesel fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the same day (58 FR 68338). On January 31,

1994, a correction to TD 8498 was published in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 4251). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments responding to these notices were received, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but no public hearing was requested or held. After consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of all the comments, the proposed floor stocks regulations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted by this Treasury decision and the corresponding temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations are removed. The comments made with respect to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary and proposed regulations are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments were received. One of the comments suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the requirement that diesel fuel be dyed at the time of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal from the terminal in order to be exempt from the floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax was too restrictive and that any diesel fuel held for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an exempt purpose that is eventually used for an exempt purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be free from floor stocks tax. This comment was addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in TD 8512, which allows diesel fuel that was dyed past the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminal rack to qualify for exemption from the floor stocks tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments suggested that fuel held in storage tanks below the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standpipe (dead storage) should not be subject to floor stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax. This suggestion was addressed in the preamble to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary regulations (TD 8498) and, for the reasons there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated, is not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notices of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their impact on small business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The principal author of these regulations is Edward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special Industries). However, other personnel from the IRS

Section 13421(c) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act imposes a floor stocks tax on any taxable vaccine (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in section 4132(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Code)_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Which was sold by the manufacturer, producer, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer on or before August 10, 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On which no tax was imposed under section 4131 (or on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which such tax was imposed and subsequently credited or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunded); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Which is held at the last moment of August 10, 1993,

Rates of tax. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rate of floor stocks tax on each

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The person liable for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor stocks tax on any vaccine subject to tax is the person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that holds the vaccine at the last moment of August 10, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993. For purposes of the floor stocks tax, a vaccine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held at the last moment of August 10, 1993, by the person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that has title to the vaccine (whether or not delivery to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that person has been made) at such time, as determined under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable local law. There is no exemption from the floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax for the United States or for State or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments. Each business unit that has, or is required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have, its own employer identification number is treated as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate person for purposes of the floor stocks tax.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise provided in this section, if the aggregate amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of floor stocks tax payable by a person does not exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Examples.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A holds 50 doses of DPT vaccine and 60 doses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of polio vaccine on the last moment of August 10, 1993. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not a member of a controlled group. A is not required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report and pay the floor stocks tax on any of the taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccines because the aggregate amount of floor stocks tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable by A (determined without regard to this section) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not exceed $1,000 ((50&times;$4.56 per dose of DPT vaccine) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ (60&times;$0.29 per dose of polio vaccine) = $245.40). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 D, E, and F are members of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled group. On the last moment of August 10, 1993, D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holds 100 doses of DPT vaccine and 160 doses of polio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine; E holds 80 doses of DPT vaccine, 10 doses of MMR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine and 60 doses of polio vaccine; and F holds 20 doses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of MMR vaccine and 10 doses of DT vaccine. Without regard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this section, D is liable for a tax of $502.40 ((100&times;$4.56 per dose of DPT vaccine)+(160&times;$0.29 per
dose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polio vaccine)); E is liable for a tax of $426.60 ((80&times;$4.56 per dose of DPT vaccine)+(10&times;$4.44 per dose
of MMR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine)+(60&times;$0.29 per dose of polio vaccine)); and F is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liable for a tax of $89.40 ((20&times;$4.44 per dose of MMR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine)+(10 X $0.06 per dose of DT vaccine)). Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aggregate amount of floor stocks tax payable by all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members of the group ($1,018.40) exceeds $1,000, each member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the controlled group must report and pay the floor stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax.

The regulations in this subpart C relate to the fuel floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks taxes imposed by sections 13241(h), 13243, and 13245 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Act). The tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 13241(h) of the Act is imposed on previously taxed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel held by any person at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first moment of October 1, 1993 (the October 1, 1993, floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax). The tax under section 13243 of the Act is imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on untaxed diesel fuel that does not satisfy the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4082 (as amended by section 13242 of the Act) and that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held by any person at the first moment of January 1, 1994, at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point in the distribution chain outside the bulk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer/terminal system (the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tax under section 13245 of the Act is imposed on commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel on which tax was imposed under section 4091 (even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if only at the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financing rate) before October 1, 1995, and that is held by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person at the first moment of October 1, 1995 (the October 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995, floor stocks tax). The regulations in this subpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describe the specific fuels subject to tax, the rates of tax, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the persons liable for tax. The regulations in this subpart also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide exceptions to tax and requirements for payment of tax and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing a return reporting tax. This subpart is effective on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not apply to gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held exclusively for an exempt use. In determining whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline is held exclusively for an exempt use, the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An exempt use, with respect to gasoline, is any use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline (other than use in producing gasohol) that is described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 6420, 6421, or 6427 and that entitles the ultimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchaser to a credit or payment equal to the tax imposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4081. Thus, for example, exempt use of gasoline includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use on a farm for farming purposes; use in an off-highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business use; use in certain intercity, local, and school buses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusive use by a State or local government or nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational organization; and use in commercial aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Gasoline is held exclusively for an exempt use only if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the person that holds gasoline at the first moment of October 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, actually uses the gasoline in an exempt use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Gasoline is not held exclusively for an exempt use if, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the first moment of October 1, 1993, the gasoline is held for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resale (including resale to a person that will use the gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an exempt use). Thus, for example, gasoline held by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline service station for sale to a farmer for use on a farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for farming purposes is not exempt from the October 1, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor stocks tax. However, the farmer would be eligible to claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an income tax credit for an amount equal to the tax under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 34 and 6420.

Diesel fuel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to diesel fuel held exclusively for an exempt use. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use, the following rules in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through (iv) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An exempt use, with respect to diesel fuel, is any use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of diesel fuel (other than use in producing a diesel fuel/alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixture or as fuel in a diesel-powered train) that is described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 6427 and that entitles the ultimate purchaser to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit or payment equal to the tax imposed by section 4091. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, for example, exempt uses of diesel fuel include use other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle (as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;48.4041&hyph;8(b)(4) of this chapter), use on a farm for farming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes, exclusive use by a State or local government or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit educational organization, and use in an off-highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Diesel fuel held for use in a diesel-powered train is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exempt from the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(2) unless the fuel is held by a State or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. Thus, the exemptions for use other than as fuel in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel-powered highway vehicle and off-highway business use do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to fuel used in a diesel-powered train. See section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6427(l)(3) as amended by section 13241 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the person that holds the fuel at the first moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1993, actually uses the diesel fuel in an exempt use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Diesel fuel is not held exclusively for an exempt use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if, at the first moment of October 1, 1993, the diesel fuel is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held for resale (including resale to a person that will use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel in an exempt use). Thus, for example, diesel fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held by a retailer for sale to a construction company for use in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the construction company's off-road machinery is not exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax. However, the construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company would be eligible to claim a credit or payment equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tax under section 6427. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aviation fuel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not apply to aviation fuel held exclusively for an exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. In determining whether aviation fuel is held exclusively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an exempt use, the following rules in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through (iii) of this section apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An exempt use, with respect to aviation fuel, is any use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of aviation fuel that is described in section 6427 and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitles the ultimate purchaser to a credit or payment equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tax imposed by section 4091. Thus, for example, exempt use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of aviation fuel includes any use on a farm for farming purposes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusive use by a State or local government or nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational organization, and use other than use as a fuel in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aircraft in noncommercial aviation (as defined in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4041(c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Aviation fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only if the person that holds the aviation fuel at the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moment of October 1, 1993, actually uses the aviation fuel in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempt use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Aviation fuel is not held exclusively for an exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use if, at the first moment of October 1, 1993, the aviation fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is held for resale (including resale to a person that will use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aviation fuel in an exempt use). Thus, for example, aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel held by a fixed-base operator for sale to an airline for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in commercial aviation is not exempt from the October 1, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor stocks tax. However, the airline would be eligible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim a credit or payment equal to the tax under section 6427. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exception for gasoline or diesel fuel held in vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel supply tank.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to gasoline or diesel fuel held at the first moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1993, in the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in &sect;48.4041&hyph;8(c) of this chapter) or motorboat. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception does not apply to fuel held in the fuel supply tank of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a train or an aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)

In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not apply to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Gasoline that a person holds at the first moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1993, if the aggregate amount of gasoline held by that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person at that moment does not exceed 4,000 gallons; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Diesel fuel or aviation fuel that a person holds at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first moment of October 1, 1993, if the aggregate amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel or the aggregate amount of aviation fuel held by that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person at that moment does not exceed 2,000 gallons.

Coordination with other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In determining the aggregate amount of gasoline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel, or aviation fuel held by a person at the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moment of October 1, 1993, there is excluded the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, diesel fuel, or aviation fuel exempt from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax by reason of paragraph (a) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section (relating to fuel held for exempt uses), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) of this section (relating to gasoline and diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel held in the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motorboat). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
All amounts held subject to tax if threshold exceeded.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax applies to all amounts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, diesel fuel, or aviation fuel (as the case may be) held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a person (and not exempt from tax under paragraph (a) or (b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section) if the aggregate amount of fuel held by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person at the first moment of October 1, 1993, exceeds 4,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gallons in the case of gasoline or 2,000 gallons in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel or aviation fuel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aggregate amount of all gasoline held by all members of the

controlled group exceeds 4,000 gallons. A member of a controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group holds more than 2,000 gallons of diesel fuel or aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel if the aggregate amount of all diesel fuel or aviation fuel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the case may be, held by all members of the controlled group

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 1, 1993, A holds 10,000 gallons of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, 6,000 gallons of which are held exclusively for use on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a farm for farming purposes. The remaining 4,000 gallons are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held for use in A's highway vehicles. A is not a member of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled group. A is not liable for the floor stocks tax on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any of the 10,000 gallons because the aggregate amount of fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held by A for uses other than exempt uses does not exceed 4,000

 Every person liable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax must make a return of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 30, 1993, and is a return for the third calendar quarter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1993. A first return reporting only the October 1, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor stocks tax is also a final return and therefore, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the instructions to Form 720, the box for ``final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1994, by any person if_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) No tax was imposed on the diesel fuel under section

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Tax would have been imposed by section 4081, as amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by section 13242 of the Act, on any prior removal, entry, or sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the diesel fuel had section 4081 applied to the diesel fuel

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The person liable for tax on any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel subject to the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wholesale distributor or other registered producer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recreational boat operator, or other person that holds the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the first moment of January 1, 1994. Fuel is held by a person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the person has title to the fuel (whether or not delivery to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that person has been made) at such time, as determined under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable local law.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to diesel fuel held exclusively for an exempt use. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use, the following rules apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An exempt use, with respect to diesel fuel, is any use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of diesel fuel (other than in producing a diesel fuel/alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixture or as fuel in a diesel-powered train) that is described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 6427 (as in effect on January 1, 1994) and that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitle the ultimate purchaser to a credit or payment equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any tax imposed by section 4081 (as in effect on such date). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, for example, exempt uses of diesel fuel include use other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle (as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;48.4041&hyph;8(b)(4) of this chapter), use on a farm for farming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes, exclusive use by a State or local government or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit educational organization, and use in an off-highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Diesel fuel held for use in a diesel-powered train is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exempt from the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(1) of this section unless the fuel is held by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State or local government. Thus, the exemptions for use other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than as fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle and off-highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business use do not apply to fuel used in a diesel-powered train. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For circumstances in which diesel fuel held for use in a diesel-powered train may be exempt from the January 1, 1994,
floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax, see paragraph (b) of this section (relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption for dyed fuel) and &sect;47.3&hyph;6(a)(1), which exempts fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that was previously taxed under section 4041(a) or 4091 (as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on December 31, 1993).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the person that holds the fuel at the first moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1994, actually uses the diesel fuel in an exempt use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Diesel fuel is not held exclusively for an exempt use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if, at the first moment of January 1, 1994, the diesel fuel is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held for resale (including resale to a person that will use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel in an exempt use). Thus, for example, except in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case of dyed fuel described in paragraph (b) of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel held by a heating oil retailer for sale for use as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home heating oil is not exempt from the January 1, 1994, floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax. However, a homeowner who uses the fuel for heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes would be eligible to claim a credit or may be eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a payment equal to the tax under section 6427. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exception for dyed fuel. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The January 1, 1994, floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax does not apply to diesel fuel that satisfies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dyeing requirements of &sect;48.4082&hyph;1T(b) of this chapter by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 31, 1994, or by the time the fuel is sold by the person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holding the fuel at the first moment of January 1, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is earlier. Thus, for example, diesel fuel held by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating oil retailer for sale for use as home heating oil is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempt from the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax if the retailer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or another person has dyed the fuel and the fuel satisfies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;48.4082&hyph;1T(b) of this chapter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Commercial aviation fuel is held exclusively for use as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies for vessels or aircraft only if the person that holds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commercial aviation fuel at the first moment of October 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995, actually uses the aviation fuel in that exempt use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Commercial aviation fuel is not held exclusively for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as supplies for vessels or aircraft if, at the first moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1995, the commercial aviation fuel is held for resale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including resale to a person that will use the aviation fuel as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies for vessels or aircraft). Thus, for example, commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel held by a fixed base operator for sale to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airline for use in foreign trade is not exempt from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax. However, the airline would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible to claim a credit or payment equal to the tax under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6427.

The October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax does not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial aviation fuel that a person holds at the first moment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of October 1, 1995, if the aggregate amount of commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel held by that person at that moment does not exceed

2,000 gallons.

Coordination with other exemptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the aggregate amount of commercial aviation fuel held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a person at the first moment of October 1, 1995, there is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be excluded the amount of commercial aviation fuel exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax by reason of paragraph (a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section (relating to fuel held for an exempt use). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
All amounts held subject to tax if threshold exceeded. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax applies to all amounts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial aviation fuel held by a person (and not exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax under paragraph (a) of this section) if the aggregate amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of commercial aviation fuel held by the person at the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moment of October 1, 1995, exceeds 2,000 gallons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Controlled groups. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A member of a controlled group (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in &sect;47.3&hyph;2) holds more than 2,000 gallons of commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel if the aggregate amount of all commercial aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel held by all members of the controlled group exceeds 2,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gallons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following example illustrates the rules of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this paragraph (b):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
D, E, and F are members of the same controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group. On October 1, 1995, D holds 2,000 gallons of commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel. E holds 1,500 gallons of commercial aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel, and F holds 500 gallons of commercial aviation fuel. None 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the commercial aviation fuel is held for an exempt use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the aggregate amount held by all members of the group is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4,000 gallons, which exceeds 2,000 gallons, all commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel held by each member is subject to the floor stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax. Thus, D is liable for tax of $86.00 (2,000&times;$.043), E is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liable for tax of $64.50 (1,500&times;$.043), and F is liable for tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of $21.50 (500&times;$.043).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1996. A first return reporting only October 1, 1995, floor

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA is taking action to approve the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) Inspection and Maintenance
(I/M) State Implementation Plan (SIP), which includes a SIP narrative entitled ``Revisions to the State Implementation
Plan (SIP) for the Control of Ozone Air Pollution_Inspection/Maintenance SIP for Dallas/Fort Worth, El Paso, Beaumont/Port
Arthur, and Houston/Galveston Ozone Nonattainment Areas,'' and Regulation IV, 31 TAC 114.3, entitled ``Vehicle
Emissions Inspection and Maintenance Program,'' as a revision to the Texas SIP for ozone in all four nonattainment
areas and carbon monoxide in El Paso. On November 12, 1993, and on March 9, 1994, Texas submitted SIP revision requests
to the EPA to satisfy the requirements of sections 182(b)(4) and 182(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA),
42 U.S.C. 7511a(b)(4) and 7511a(c)(3) and Federal I/M rule 40 CFR Part 51 subpart S. These SIP revisions will require
vehicle owners to comply with the Texas I/M program in the four Texas ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate
or worse which includes El Paso also classified as nonattainment area for carbon monoxide. This revision applies
to the Texas counties of Brazoria, Chambers, Collin, Dallas, Denton, El Paso, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Jefferson,
Liberty, Montgomery, Orange, Tarrant, and Waller. On May 18, 1994 (59 FR 25867), the EPA published a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Texas. The NPR proposed approval of the Texas I/M SIP submitted by the State. No public
comments were received on the NPR; therefore, the EPA is publishing this final action.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, requires States to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement
new ones. Section 182(a)(2)(B) required any ozone nonattainment area which has been classified as ``marginal''
(pursuant to section 181(a) of the CAA) or worse with an existing I/M program that was part of a SIP, or any area that was
required by the 1977 Amendments to the CAA to have an I/M program, to immediately submit a SIP revision to bring the program
up to the level required in past EPA guidance or to what had been committed to previously in the SIP, whichever was more
stringent. All carbon monoxide nonattainment areas were also subject to this requirement to improve existing or
previously required programs to this level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, all ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse must implement a basic or an enhanced I/M
program depending upon its classification, regardless of previous requirements. In addition, Congress directed
the EPA in section 182(a)(2)(B) to publish updated guidance for State I/M programs, taking into consideration findings
of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The States were to incorporate this guidance
into the SIP for all areas required by the CAA to have an I/M program. Ozone nonattainment areas classified as ``serious''
or worse with populations of 200,000 or more, and CO nonattainment areas with design values above 12.7 parts per million
(ppm.) and populations of 200,000 or more, and metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 100,000 or more
in the northeast ozone transport region were required to meet EPA guidance for enhanced I/M programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has designated four areas as ozone nonattainment in the State of Texas. The Houston/Galveston ozone nonattainment
area is classified as severe and contains the following eight counties: Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston,
Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller. The Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment area is classified as serious
and contains the following three counties: Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange. The 1980 population of the Beaumont/Port
Arthur area was less than 200,000. The El Paso ozone nonattainment area is classified as serious and contains the county
of El Paso. The Dallas/Fort Worth ozone nonattainment area is classified as moderate and contains the following four
counties: Collin, Dallas, Denton, and Tarrant. The designations for ozone were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (FR) on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992, and have been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). See
56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR sections 81.300&hyph;81.437.
In addition, a segment of El Paso Texas has been designated nonattainment for carbon monoxide (CO) and classified
as moderate with a design value below 12.7 ppm., under sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186(a) of the CAA. See 56 FR 56694 (November
6, 1991) and 57 FR 13498 and 13529 (April 16, 1992). Based on these nonattainment designations and populations, basic
I/M programs are required in the Beaumont/Port Arthur and Dallas/Fort Worth urbanized areas, while enhanced I/M
programs are required in the El Paso and Houston/Galveston urbanized areas.

On May 18, 1994 (59 FR 25867), the EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Texas. The NPR
proposed approval of the Texas I/M SIP submitted by the State. No public comments were received on the NPR.

Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By this action, the EPA is approving this submittal. The EPA has reviewed the State submittal against the statutory
requirements and for consistency with the EPA regulations and finds it to be acceptable. The rationale for the EPA's
action is explained in the NPR and will not be restated here.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economical,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted elsewhere in this action, the EPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result,
the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures published
in the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214), and revisions to these procedures issued on October 4, 1993, in an EPA memorandum
entitled ``Changes to State Implementation Plan (SIP) Tables.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office
of Management and Budget has exempted this action from E.O. 12866 review.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is today announcing an Administrative Stay of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) section
313 toxic chemical release reporting requirements for hydrogen sulfide (CAS No. 7783&hyph;06&hyph;4) and methyl
mercaptan (CAS No. 74&hyph;93&hyph;1). These two chemicals were added to the 40 CFR part 372 Subpart D list of toxic
chemicals in a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 1, 1993. The effect of this stay is to defer reporting on these two chemicals while the Agency reviews new
data and information made available subsequent to the promulgation of the final rule. The Agency will make this information
available for public comment, in a forthcoming 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice and will also at that time seek public comment on whether the Agency should propose to delete one or both of these
chemicals from the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. After evaluating the information and public comments
the Agency will either propose to delete one or both of these chemicals or will reaffirm its original findings and dissolve
this Administrative Stay. Today's action has no effect on any aspect of EPCRA section 313 toxic chemical release reporting
other than hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. 11023 (EPCRA) requires certain
facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals to report their environmental
releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such facilities also must report pollution
prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C.
13106). Section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and
20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria
for these actions. Under section 313(e), any person may petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the
list. EPA has added and deleted chemicals from the original statutory list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 1, 1993 (58 FR 63500), the Agency published a final rule adding 21 chemicals and 2 chemical categories to
the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) section 313 list of toxic chemicals. The December
1993 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document was a result of a petition submitted to the Agency by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Governor
of New York. The petition asked the Agency to add 80 chemicals and 2 chemical categories to the EPCRA section 313 list
of toxic chemicals. EPA proposed to grant this petition in part in a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41020). In the final rule, EPA added to the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals 21 chemicals
and 2 chemical categories. Included among the 21 chemicals and 2 chemical categories in the December 1993 final rule
were hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. The Agency found that hydrogen sulfide met the section 313(d)(2)(B)
criteria for cancer or other chronic human toxicity and the section 313(d)(2)(C) criteria for environmental toxicity.
EPA found that methyl mercaptan met the section 313(d)(2)(B) criteria for cancer or other chronic human toxicity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Basis for Administrative Stay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the promulgation of the final rule adding hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan to the list of toxic chemicals,
additional information concerning these chemicals has been brought to the Agency's attention. The Agency has also
learned that some members of the regulated community are concerned that the basis for the Agency's final action on
these chemicals was inadequately described in the rulemaking record. Furthermore, these members of the regulated
community have charged that the Agency violated various requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act in promulgating
the final listings of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. These issues are summarized below. The Agency feels
that it is important and appropriate to administratively stay the effectiveness of the listing of these two chemicals
while giving the public an opportunity to comment on these issues and the additional information, as well as to comment
on whether the Agency's initial determination that both hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan satisfy the section
313(d) criteria for addition to the list of toxic chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To that end, in conjunction with this Administrative Stay, the Agency will be issuing a forthcoming 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice which will seek comment on the Agency's initial determination for these two chemicals, the additional information
which has been brought to the Agency's attention, procedural issues concerning the initial final rule, and generally,
comments (and any supporting data) on whether the Agency should either propose to delete one or both of the chemicals
or affirm its initial determination and dissolve today's Administrative Stay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the final rule, reporting for hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan are required beginning with activities
during the 1994 calendar year, with the first reports due on July 1, 1995. Because of the controversy surrounding the
listing of these two chemicals and the decision to issue this Administrative Stay, EPA finds it unnecessary and inappropriate
to subject facilities, some of whom may be subject to section 313 reporting for the first time because of the listing
of hydrogen sulfide or methyl mercaptan, to the burden of collecting release information and preparing to file Toxic
Release Inventory (TRI) Form R reports for the 1994 reporting year. Therefore, pending a decision by the Agency of
whether to propose to delete one or both of the chemicals or to affirm its final rule determination, the effectiveness
of the listing of these two chemicals on the list of toxic chemicals is administratively stayed. EPA's decision will
be made promptly after consideration of public comment submitted on the pending 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Substantive and Procedural Issues Surrounding Final EPCRA Section 313 Listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Agency will soon be issuing a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice and seeking public comment, the following is a brief summary of the issues and new information related to hydrogen
sulfide and methyl mercaptan which support this Administrative Stay. In addition, a brief discussion of the use of
exposure analysis under section 313 listing determinations also follows. This is another issue the Agency will be
presenting in the upcoming 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hydrogen sulfide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Concern has been expressed that the Agency shifted its basis for adding hydrogen sulfide to the EPCRA section 313
list between the NPRM and the final rule. EPA proposed to list hydrogen sulfide because it exhibited chronic human
toxic effects, specifically citing respiratory effects. In the final rule, the Agency agreed with commenters who
argued that some of the respiratory effects cited in the proposal (inflammation, edema, cellular necrosis, hyperplasia,
and exfoliation) were better characterized as acute effects than as chronic effects. The Agency nonetheless listed
hydrogen sulfide for chronic effects because the observed neurotoxic effects, such as insomnia, anxiety, perceptual
ability and cognitive impairments were chronic in nature. Although the statutory basis for the determination did
not change, the Agency cited chronic neurotoxic effects in the final rule and chronic respiratory effects in the NPRM.
EPA recognizes that, although its ultimate finding remained unchanged in the final rule, interested parties may
disagree with the Agency's position that the information on neurotoxicity supports a finding under section 313(d)(2)(B).
EPA believes good cause exists to issue this Administrative Stay to allow parties time to prepare and submit comment
and information on this point. As noted earlier, the pending 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice will provide the mechanism for submitting any comments and relevant information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methyl mercaptan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As with hydrogen sulfide, concerns have been raised about the basis for listing methyl mercaptan as discussed in
the NPRM and in the final rule. EPA proposed to list methyl mercaptan because scientific evidence showed that it exhibited
chronic human toxicity effects, specifically citing neurotoxicity. The Agency affirmed this finding in the final
rule. Since the publication of the final rule, however, it has come to the Agency's attention that one of the scientific
sources relied upon by the Agency in making this determination may have been inaccurately or incompletely summarized
from the original source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing the available information for methyl mercaptan, EPA relied on Sandmeyer, ``Organic Sulfur Compounds,''
in Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology handbook, a common chemical reference work (Ref. 2). Sandmeyer, in
turn, appears to have relied on another work by Kvartovkina and Moerson, (Ref. 1), a 1974 work published in Russian.
When translated (a translation of the article will be provided as part of the record for the forthcoming 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice), there are a number of additional factors and limitations which may diminish the usefulness of this study
for purposes of EPCRA section 313 listing determinations. For example, the findings in the original study were made,
collectively, for a number of chemicals, one of which was methyl mercaptan. These potential translation and summary
problems were not presented to EPA during the public comment period, nor was the Agency independently aware of the
original Russian source. Given the Agency's longstanding intent to base its decisions on sound science and the potential
problems posed by the above information, EPA believes good cause exists to issue this Administrative Stay to allow
parties time to review the full information and prepare and submit comment on this point through the pending 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis of exposure to hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several representatives of the regulated community have expressed concern that, in listing hydrogen sulfide and
methyl mercaptan, EPA was unclear in its application of the statutory criteria. Among other things, charges have
been made that EPA's decision not to include evidence of exposure in deciding to list hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan
on the basis of chronic human toxicity was inconsistent with past Agency practice. These charges raise important
and potentially far reaching issues of the Agency's interpretation of its mandate under the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not agree that it has inconsistently approached the issue of the use of exposure analysis in EPCRA section
313 listings. However, many members of the regulated community have expressed dissatisfaction, alleging that the
Agency has neither consistently or correctly addressed the issue of exposure. The Agency believes that a consistent
approach to the EPCRA section 313 listing process is both necessary and important and that, given the charges of inconsistency
with respect to exposure analysis, the public deserves an opportunity to be presented with further clarification
of the Agency's position on this critical issue. A more complete discussion of this issue will be provided in the pending

. As described above, the Agency believes that this Administrative Stay is appropriate and in the interests of justice,
given the allegations of procedural and substantive deficiencies surrounding the Agency's listing of these two
chemicals, and the resulting controversy and confusion in the regulated community. Although the Agency does not
regard today's action as a rule, were it to be viewed as a rule, the Agency believes that there is good cause for issuing
it without prior notice and opportunity for comment and for making it immediately effective. Under section 313(a),
facilities face a current and ongoing obligation to collect information about releases of hydrogen sulfide and methyl
mercaptan. Such activities are potentially quite burdensome, particularly for any facility made subject to section
313 reporting requirements for the first time because of the listing of these two chemicals. Until such time as the
issues described in this document are resolved, EPA believes that today's Administrative Stay is necessary. As stated
above, EPA will be issuing a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to begin addressing these issues and will move with dispatch toward final resolution of the status of these two chemicals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this Administrative Stay is authorized by 5 U.S.C. section 705, which provides that an agency may postpone
the effective date of action taken by it when justice so requires, pending judicial review. No petition for review
has been formally filed as of this date with respect to the listing of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. However,
both the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the American Forest and Paper Association have told the Agency that
unless administrative action is taken to resolve the issues outlined in today's document, a prompt legal challenge
will be brought. These two organizations represent the interests of a large portion of the facilities subject to section
313, including those affected by the listing of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. The Agency believes that rather
than going through costly and potentially protracted litigation, an Administrative Stay coupled with a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice and opportunity to comment is both consistent with the goal of the TRI program to involve the public in the resolution
of important issues and clearly in the interests of justice.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule withdraws regulations setting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth a mandatory budgetary method for determining financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for individuals who are not receiving or deemed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be receiving Federal cash assistance but whose financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for Medicaid is being determined through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of financial criteria of the Aid to Families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. These regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were previously issued as part of a final rule with comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period originally published on January 19, 1993, and were to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be effective October 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule also makes conforming technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes, as a result of this withdrawal, to the remainder of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the January 19, 1993, final rule and reaffirms the August 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18, 1994, effective date of this remaining part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes are being made as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of public comments received.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 19, 1993 (58 FR 4931), we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a final rule with comment period that amended the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for coverage of certain groups of individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Medicaid and the requirements for determining Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility. Because the new administration wanted to fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review the policies in these regulations, on February 19, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, we published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9120) delaying the effective dates and compliance dates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule with comment period for 6 months. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dates were extended for two additional 6-month periods in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent notices published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 23, 1993 (58 FR 44457) and February 18, 1994 (59 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8138). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations incorporated into the Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations substantive changes made in the composition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility groups of individuals and in the criteria used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine their financial eligibility under Medicaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The substantive changes were initially made by the Omnibus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA '81), Public Law 97&hyph;35, and the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility
Act of 1982 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TEFRA), Public Law 97&hyph;248, and further amended by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DRA), Public Law 98&hyph;369; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(COBRA), Public Law 99&hyph;272; the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86), Public Law 99&hyph;509; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;93; the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100&hyph;203; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 100&hyph;360; the Family Support Act of 1988, Public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Law 100&hyph;485; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OBRA '89), Public Law 101&hyph;239; and the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101&hyph;508. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the document contained changes made as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of administrative decisions to improve program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration and efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basically, the January 1993 rule had two parts with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different effective dates. The first part codified a number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of statutory changes dating as far back as 1981. This part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was classified as a final rule. As extended by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent notices to the January 1993 publication, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date for these regulations is August 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second part of the January 1993 rule set forth a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandated budgeting method for determining the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility of individuals who are not receiving or deemed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be receiving Federal cash assistance but whose financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for Medicaid is being determined through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of the financial criteria under the Aid to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program (referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as ``AFDC-related non-cash assistance individuals''). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part was classified as a final rule with comment period. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended by the subsequent notices to the January 1993 rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effective date for this part is October 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budgetary method set forth in the regulations was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed to clarify contradictory provisions in the Social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act (the Act) that had resulted in litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basically, title XIX of the Act (section 1902(a)(10)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that the methods of the Federal cash assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program most closely related to the individual's status be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to determine income and resources for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid eligibility. At the same time, title XIX (section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(17)(D)) prohibits use of some of those same methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without specifying what should be used in their place. That 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is, section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act prohibits the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of income and resources of family members as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to applicants and recipients (unless actually made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available) except (1) an applicant or recipient for his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her respective spouse; and (2) parents for their children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who are either under 21 or who are blind and disabled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of age. This requirement became a problem for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AFDC-related non-cash assistance cases when an AFDC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory change in 1984 mandated that all family members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
living together be considered one family unit for AFDC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility purposes and that the income and resources of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all family members be pooled. As a result, AFDC sometimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires attributing income and resources from persons other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than spouses or parents (siblings, stepparents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grandparents, legal guardians, and alien sponsors) as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the applicant or recipient. Use of the AFDC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for cases involving income from persons other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spouses or parents, however, is contrary to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1984, courts in a number of jurisdictions have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ruled that section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act, which limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose income and resources can be counted (unless actually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made available), overrides section 1902(a)(10) of the Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which requires that the AFDC methods be used to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases. These rulings left open the issue of what method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be used uniformly among States. Currently, States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are using a variety of methods for determining income for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid eligibility purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to our request for public comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1993 rule, we received many objections to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budgeting method set forth in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, we set forth in the January 1993 rule a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prorating method of determining eligibility for AFDC-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-cash assistance individuals. Under this method, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual members of the Medicaid budgetary unit would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their income and resource eligibility determined using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate standards that are calculated based on proration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing standards. Parents' countable income and resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be prorated equally among their dependents living in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the home, including non-Supplemental Security Income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependents who may not be members of the budgetary unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proration would also take into account the needs of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parents. We also addressed how certain types of income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be counted and how certain types of disregards would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We received comments from 13 States and 7 special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest groups. With one exception, all of the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objected to the budgeting method in these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These commenters stated that the new procedure was error 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prone and unnecessarily complex. In addition, they believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the required system and manual changes and personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retraining would result in significant administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We considered these comments, especially in the light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of health care reform legislation. We also worked with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid Eligibility Technical Advisory Group (ETAG) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop an acceptable policy. The ETAG prefers a policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that minimizes the disruption of current approaches. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also met with recipient advocates who endorse allowing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States a choice of several options, but strongly oppose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing the budgeting method in the referenced regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be one of these options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, we are withdrawing the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing the mandatory budgetary method for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals. By doing this, we are allowing States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility, within any constraints imposed by court orders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or agreements with recipient advocate groups, to interpret 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current provisions in the law. That is, at this time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the absence of specific regulatory guidance on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodologies for establishing income and resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals, States will be required to use methodologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that comply with the statute and any applicable court 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. Provisions of the Final Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of our decision to withdraw the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that require States to use a mandatory budgetary method for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining financial eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance individuals, we are making the following changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the January 1993 rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have withdrawn &sect;&sect;435.604, 435.606, 436.604, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
436.606. These sections contained the procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining income and resource eligibility for AFDC-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-cash assistance groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have removed and reserved &sect;435.113(b) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;436.111(b)(2). These paragraphs required States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide Medicaid to individuals denied AFDC because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involuntary inclusion of all eligible siblings living in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home as members of AFDC filing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have removed and reserved &sect;435.600(b) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;436.600(b). These sections referred respectively to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;435.604 and &sect;436.604, which have been removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised &sect;435.601 and &sect;436.601 by removing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (e) in each section. These paragraphs contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for exceptions to financial application eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodologies and State plan requirements that are no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable. We also have corrected related cross-references 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in paragraph (b) and (f)(l) of each section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised &sect;435.602 by removing and reserving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (d) and &sect;436.602 by removing and reserving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c). These paragraphs contain requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining financial responsibility of relatives and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals for AFDC-related non-cash assistance groups. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also have corrected related cross-references in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;435.602(a), 436.602(a), and 436.602(a)(2).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The remainder of the January 1993 rule is unchanged and is effective on August 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifies that a regulation will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the RFA, we consider all Medicaid providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as small entities. Individuals and States are not included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the definition of a small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 beds that is located outside a metropolitan statistical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule revises the January 19, 1993, final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule with comment period. We have decided to withdraw the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second part of that rule which basically codified a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory budgetary method for determining financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals. We concluded, along with a number of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities, that this provision would result in significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative costs. The mandatory budget method has, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, been withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule will take effect on August 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the withdrawal of the referenced regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimizes any unnecessary burden on the public, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best regulatory options have been selected. Further, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that these regulations will not lead to increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs. Therefore, we have determined that these provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will have a negligible cost effect and that a regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule will not result in a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant impact on the operations of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small rural hospitals. For these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons, we are not preparing analyses for either RFA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1102(b) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule does not contain information collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements; therefore, it is not subject to Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget (OMB) review under the Paperwork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12866, this final rule was reviewed by OMB.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Emergency Management Agency makes the final determinations listed below of the final determinations
of modified base (100-year) flood elevations for each community listed. These modified elevations have been published
in newspapers of local circulation and ninety (90) days have elapsed since that publication. The Associate Director
has resolved any appeals resulting from this notification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this notice. However, this rule
includes the address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base (100-year) flood elevation
determinations are available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications are made pursuant to Section 206 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and with 44 CFR Part 65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP and are also used to
calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations are made
final, and for the contents in these buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in base (100-year) flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.

The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because modified base (100-year) flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are required to maintain community eligibility in the NFIP. No regulatory
flexibility analysis has been prepared.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) By December 1, Scholars desiring Foundation support for graduate study the following academic year must submit
a proposed program of graduate study to the Foundation for approval. The graduate study program proposed for approval
may differ from that proposed by the Scholar when nominated for a Truman Scholarship. Factors to be used by the Foundation
in considering approval include being consistent with:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Field of study initially proposed in the Scholar's Nomination and Supporting Information Form;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Graduate school programs given priority in the current Bulletin of Information;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Undergraduate educational program and work experience of the Scholar; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Preparation specifically for a career in public service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Foundation approval in writing of the Scholar's proposal is required before financial support is granted for
graduate work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Scholars must include in their submission to the Foundation a statement of interest in a career in public service
that specifies in detail how their graduate program and their overall educational and work experience plans will
realistically prepare them for their chosen career goal in government or elsewhere in the public service. The Foundation
issues guidelines to help Scholars prepare their proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (d) After completing his or her undergraduate studies, a Scholar may request in writing each year a deferral of support
for graduate studies. Deferrals must be requested no later than June 15 for the succeeding academic year. Scholars
failing to request a year's deferral and to receive written approval from the Foundation will lose one year of funding
support for each year for which they fail to request and receive deferrals. Total deferrals may not exceed four years
unless an extension is approved by the Foundation. Extensions are generally granted only for Scholars attending
graduate or professional school and supported by other scholarships or private resources or for Scholars with commitments
to the uniformed services.

is eligible to receive up to $3000 for the senior year of undergraduate education. Scholars in graduate programs planning
to receive degrees in one to two years are eligible to receive up to $13,500 per year or $10,000 (adjusted annually from
January 1985 to reflect increases, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics), whichever is less. Scholars in graduate programs requiring three or more years of academic
study are eligible to receive up to $9000 per year for a maximum of three years.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, on its own motion, reconsiders several aspects of the competitive bidding rules adopted for personal
communications services in the 2 GHz band (``broadband PCS''). The amendments adopted: exempt entities owned and
controlled by Indian tribes or Alaska Regional or Village Corporations organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act from the affiliation rules for purposes of eligibility to apply for licenses in frequency blocks C
and F (``entrepreneurs' blocks''); and modify the rules governing the attribution of gross revenues, total assets
and personal net worth of investors in corporate applicants in the entrepreneurs' blocks to permit non-attributable
investors to own up to 15 percent of a corporate applicant's voting stock. The Commission's action furthers the congressional
policies of ensuring that all classes of designated entities are provided opportunities for meaningful participation
in broadband PCS spectrum auctions. It also introduces additional flexibility into the attribution rules to attract
investment to all types of corporations controlled by entrepreneurs' block eligibles and to increase the level of
participation by smaller corporate applicants which have not made a public offering of their stock.

requirements are intended to prevent entities that, for all practical purposes, do not meet the Commission's size
standards from receiving benefits targeted to smaller entities. These safeguards ensure, pursuant to Section 309(j)(3)
of the Communications Act, that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 designated entities are provided with meaningful economic opportunities to participate in the provision of spectrum-based
services. Generally, affiliation arises when the applicant (or an attributable investor in the applicant) controls
or has power to control another entity or if the applicant (or an attributable investor in the applicant) is under the
control of the other entity. In developing its affiliation rules, the Commission borrowed from rules that are used
by SBA to make size determinations, including guidelines used to establish when a firm should be deemed an affiliate
of an applicant and other safeguards designed to ensure that only qualified entities are eligible for special benefits
under the SBA's ``section 8(a)'' program. The Commission failed, however, to adopt an exemption in the SBA's rules
that excluded from affiliation coverage entities owned and controlled by Indian tribes or Alaska Regional or Village
Corporations. See 13 CFR 121.401(b), 121.1102(a), 124.112(c). SBA is required by statute generally to determine
the size of a small business concern owned by an Indian tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe) ``without
regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of tribal government, or any other business enterprise owned
by the tribe.''
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The SBA has incorporated these and other statutory provisions into its regulations.

3. We have reexamined our eligibility and affiliation rules and will make an amendment to these rules that is more consistent
with the other Federal laws, policies and regulations so as not to preclude the eligibility of entities owned and controlled
by Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations for entrepreneurs' block licenses and for the benefits accorded
businesses owned by members of minority groups. We believe that adoption of an affiliation exemption for Indian tribes
and Alaska Native Corporations for purposes of eligibility in the entrepreneurs' blocks is consistent with these
other Federal policies
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and complies with the congressional mandate in the auction law.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, this exemption will ensure that the congressional policies of ensuring that minority-owned businesses
have the opportunity to participate in spectrum-based services will apply to a class of designated entities, Indian
tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, that Congress has determined to be economically disadvantaged. Without
the exemption we adopt herein, the Commission would not be able to ensure that all classes of designated entities are
provided meaningful opportunities to participate in broadband PCS spectrum auctions.

4. We note that Section 7(j)(10)(J) of the Small Business Act gives the SBA the discretion to consider tribal and other
affiliations if it determines that one or more such tribally owned businesses have obtained, or are likely to obtain,
a substantial unfair competitive advantage within an industry category.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 We do not believe it is necessary to make such a determination for broadband PCS auctions.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The limited potential number of broadband PCS applicants that may benefit from this affiliation exemption will not
present any unfair advantage to other eligible applicants that have had gross revenues up to $125 million and assets
of up to $500 million. In addition, this exemption from the affiliation rules applies only to applicants for entrepreneurs'
block licenses owned and controlled by Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, not independent entities composed
of individual Native Americans or other entities composed of individual Native Americans or other entities owned
by members of this minority group. Thus, such entities will not have any unfair advantage over other minorities in
the entrepreneurs' blocks.

5. For purposes of determining eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, we also attribute to the applicant
(in addition to ``affiliates'' as discussed above) the gross revenues, assets and net worth of non-passive investors
in the applicant. The attribution and affiliation rules are designed to prevent ineligible parties from exerting
control or undue influence over firms eligible to apply for entrepreneurs' block licenses and to ensure that only

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 applicants receive broadband PCS licenses. At the same time, we recognized that passive investment in entrepreneurs'
block applicants would be critical to the successful development of these smaller companies. To balance these competing
considerations, we decided not to attribute investors in corporate applicants that own a 25 percent or less passive
equity interest. Passive equity in a corporate applicant was defined to include non-voting stock and no more than
5 percent of the voting stock. An exception was created, however for evaluating a publicly-traded corporation's
financial eligibility in the entrepreneurs' blocks: an investor's ownership of no more than 15 percent of the voting
stock in a publicly-traded corporate applicant would be considered passive equity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. We now believe that investors in all corporate applicants, including those that are not publicly traded, should
be able to include in their 25 percent passive equity investment up to 15 percent of the applicant's voting stock. Both
publicly traded and non-publicly traded applicants would have difficulty attracting substantial investment if
each individual investor could own no more than 5 percent of the voting stock. Investors that are prepared to devote
considerable funds to an entrepreneurs' block applicant should reasonably expect to exercise some ability to protect
their investment through a modest level of voting stock ownership. The 15 percent voting stock limit would, in this
respect, not rise to the level of a controlling interest, but, from the investor's perspective, could diminish the
substantial risks associated with committing funds to a PCS applicant and enhance the potential rewards for providing
start-up capital to these new ventures.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA is amending its Railroad Operating Rules and its Radio Standards and Procedures by removing requirements that
railroads file their operational testing programs, operating rules instruction programs, annual summaries on
operational tests and inspections, and their radio rules with the Federal Railroad Administrator and by substituting
requirements that railroads retain such records and make them available to FRA representatives during normal business
hours. FRA is also amending the Railroad Operating Rules by eliminating the requirement that Class III railroads
file their operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions with the Federal Railroad Administrator.
In addition, FRA is making technical changes to require railroads to record specific information when conducting
operational tests and inspections of their employees. Finally, FRA is changing the Railroad Operating Rules and
the Radio Standards and Procedures so as to allow retention of certain records by ``electronic recordkeeping'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, retention of a computer record in lieu of a paper record). These amendments are intended to eliminate nonessential
reporting requirements while enabling FRA to review meaningful data to determine the safety of a railroad's operations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 19, 1992, FRA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM'') on amendments to its Railroad Operating
Rules (49 CFR Part 217) and Radio Standards and Procedures (49 CFR Part 220). 57 FR 47603 (1992). FRA proposed to remove
requirements that railroads file their respective operating rules, radio rules, operational testing programs,
operating rules instruction programs, and annual summaries on operational tests and inspections with FRA in Washington,
D.C. and to substitute requirements that railroads retain these records and make them available upon request for
inspection by FRA personnel during regular business hours. FRA believed that these proposed amendments, if adopted,
would remove nonessential filing and reporting requirements while concurrently reducing the burden borne by the
railroads in paperwork and mailing expenses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA received written comments on the proposal from seven entities and conducted a public hearing at the request of
one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public hearing was held in Washington, DC, on December 14, 1992, at which four organizations were represented.
As a result of these comments and further analysis of the amendments proposed, FRA now publishes its final rule. FRA
recognizes the importance of a railroad's operating rules and its radio rules for moving trains and other pieces of
rolling equipment safely. The requirements promulgated in the final rule take this factor into account by balancing
FRA's interest in reviewing pertinent documents against the railroads' interest in reducing their paperwork burden.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule reflects reconsideration of the proposals announced in the NPRM. In the interest of reducing certain
paperwork requirements, FRA has adopted certain proposed revisions to the regulations. FRA has also authorized
railroads to retain information electronically so long as the railroads satisfy the stated conditions. Nevertheless,
FRA has retained the filing requirements prescribed in existing &sect;217.7 for Class I railroads and Class II railroads.

See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interstate Commerce Commission (``ICC'') regulations at 49 CFR Part 1201 and ICC General Instructions 1&hyph;1.
FRA has determined that its headquarters office, located in Washington, DC, needs to continue receiving copies of
the operating rules of national and regional railroads to remain apprised of such rules. Finally, FRA believes that
operational test and inspection records require more specific data elements. FRA has concluded that the newly identified
data points serve to clarify the existing information requirements by defining the individual sources comprising
each operational test and inspection.

Discussion of Comments and Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA received written comments from the American Public Transit Association, Association of American Railroads
(``AAR''), The American Short Line Railroad Association (``ASLRA''), Consolidated Rail Corporation (``Conrail''),
New Jersey Transit Rail Operations, Union Pacific Railroad Company, and United Transportation Union (``UTU'').
At the public hearing held December 14, 1992, four organizations participated: the Railway Labor Executives' Association
(``RLEA''), the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (``BLE''), AAR, and Conrail. The discussions that follow examine
the issues raised by the commenters and analyze the reasons behind the adoption of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whether FRA should abolish requirements that railroads file their operating rules, radio rules, and certain other
documents with FRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two unions representing railroad employees objected to the proposal that railroads merely retain their operating
rules, programs of operational tests and inspections, programs of instruction on operating rules, and annual summaries.
The UTU declared that FRA was abdicating its responsibility of reviewing the documents for regulatory compliance.
The UTU alleged that requiring the relocation of records to the railroad's system headquarters and division headquarters
would vest FRA's field inspectors with total enforcement responsibility and that, consequently, document inspection
would be entirely discretionary and no longer an integral part of FRA's safety assessment of a railroad. In other words,
the UTU claimed, FRA was sending a message that administering the operating rules regulations was no longer a priority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLE echoed the UTU's concerns, stating that the removal of agency review at the headquarters level represented
a priority shift by FRA to no longer monitor a railroad's compliance with its operating rules or operational testing
and inspection program (i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, efficiency testing program). The purpose of these regulations was to afford FRA headquarters the opportunity to
analyze the data from the submitted documents. FRA needed to review incidents where railroad employees violated
their employers' operating rules to determine whether these violations compromised railroad safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR, however, fully endorsed FRA's proposals to eliminate filing. The AAR saw the filing of operating rules and
related documents as unnecessary, burdensome, and serving no safety objective. Furthermore, the AAR noted that
the railroad divisions comprising each railroad's system already provide the regulatory documents that FRA field
inspectors request for review. Requiring relocation of these records to offices that are visited by FRA field personnel
would facilitate document accessibility and retrieval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASLRA also supported an end to the filing requirements. The ASLRA commented that these amendments would improve
efficiency and economy for the short line railroads and would promote review by inspectors familiar with a railroad's
operations. Three Class I railroads agreed that these measures would relieve burdensome requirements of photocopying
and mailing these documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although FRA proposed redesignating the locations of these records, FRA has reconsidered the impact this measure
would have on enforcement, accident investigation, and other functions. A railroad's operating rules and timetables
are valuable resources that are used by personnel of all disciplines in FRA's headquarters Office of Safety. For example,
at FRA headquarters, these documents are reviewed in conjunction with accident reports filed at headquarters under
49 CFR Part 225 by the railroad. The railroads' rules and timetables are also consulted during FRA headquarters' analysis
of draft accident investigation reports submitted by FRA field personnel. By maintaining a copy of the operating
rules and timetables of major railroads, FRA retains its ability to determine whether the operating rules themselves,
or violations of them, contributed to an accident. Retaining immediate access to these documents in Washington,
DC, provides FRA's headquarters office with an efficient means to identify unsafe or inadequate procedures and to
recommend practices that will ensure protection of train movements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA believes that ensuring safe train and other movements requires each Class I railroad, Class II railroad, the National
Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), and each railroad providing commuter service in a metropolitan or suburban
area to continue filing its operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions with FRA. These railroads
conduct extensive operations, all of which are governed by their operating rules. FRA's interest in reviewing these
documents outweighs the burdens imposed on the railroads to continue filing these records. Therefore, FRA retains
the existing filing requirements for these railroads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that the rules FRA is reviewing are current, each railroad subject to this requirement must submit
its operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions to FRA by December 21, 1994, and must submit
each subsequent amendment to these operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions issued after
November 21, 1994, to FRA within 30 days after it is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, FRA believes that the regulations on the operational testing programs, operating rules instruction
programs, operational test and inspection records (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
efficiency tests), and radio rules can be effectively enforced from the field. These records are better utilized
by FRA's regional personnel to monitor a railroad's compliance with the regulatory requirements. The field staff
are best situated to observe a railroad's operations and determine whether the operational testing programs, operating
rules instruction programs, operational test and inspections records, and radio rules are accurate and current.
Additionally, the field inspectors can examine the operational test and inspection results in evaluating an employee's
performance of his or her duties in accordance with a railroad's rules and instructions. FRA therefore adopts the
proposal requiring railroads to retain their programs of operational tests and inspections, programs of instruction
on railroad operating rules, records of operational tests and inspections (including annual summaries on operational
tests and inspections), and radio rules at the designated locations provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whether the three-year record retention requirements proposed in the NPRM for operational testing programs and
annual summaries of operational tests and inspections will enhance railroad safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed requiring railroads to retain their operational testing programs under &sect;217.9 and annual
summaries of operational tests and inspections under &sect;217.13(a)&hyph;(c) for three calendar years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA received comments supporting and opposing this proposal. The California Legislative Board of the UTU advocated
record retention, but argued that this information should be retained for a minimum of five years. The BLE recommended
that operational tests and inspections be retained for only six months to one year. Both the UTU and BLE stated that
record retention would enable FRA to accurately assess a railroad's history of safe operations by examining this
collected data. The unions believed that FRA could gain a wider perspective on a railroad's results of its operational
tests and inspections and thereby target potential hazards in operating rules application, understanding, and
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The railroads generally disagreed with the unions. One railroad urged FRA to modify its proposed retention requirement
from three years to one year. Likewise, the AAR and ASLRA concurred with this recommendation. Specifically, the ASLRA
claimed that the proposed three-year record retention requirement was superfluous given the recordkeeping requirements
already imposed on railroads under the Locomotive Engineer Qualification and Certification regulations (49 CFR
Part 240). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA disputes the ASLRA's judgment that these proposed requirements are duplicative. Part 240 addresses only locomotive
engineers (persons who operate locomotives), but to ensure the safe movement of railroad equipment, railroads also
routinely test conductors, operators, dispatchers, and maintenance-of-way personnel. All of these employees
are, at one time or another, placed in situations or conditions that require knowledge and execution of a railroad's
operating rules. Therefore, FRA believes that maximizing safety requires each railroad to retain its program of
operational tests and inspections for all employees covered by its operating rules.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA has concluded that a thorough analysis of a railroad's operating procedures requires adopting the proposal as
stated. Accordingly, all railroads must retain their operational testing programs and annual summaries on operational
tests and inspections for three calendar years. FRA believes that trend analysis of this data will serve as an effective
tool to assess a railroad's regulatory compliance. Inspectors can better recognize patterns of rules noncompliance
and efforts railroads have made to remedy safety problems uncovered by previous tests. The results of these tests
may be used as a barometer to measure the safety of a railroad and determine whether its level of compliance is improving,
deteriorating, or remaining steady. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Whether FRA's proposal requiring railroads to retain their operating rules, radio rules, operational testing
programs, operating rules instruction programs, and annual summaries on operational tests and inspections at the
system headquarters and all division headquarters is overly burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule identified two locations where railroads were required to retain pertinent rules and programs:
division headquarters and system headquarters. The NPRM proposed that railroads would retain their operating rules
and Radio Standards and Procedures paperwork at all of their division headquarters and at the system headquarters.
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
proposed &sect;&sect;217.7&hyph;217.13 (introductory text). FRA believed that most railroads already maintained
copies of these records at these locations and that, therefore, FRA's enforcement personnel would be able to effectively
and efficiently enforce Parts 217 and 220 by visiting any one of these sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal prompted a number of parties to comment on its usefulness. Four commenters argued that requiring the
railroads to retain the pertinent documents at their system headquarters and at all of their division headquarters
would impose additional administrative costs with no offsetting safety benefits. Two organizations suggested
that the operational testing programs and annual summaries be retained only at the railroad's system headquarters.
Another two parties recommended that each railroad's division headquarters retain only information that applies
to operations within that geographical division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA agrees with the commenters that the proposal was overbroad in scope. The final rule departs from the NPRM by requiring
that each division headquarters retain only those documents that the division applies and enforces (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
operational testing programs and operating rules instruction programs). Likewise, each division headquarters
must retain the records of operational tests and inspections conducted by that division. The proposal that each railroad
retain its operational testing program, operating rules instruction program, and annual summaries on operational
tests and inspections (for railroads with 400,000 or more total manhours) at the system headquarters has been adopted
unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA assumes that railroads with extensive operations conduct operational tests and inspections at all division
headquarters. Railroad safety requires that all employees responsible for train operations comply with a railroad's
operating rules governing train movements over a territory. Therefore, under final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;217.9(d), railroads with 400,000 or more total manhours will be required to retain their annual summaries
on operational tests and inspections records at their system headquarters and at each of their division headquarters.
Although two parties asked that the regulation be amended to require railroads to retain all of their annual summaries
only at the system headquarters level, FRA believes that this data must also be available at all division headquarters
in order for inspectors to determine the extent of rules compliance in other divisions and system-wide. This requirement
will not impose any further burdens on the railroads because, as one commenter noted, the railroads already maintain
copies of these documents at the division level and provide copies for FRA inspectors upon request. FRA believes that
effective inspections of annual summaries are best served by examining these records at a railroad's division headquarters
and system headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whether FRA should permit electronic retention of documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM never addressed this issue specifically. However, the proposal's emphasis on deregulation encouraged
several parties to recommend that FRA allow railroads to retain records and reports by electronic recordkeeping.
Both the written and oral comments stressed the cost savings that computer filing would provide to railroads. Requiring
railroads to retain the information in paper form would impose additional administrative and storage costs. Computer
storage of these documents would also enable the railroads to immediately update any amendments to their operational
testing programs and operating rules instruction programs. Moreover, one commenter argued that retaining ``hard
copies'' that contained historical data could create confusion in the offices that utilize the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the written comments and the transcript of the public hearing, FRA agrees with the commenters that
electronic retention is a practical alternative for railroads to comply with the regulatory recordkeeping requirements.
FRA thus authorizes railroads to retain their operational testing programs, operational test and inspection records
(including annual summaries), and instruction programs on operating rules by electronic recordkeeping provided
that certain conditions are met to safeguard the data entered and stored in a computer system. These stipulations
are stated in &sect;217.9(e) and explained in the Section-by-Section Analysis. Railroads that elect to use electronic
data processing systems to store their operating rules information must be certain that proper security measures
are implemented to ensure the integrity of the documents retrieved for inspection. Moreover, the information produced
by computer must be organized in a usable format to afford FRA inspectors complete access to the records. FRA believes
that electronic record retention is a viable option for the railroads provided that FRA's monitoring activities
to measure compliance remain unimpeded.

the public hearing, and further review and reflection within FRA. Where terms or paragraphs in the final rule differ

Section 217.7 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contains the filing and recordkeeping requirements with regard to operating rules, timetables, and timetable special
instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) provides that Class I railroads, Class II railroads, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation
(Amtrak), and railroads providing commuter service in a metropolitan or suburban area must continue to file their
operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions with the Federal Railroad Administrator. The
deadline for filing these documents is November 21, 1994. Most railroads are in compliance with FRA's existing provisions
concerning such filings. For such railroads, it is not FRA's intent that another copy of already filed material be
given to the agency. If a railroad currently has its documents on file with the agency, FRA will deem that railroad to
be in compliance with this section, if the documents are in effect on November 21, 1994. (In other words, if previously
filed documents are still in effect on November 21, 1994, then a railroad has complied with the new provision, having
filed before December 21, 1994.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) provides that railroads subject to the filing requirements must also submit to FRA a copy of any amendment
to these documents issued after November 21, 1994, within 30 days after it is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (c), Class III railroads and all other railroads subject to this part but not subject to paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this section must retain one copy of their current operating rules, timetables, and timetable special
instructions at their respective system headquarters. These documents must be made available to FRA representatives
for inspection and photocopying during normal business hours.

Program of operational tests and inspections; recordkeeping; annual summary on operational tests and inspections;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed amendments to &sect;217.9 called for railroads to retain one copy of their operational test and inspection
programs at all division headquarters and at the system headquarters. The final rule adopts this proposal with some
significant modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a) is adopted unchanged, with one exception: A railroad must now conduct its operational tests
and inspections in accordance with a program that it retains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) also departs from the proposed text. After November 21, 1994, a railroad must retain one copy of its current
program of operational tests and inspections. The program must be updated with any subsequent amendments. These
programs must be retained at the system headquarters of the railroad and at the division headquarters for each division
where the tests prescribed in the program are conducted (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the records availability may be division specific). In other words, if certain tests are not conducted in a certain
division, that division headquarters need not retain a copy of the program prescribing those particular tests. The
operational testing program must be made available to FRA representatives for inspection and photocopying during
normal business hours and must be retained for three calendar years following the end of the year to which it relates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria requirements stated in existing &sect;217.9(b) (1)&hyph;(4) and (6) remain unchanged, and a conforming
change is made to paragraph (b)(5): deletion of the reference to a program ``filed with'' FRA. Under final rule paragraph
(b)(5), a railroad must begin conducting operational tests and inspections within 30 days after November 21, 1994
or the date of commencing operations, whichever is later. This requirement will not affect railroads that are currently
in operation, given that the existing regulations already require railroads to begin their programs within 30 days
after they file their operational testing programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Redesignated &sect;217.9(c) (formerly &sect;217.9(d)) requires a railroad to keep a record of the date, time, place,
and result of each operational test and inspection that was performed in accordance with its program. Each record
must identify the officer administering the operational test and inspection and each employee tested. These requirements
clarify the information requirements provided under existing &sect;217.9(d) by identifying specific data points
each record must provide. These revisions will promote the examination of relevant information from captured data
sources, enabling FRA to determine the effectiveness of a railroad's operational testing program. The operational
test and inspection records must be retained for one calendar year after the end of the year to which they relate at the
system headquarters of the railroad and at the division headquarters for each division where the tests are conducted
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the records availability may be division specific). Additionally, railroads must make their operational test and
inspection records available to FRA representatives for inspection and photocopying during normal business hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA has decided to organize all provisions in Part 217 pertaining to operational tests and inspections under &sect;217.9;
therefore, &sect;217.13 introductory text and paragraphs (a) through (c) are removed and redesignated as &sect;217.9(d).
New paragraph (d) requires railroads with 400,000 or more total manhours per year to compile an ``annual summary''
recounting the number, type, and result of each operational test and inspection conducted, stated according to operating
divisions where applicable, which are the same requirements as provided under existing &sect;217.13(b). The summaries
should be indexed in a well organized format to facilitate efficient and manageable review. FRA has also concluded
that annual compilations of the total number of train miles and of the rate at which the railroad conducts operational
tests and inspections provide limited useful information; therefore, these existing requirements are removed
from the final rule. These compilations, redesignated ``annual summaries on operational tests and inspections,''
must be made available at each division headquarters and at the system headquarters by March 1 of each calendar year.
Such annual summaries are required to be retained at these locations for three calendar years after the end of the year
to which they relate and made available to FRA representatives for inspection and photocopying during normal business
hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New &sect;217.9(e) authorizes railroads to retain their operational testing programs, operational test and inspection
records, and annual summaries on operational tests and inspections by electronic recordkeeping, subject to conditions
stated in that provision. This provision provides an alternative for railroads retaining certain information as
required in the regulations.

Each participating railroad must have the essential components of a computer system (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a desk-top computer and either a facsimile machine or a printer connected to the computer to retrieve and produce
records for immediate review). The material retrieved in hard copy form must contain relevant information organized
in a usable format to render the data completely understandable. The documents must be made available for FRA inspection
during normal business hours, which FRA interprets as the time, any day of the week, when railroads conduct their regular
business transactions. Nevertheless, FRA reserves the right to review and examine the documents prepared in accordance
with the Railroad Operating Rules and Radio Standards and Procedures regulations at any reasonable time if situations
warrant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, each railroad must provide adequate security measures to limit employee access to its electronic
data processing system and must prescribe who can create, modify, or delete data from the data base. Although FRA does
not identify the management position capable of instituting changes in the data base, each railroad must indicate
the source authorized to make such changes. Each railroad must also designate who will be authorized to authenticate
the hard copies produced from the electronic format. In short, each railroad electing to electronically retain its
records must ensure the integrity of the information and prevent possible tampering of data, enabling FRA to fully
execute its enforcement responsibilities.

Program of instruction on operating rules; recordkeeping; electronic recordkeeping. Section 217.11 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

is revised to require that a railroad retain a copy of its instruction program on operating rules instead of filing
a copy with the Federal Railroad Administrator. Paragraph (a), which mandates periodic instruction of employees
whose activities are governed by the railroad's operating rules in accordance with a written program, remains unchanged,
with the exception that the system headquarters of the railroad is to retain a copy of the entire instruction program
and that the division headquarters for each division where an employee is instructed is to retain all portions of the
copy of the program that the division applies and enforces. (In other words, the records availability at the division
headquarters may be division specific.) Paragraph (b) mandates that after November 21, 1994, or 30 days before commencing
operations, whichever is later, a railroad must make one copy of its current program and one copy of any subsequent
revision available to FRA for inspection and photocopying during normal business hours. Paragraph (c) is added to
authorize a railroad to retain by electronic recordkeeping its instruction program on operating rules, provided
that certain conditions specified in &sect;217.9(e) (1)&hyph;(5) are met.

as &sect;217.9(d), &sect;217.13 is removed and existing &sect;217.15, ``Information collection requirements,''

provided under existing &sect;217.15(b)(4), redesignated &sect;217.13(b)(4), which is, therefore, removed.

provides that Class I railroads, Class II railroads, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and railroads
providing commuter service in a metropolitan or suburban area must retain their radio rules at all division headquarters
and at the system headquarters. Under subparagraph (2), Class III railroads and all other railroads subject to this
part but not subject to subparagraph (1) are required to retain their radio rules at their respective system headquarters.
These records are required to be made available to FRA representatives for inspection and photocopying during normal
business hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been evaluated in accordance with existing regulatory policies. The regulatory document is considered
to be a nonsignificant regulatory action under E.O. 12866 and is a nonsignificant rule under &sect;5(a)(4) of DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures [44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979] because it eliminates nonessential reporting
requirements while maintaining a high level of safety. FRA has prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket a regulatory
evaluation addressing the economic impact of this rule. A copy of the regulatory evaluation may be reviewed and copied
in Room 8201, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its regulatory analysis, FRA found that railroads will derive several benefits with the implementation of this
rule. First, the final rule eliminates or narrows the applicability of various requirements that railroads reproduce
and mail to FRA certain records and reports of operating rules and practices, thereby reducing administrative and
postage expenses. Although certain railroads will still have to submit particular documents to FRA, the final rule
removes most processing and handling expenditures associated with filing the paperwork requirements under existing
Part 217. Second, the final rule reduces Federal government labor costs necessary to examine, organize, and compile
the information since most of the records will be retained at the appropriate railroad offices. Finally, railroads
will be permitted to retain required information in an electronic format, thereby reducing storage and overhead
costs and facilitating access to selected records. The regulatory evaluation does not quantify the reduction in
costs available to railroads electing to exercise this option; therefore, this analysis does not reflect the economic
benefits gained from electronic recordkeeping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA estimates that, over a twenty-year period, this rule will cost the railroad industry a total of $786. The cost to
the railroads to comply with this rule is about $311 for the first year and $25 for every year thereafter. This cost burden
is attributed to the changes in recordkeeping requirements provided in the rule. The total benefits of this rule over
a twenty-year period amount to about $449,628 for reduced labor, copying, and postage costs in both the railroad industry
and government sector. In the first year, the savings are estimated to be $22,432 and $22,484 for each subsequent year.
The benefits will be about 447.52 times the costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires a review of rules to assess their impact on small entities. In reviewing the economic impact of the rule,
FRA concluded that it will not have any measurable impact on small entities. There are no direct or indirect economic
impacts for small units of government, businesses, or other organizations. Therefore, it is certified that this
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the provisions of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule establishing that any over-the-counter (OTC) drug
product for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps is not generally recognized as safe and
effective and is misbranded. FDA is issuing this final rule after considering public comments on the agency's proposed
regulation, which was issued in the form of a tentative final monograph, and all new data and information on drug products
for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps that have come to the agency's attention. This
final rule is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA.

 of October 1, 1982 (47 FR 43562), FDA published, under &sect;330.10(a)(6) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(6)), an advance notice
of proposed rulemaking to reopen the rulemaking for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug
products to consider the OTC use of quinine for the treatment of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, together with the recommendations
of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Miscellaneous Internal Drug Products (Miscellaneous Internal Panel), which
was the advisory review panel responsible for evaluating data on the active ingredients in this drug class. Interested
persons were invited to submit comments by December 30, 1982. Reply comments in response to comments filed in the initial
comment period could be submitted by January 31, 1983.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;330.10(a)(10), the data and information considered by the Panel were put on display in the
Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville,
MD 20857, after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's proposed regulation, in the form of a tentative final monograph, for OTC drug products for the treatment
and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 8, 1985 (50 FR 46588). Interested persons were invited to file by January 7, 1986, written comments, objections,
or requests for oral hearing before the Commissioner of Food and Drugs regarding the proposal. Interested persons
were invited to file comments on the agency's economic impact determination by March 10, 1986. New data could have
been submitted until November 10, 1986, and comments on the new data could have been submitted until January 8, 1987.
Final agency action occurs with the publication of this final rule on OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the agency's proposed rule on OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps (50 FR 46588), the agency stated that no active ingredient in drug products used OTC for the treatment
and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps had been found to be generally recognized as safe and effective and
not misbranded, but that Category I labeling was being proposed in that document in the event that data were submitted
that resulted in the upgrading of any ingredients to monograph status in the final rule. In this final rule, no ingredient
in OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps has been determined to be generally
recognized as safe and effective. Therefore, proposed part 343 (21 CFR 343), subpart E for OTC drug products for the
treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps is not being issued as a final regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule declares OTC drug products containing active ingredients for the treatment and/or prevention of
nocturnal leg muscle cramps to be new drugs under section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)
(21 U.S.C. 321(p)), for which an application or abbreviated application (hereinafter called application) approved
under section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355) and 21 CFR part 314 is required for marketing. In the absence of an approved
application, products containing drugs for this use also would be misbranded under section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C.
352). In appropriate circumstances, a citizen petition to establish a monograph may be submitted under 21 CFR 10.30
in lieu of an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule amends 21 CFR part 310 to include drug products containing active ingredients for the treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps by adding new &sect;310.546 (21 CFR 310.546) to subpart E. The inclusion
of OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps in part 310 is consistent with
FDA's established policy for regulations in which there are no monograph conditions. (See, e.g., &sect;&sect;310.510,
310.519, 310.525, 310.526, 310.532, 310.533, and 310.534.) If, in the future, any ingredient is determined to be
generally recognized as safe and effective for use in an OTC drug product for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps, the agency will promulgate an appropriate regulation at that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTC drug procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10) provide that any testing necessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness
issues that formerly resulted in a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of the results of that testing
or any other data, must be done during the OTC drug rulemaking process before the establishment of a final monograph.
Accordingly, FDA does not use the terms ``Category I'' (generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded),
``Category II'' (not generally recognized as safe and effective or misbranded), and ``Category III'' (available
data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testing is required) at the final monograph stage.
In place of Category I, the term ``monograph conditions'' is used; in place of Categories II or III, the term ``nonmonograph
conditions'' is used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule for OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps (50 FR
46588), the agency advised that it would provide a period of 12 months after the date of publication of the final monograph
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for relabeling and reformulation of drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps
to be in compliance with the monograph. Although several manufacturers submitted data and information in response
to the proposed rule, the data and information were not sufficient to support monograph conditions, and no monograph
is being established at this time. Therefore, drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg
muscle cramps that are subject to this rule are not generally recognized as safe and effective and are misbranded (nonmonograph
conditions). The agency also stated that if a safety problem is identified for a particular nonmonograph condition,
a shorter deadline may be set for removal of that condition from OTC drug products. As stated below, a safety problem
has been identified for OTC drug products containing quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps. Therefore, the agency has determined that initial introduction or initial delivery for introduction
into interstate commerce of quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps must
cease effective February 22, 1995. After that date, no OTC drug products that are subject to this final rule may be initially
introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless they are the subject of an approved
application. The agency is unaware of any quinine sulfate drug product for this indication that is the subject of an
approved application. Any such drug product in interstate commerce after the effective date of this final rule that
is not in compliance with the regulation is subject to regulatory action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the proposed rule on OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps,
three drug manufacturers and a nutrition information service submitted comments. One comment included a request
for an oral hearing before the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the administrative record closed, a citizen petition was submitted on December 1, 1988. In response to this
petition, nine additional comments were submitted. The Commissioner found that the petition and subsequent comments
raised safety and effectiveness issues that warranted consideration before the final rule issued. Accordingly,
under &sect;330.10(a)(7)(v), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commissioner determined that good cause was shown to warrant consideration of the petition and the additional comments
before the final rule issued. Copies of the comments received and the petition are on public display in the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Additional information that has come to the agency's attention since publication
of the proposed rule is also on public display in the Dockets Management Branch.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. One comment disagreed with the agency's determination that adequate clinical data did not exist to support the
Category I status of quinine for both safety and effectiveness for OTC use in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps (50 FR 46588 at 46590). The comment expressed the belief that sufficient evidence already exists
for this use of quinine. In support of its position, the comment referred to information it had submitted on December
27, 1982, in response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for this class of drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency discussed this information in the tentative final monograph (50 FR 46588 at 46589) and concluded that it
did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that quinine is generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC
use for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The agency identified the issues to be addressed
in studies before quinine could be reclassified from Category III to Category I (50 FR 46590 and 46591). The comment
did not provide any new information to address these issues. New data and information submitted by other interested
persons are discussed in section I.B., comments 4 through 9 of this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Comments on the Safety of Nocturnal Leg Muscle Cramp Ingredients
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Two comments contended that FDA accepted the safe OTC use of quinine sulfate for nocturnal leg cramps when it published,
and did not dissent from, the Miscellaneous Internal Panel's conclusions and recommendations that ``* * * quinine
appears to be reasonably safe over prolonged periods of time in generally recommended doses of 200 to 325 mg daily''
(47 FR 43562 at 43564).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the comments' contention, the record makes it clear that neither the agency nor the advisory panels accepted
the safety of OTC use of quinine for nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The July 8, 1977 report of the Advisory Review Panel
on OTC Internal Analgesic and Antirheumatic Drug Products (42 FR 35346 at 35434) summarized the safety of quinine
and stated ``Although quinine has demonstrated analgesic, antipyretic and muscle relaxant actions, its numerous
toxic effects give it an unfavorable benefit to risk ratio for these purposes.'' The Panel concluded that ``Until
controlled studies show that a dose of not more than 325 mg daily is safe and useful for relief of nocturnal leg cramps
the drug should not be available for OTC use for treatment of nocturnal leg cramps.'' While the Miscellaneous Internal
Panel's report stated that quinine ``* * * appears to be reasonably safe * * *'' (47 FR 43564), the Panel did not conclude
that quinine was safe in doses used for the treatment of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The Panel's recommendation that
quinine should be placed in Category III for use in the treatment of nocturnal leg muscle cramps cited the need for more
information about both safety and efficacy in its concluding statement (47 FR 43564). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph for OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle
cramps, the agency concurred with: (1) The Miscellaneous Internal Panel's classification of quinine sulfate as
Category III, and (2) the Internal Analgesic Panel's conclusion that the drug should not be generally recognized
as safe and effective (Category II) for this use until its safety and efficacy are demonstrated in controlled clinical
trials (50 FR 46588 at 46592). It is clear, therefore, that neither the agency nor its advisory panels have determined
that quinine may be safely used for this indication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Three comments stated that quinine has been safely used by millions of consumers for a variety of conditions, including
leg cramps, for more than 50 years, and that this long history of usage demonstrates the safety of quinine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General reference to the history of use of quinine cannot be accepted as evidence of its safety. Historically, there
has been no clear location for the organized collection and analysis of adverse drug experience reports on OTC drug
products. Adverse events associated with OTC drug products are still vastly underreported for a number of reasons.
First, for most OTC drugs there is no requirement that manufacturers and distributors report adverse events to the
FDA, even those that are serious or life threatening. Second, physicians, who are the principal reporters to the United
States spontaneous reporting system, may not become aware of reactions to OTC drugs. Patients often do not mention
OTC drugs in giving medication histories. If they do, it is often not clear to physicians to which manufacturer the
adverse event should be reported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Two comments in support of keeping quinine available OTC discussed the adverse event reports on file for quinine
in FDA's spontaneous reporting system. Lavy (Ref. 1) stated that there were 52 reports suggestive of hypersensitivity
reactions, including 8 deaths, among the reports on file from 1969 to 1988. Lavy concentrated on reports of thrombocytopenia
(a decrease in the number of blood platelets) and stated that bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia may have been
related to four of the eight deaths reported in this 20-year period. The comment stated that only one case provided
sufficient information to fulfill all diagnostic criteria for drug-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia (consistent
clinical history, exclusion of other causes, positive in vitro test and, theoretically, the demonstration of recurrent
thrombocytopenia after rechallenge). Lavy pointed out that adverse event reports should reflect a significant
prevalence of severe quinine-associated purpura (if occurring) because this reaction is readily identifiable
by the patient, physician, and hospital. Using industry quinine sales figures and data from the FDA spontaneous reporting
system, Lavy concluded that the number of reported quinine-related hypersensitivity reactions is quite low, even
if greatly underreported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aster (Ref. 2) reviewed adverse drug reactions reported to FDA from 1969 through December 1989 and estimated that
approximately 1,000 reactions in 313 individuals were reported for quinine. Aster's estimate was not limited to
hypersensitivity reactions, but included all reported reactions (including multiple reactions per individual).
Aster did not report the specific search criteria used to obtain the adverse drug reaction reports other than to state
that the ``FDA materials provide a cumulative listing of all adverse drug reactions (ADR) reported in connection
with quinine since 1969.'' After eliminating reactions considered highly unlikely to bear a cause-and-effect relationship
to quinine, Aster identified 254 reactions that he considered ``significant.'' There were 83 hematologic reactions
and 46 additional reactions possibly associated with hypersensitivity. Of 63 possible cases of thrombocytopenia,
36 included information verifying low platelet levels. Aster identified 50 fatalities (15 from hematologic complications,
3 from hypersensitivity, and 32 from other causes). Overall, Aster classified 51 percent of the adverse reactions
as idiosyncratic and eight percent as the result of overdose. The remaining 41 percent were of indeterminate etiology
and consisted of liver and kidney dysfunction, neurologic disorders, and various hemorrhagic manifestations.
Of the reports in which inadequate information was provided for full evaluation, Aster noted the possibility that
some of the six cerebrovascular accidents reported may have been associated with thrombocytopenia induced by quinine.
Aster concluded that: (1) No information is available that would enable the identification of people at risk to sensitivity
reactions to quinine; (2) the rarity of sensitivity reactions and the rapidity with which they occur make early detection
of such reactions impossible and, (3) the dramatic symptomatology of such reactions, when they occur, leads people
to seek prompt medical attention. Aster concluded, therefore, that serious adverse reactions would neither be prevented
nor reduced in incidence by restricting quinine availability to prescription status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the comments and the reports of adverse reactions to quinine products (listed in the agency's
spontaneous reporting system under quinine, quinine sulfate, and three brand name products used for the treatment
and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps). From 1969 through June 1992, FDA received 157 adverse reaction
reports in which quinine was listed as a suspect drug. There were 84 serious reactions: 23 deaths, 5 cases in which the
person was disabled, and 56 hospitalizations not involving death or disablement. Of the 157 adverse reaction reports,
52 (approximately 33 percent) did not contain dosage and/or product name information, or reported daily dosages
in excess of those typically recommended for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The
remaining 105 reports listed the names of quinine products labeled for use in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps and/or daily dosages recommended by these products, and included 60 serious reactions involving
16 deaths, 4 cases of disablement, and 40 hospitalizations not involving death or disablement. More importantly,
56 of the 105 reports (approximately 53 percent) have been received since 1988, and there is an alarming trend of increasing
numbers of reports per year since 1986 as the market for OTC drug products containing quinine for the treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps has expanded during that period. Approximately 70 percent (42 of 60) of
all reports of serious reactions, 44 percent (7 of 16) of all reported deaths, and 78 percent (31 of 40) of all reported
hospitalizations on file since 1969 were reported in the 4 1/2-year period between January 1988 and July 1992. There
were 20 cases (19 percent of reports on file) reported in 1991 alone: 3 were disabling, 11 required hospitalization,
and 1 resulted in death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nocturnal leg muscle cramps are a common condition in the elderly (Ref. 3). Presumably, with an increasing average
age in the American population, the market for OTC drug products containing quinine for the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps also increased during this period. The number of adverse reaction reports for people
60 years of age or older, involving quinine products and/or quinine dosages used in the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, has increased by a factor of five (from 2 to 10) during the period between January 1988
and December 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency conducted a detailed review of 110 reports on file from 1969 through 1990; 69 (approximately 63 percent)
of these reports involved hypersensitivity reactions ranging from rash and fever to angioneurotic edema, thrombocytopenia,
or generalized anaphylaxis. Of these 69 reports, 57 (approximately 83 percent) involved quinine products and/or
quinine dosages used in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. An attempt was made to identify
only those reports in which the relationship between quinine and the reported event was strong and reasonably unrelated
to other factors. Factors considered included the temporal relationship between quinine administration and the
event, absence of concomitant medications (or abatement of the adverse event after quinine was discontinued), absence
of confounding medical conditions, a positive test for quinine mediated antibodies, or history of a similar reaction
associated with previous quinine exposure. Using these factors, of the 110 reports 26 were identified in which it
can be reasonably concluded that quinine was the causative agent. These included 6 moderately severe to severe skin
reactions, 2 of which were erythema multiforme-like reactions; 13 hematologic events, with 2 resulting in death;
2 cases of hepatitis or elevated liver enzymes; 2 renal reactions, one leading to renal failure requiring dialysis,
the other leading to death; 2 cases of a hypersensitivity syndrome with symptoms that included chills, nausea, vomiting,
and diarrhea; and 1 report of anaphylaxis complicated by seizures and hypoxia following a single dose of quinine.
None of these cases reported an overdose of the drug, and 21 of the 26 reports (approximately 81 percent) involved quinine
products and/or quinine dosages used in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even using strict criteria to identify cases in which a causal relationship of quinine to adverse event is likely,
FDA finds that quinine is associated with serious adverse events. There is no compelling reason to restrict evaluation
of the safety of quinine to reported cases of thrombocytopenia, as Lavy did. The other adverse effects are also serious
and must be considered in weighing the benefits and risks of products containing quinine. The agency agrees with Aster
that there is currently no way in advance to identify people at risk of hypersensitivity reactions and, therefore,
no effective way to warn against use by such individuals (see section I.B., comment 10). It does not agree, however,
that physician monitoring might not minimize serious reactions. Thrombocytopenia, for example, can lead to bruising
and other evidence of cutaneous bleeding. A physician could warn patients to report such signs and stop the drug, perhaps
preventing a significant hemorrhagic event.

5. Several comments contended that the true incidence of quinine-induced thrombocytopenia is many times smaller
than that suggested by estimates based on events reported from exposure to quinine-containing drug products alone.
The comments contended that such estimates fail to account for the much larger exposure to quinine through beverages.
Lavy estimated exposure to quinine in beverages to be about 10 times greater than exposure to quinine in drug products
(Ref. 1). An agency search of the medical literature identified only 10 cases of hypersensitivity reactions attributed
to quinine in beverages (Refs. 2 through 9). One of these reactions occurred following ingestion of a drug product
containing quinine by a person presumed to have been previously sensitized by exposure to beverages (Ref. 5). None
of these events was fatal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency finds that the available information supports the safe use of quinine in beverages such as tonic water and
bitter lemon. Given the level of consumption of quinine beverages, there is a scarcity of reported hypersensitivity
reactions, even assuming that reactions to food products are vastly underreported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite these safety data from beverage use, the agency does not consider pooling total consumption and adverse reaction
data on quinine from food and drug products to be a legitimate basis to judge the safety of drug products containing
quinine. First, there are differences in the quinine exposure levels because quinine is present in much greater amounts
in drug products. Second, there is a great disparity in the incidence of reports of hypersensitivity reactions to
beverage and drug products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency considers the appropriate basis on which to estimate the incidence of hypersensitivity to quinine-containing
drug products in leg cramp sufferers is to evaluate reports of reactions in the people who take such products at the
dose, frequency, and for the duration recommended in product labeling. Adjusting the reported incidence of reactions
to drug products by pooling data on beverages erroneously exaggerates the risk of reaction to quinine in beverages,
vastly underestimates the risk of reaction to quinine-containing drug products, and contradicts the raw data on
these products. Both the number and the severity of reported hypersensitivity reactions to drug products containing
quinine raise safety concerns about these products (see section I.B., comment 4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency considers the virtual absence of reports of reactions to beverages containing small amounts of quinine
(i.e., not more than 83 parts per million) as support for the safety of such use. Thus, the use of quinine salts in food
in accord with conditions described in 21 CFR 172.575 is not affected by this final rule on drug products for the treatment
and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.

6. Four comments submitted five reports (Refs. 1 through 5) of controlled clinical studies of quinine alone or in combination
with vitamin E. The agency has reviewed these studies for evidence pertaining to the safety of quinine used to treat
and/or prevent nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first study (Ref. 1) was a 10-week, crossover study of 69 subjects randomized to either 260 milligrams (mg) quinine
sulfate or placebo. Subjects were 26 to 77 years of age, with a mean age of 51. Five adverse reactions to quinine (a 7 percent
incidence) were reported. One subject was unable to tolerate the quinine because tinnitus (ringing in the ears) in
both ears occurred while taking the study drug. Two additional subjects experienced tinnitus while taking quinine,
but continued the medication and completed the study (although the protocol called for discontinuation of the study
drug if ringing in the ears occurred). One additional subject experienced disorientation and another reported dizziness
while taking quinine. No adverse events to placebo were reported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second study (Ref. 2) was a 10-week, double-blind, randomized, crossover study of 62 subjects receiving daily
doses of either 325 mg quinine sulfate or placebo. Subjects were 21 to 76 years of age, with a mean age of 47. Three subjects
on quinine and three subjects on placebo reported adverse events. The quinine reactions included tinnitus (which
quickly resolved when the drug was discontinued), blurred vision, and headache, which occurred on 3 days during drug
administration. One of the subjects dropped out of the study because of dizziness and drowsiness. Another subject
discontinued quinine for the last two days of the treatment period because of tinnitus. In the placebo group, one subject
reported chest pains and heartburn; another subject experienced fever and nausea; and one subject reported constipation
and dropped out of the study. An additional eight subjects dropped out of the study for reasons described in the report
as not related to the drug products, but no details were provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third study (Ref. 3) was a 5-week randomized, crossover study involving 205 subjects randomly assigned to quinine
sulfate 260 mg/day, vitamin E 1,600 international units (I.U.)/day, a combination of quinine and vitamin E in the
above doses, or placebo. Subjects were 18 to 80 years of age, with a mean age of 44. Twenty-seven adverse reactions were
reported: 9 (4.4 percent) in subjects receiving the combination of quinine and vitamin E, 8 (3.9 percent) in subjects
on quinine alone, 6 (2.9 percent) in subjects on vitamin E alone, and 4 (2 percent) in subjects receiving placebo. There
was an almost twofold difference in overall adverse experiences when subjects were taking either of the test drugs
containing quinine. Adverse events in subjects receiving quinine alone included stomach cramps, headache, nausea,
diarrhea, swollen hands, and slight muscle twitching. Adverse events in subjects receiving the quinine and vitamin
E combination included upset stomach, headache, diarrhea, tiredness, constipation, and pain in the legs. Adverse
effects in subjects receiving vitamin E included abdominal cramps, vomiting, loose bowels, headache, and intensified
menstrual cramps. Adverse events in the placebo group included nausea, stomach cramps, and tingly fingers. Gastrointestinal
disturbances were reported by twice as many subjects when they were taking quinine alone or in combination than when
assigned to vitamin E alone or placebo. Most of the adverse experiences in this study, irrespective of treatment group,
were described by investigators as not related or probably not related to the study medication. Reported events,
however, were consistent with those classically associated with quinine toxicity, which includes gastrointestinal
symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), vasodilation, sweating, headache, tinnitus, vertigo,
and visual disturbances (Ref. 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth study (Ref. 4) was a 5-week, crossover study involving 24 subjects 51 to 64 years of age (with a mean age of
57). All subjects received placebo in weeks 1, 3, and 5; half of the subjects were assigned to quinine sulfate (260 mg
per (/) day) and half to the combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E during week 2. In week 4, those subjects on the
combination in week 2 were assigned to quinine alone and vice versa. Nausea was reported by 3 subjects (12.5 percent)
who received quinine sulfate during week 2. No details of the reported reactions were provided. No other adverse events
were reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth and largest study was a multicenter, block-randomized, parallel design involving 559 subjects 18 to 84
years of age (Ref. 5). A 1-week, single-blind, placebo phase was followed by a 2-week, double-blind, randomized,
treatment phase. Subjects who had at least one leg cramp per night for a minimum of 3 nights during the single-blind
placebo week and met other selection criteria were randomized to one of four double-blind treatment groups: Quinine
sulfate 259.2 mg (subject ages ranged from 19 to 79 years with a mean age of 46), vitamin E, 1,600 I.U. (subject ages ranged
from 18 to 76 years with a mean age of 42), a combination of quinine and vitamin E in the above doses (subject ages ranged
from 18 to 83 years with a mean age of 46), and placebo (subject ages ranged from 21 to 84 years with a mean age of 45). Besides
meeting the criteria for frequency of nocturnal leg cramps, subjects admitted to the study were generally in good
health, were predominantly female, and had a mean age of less than 50 years. The study report stated that no unexpected
or idiosyncratic adverse events were seen ``* * * among patients taking an effective course of therapy * * * nor was there
a higher than usual incidence of recognized adverse drug reactions associated with ingestion of quinine.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One subject randomized to the combination product was reported to have experienced a reaction consisting of fever,
headache, nausea, vomiting, and diffuse muscle pain after 5 days. The episode was sufficiently severe to warrant
medical intervention in which the test drug (quinine/vitamin E) was stopped and the subject was treated with analgesic/antipyretic
therapy and a prescription antiemetic. Symptoms subsided over 3 days. When the study medication was resumed, the
subject again experienced nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe headache, diffuse myalgia with severe pain
in the legs, and fever. The subject required hospitalization. Therefore, the study drug was stopped. When the subject
was discharged 5 days later, the physician advised her to consider herself sensitive to quinine. Given the temporal
relationship between the onset of symptoms and administration of the study drug as well as the positive rechallenge,
this case appears to be a well-documented hypersensitivity reaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, another subject on quinine experienced itching, nausea, and vomiting and discontinued the drug. Two
other subjects experienced moderately severe wheezing on the 8th and 12th days of quinine treatment, but neither
subject discontinued the medication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall incidence of adverse events reported in the fifth study (Ref. 5) was high and approximately equal in all
groups (quinine sulfate, 43.3 percent; vitamin E, 37.2 percent; the combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E,
39.3 percent; and placebo, 41.3 percent). Headache accounted for the greatest number of reported events in each group
(quinine sulfate, 19.1 percent; vitamin E, 16.8 percent; combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E, 19.1 percent;
and placebo, 21 percent), but did not appear to be treatment related. Differences in the side- effect profile of the
treatments emerge when only events with an incidence of 1 percent or more are considered, and both headache and events
considered by the investigators as not related to the study drug are excluded. This analysis shows an adverse event
rate of 12.8 percent with quinine sulfate (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, tinnitus, pruritus, and urticaria);
3.6 percent with vitamin E (nausea and myalgia); and 12 percent with the combination product (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
tinnitus, and fever). None of the events reported by subjects on placebo, which the investigators considered potentially
related to the study drug, had an incidence of 1 percent or more. Similarly, events reported to be severe or moderately
severe (excluding headache and events with an incidence less than 1 percent) were more frequent in subjects taking
quinine sulfate (6.4 percent) or the combination product (7.1 percent) than vitamin E alone (3.6 percent) or placebo
(2.2 percent).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for symptoms of quinine toxicity from the low doses generally recommended for the OTC treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps has been confirmed in several other studies (Refs. 7, 8, and 9). A recent
study of the relationship between plasma quinine levels and hearing impairment (Ref. 7) found that quinine, even
at low doses, produced auditory changes. In this study, single oral doses of quinine of 5 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg),
10 mg/kg, and 15 mg/kg were administered to six healthy females 24 to 39 years of age. The study did not specify subject
weights. If subject weights of 50 to 60 kg were assumed, these doses would correspond to single quinine doses of 250
to 300 mg, 500 to 600 mg, and 750 to 900 mg, respectively. Even at the lowest dose (which is equivalent to the dose used
in OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps), a drug effect on hearing
impairment was detected in half of the subjects. When plasma concentrations exceeded 15 micromoles/liter (mmol/L),
subjective hearing loss or tinnitus was observed in all subjects. No symptoms were detectable at levels below 5 mmol/L.
The shift in hearing threshold was equal over the frequency range studied. The effect over time was consistent with
the level of the dose given. The investigators concluded that a consistent effect-concentration relationship for
hearing impairment caused by quinine can be defined by audiometry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Zajtchuk (Ref. 8) compared the effect on vestibular and auditory function of 0, 52.5 mg, and 105 mg quinine administered
in the form of commercial tonic water (containing 52.5 mg of quinine per 822 milliliter (mL) bottle) in 17 active duty
military personnel. The study was initiated following findings of low levels of quinine in post-mortem tissues from
military pilot fatalities. Tonic water was administered over a 3-hour period daily for 14 days. While control subjects
and subjects given the low dose had normal function throughout the test, three of the four subjects given 105 mg/day
developed transient vestibular abnormalities (manifested by rapid, involuntary, rhythmic movements of the eyeball
associated with certain positions of the head or body) on positional testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Worden, Shephard, and Frape (Ref. 9) conducted two similar studies. In one study, 6 men and 14 women (18 to 39 years of
age) were given 100 mg quinine hydrochloride daily in the form of tonic water for 14 days. In the second study, 4 men and
6 women (18 to 53 years of age) were divided into 2 groups. One group received 120 mg in a fortified tonic water, while
the other drank a carbonated drink without quinine. No audiometric changes were found in any of the subjects in either
study. However, 12 subjects (60 percent) in the first study complained of visual disturbances, 14 (70 percent) reported
dizziness, and 14 (70 percent) experienced headache.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for adverse effects from quinine may be greater in the elderly. A survey at one hospital (Ref. 10) of 201
inpatients 70 years of age or older found that 23 (11 percent) were taking quinine for cramps. Sixty percent were taking
300 mg nightly; 40 percent were taking twice that amount (600 mg nightly). Approximately one-third of these subjects
had been taking the drug continuously and chronically for 2 years or more. The authors noted that the mean elimination
half-life of quinine in elderly patients has been reported to be 19 hours compared with 8.5 hours in younger adults.
The authors also stated that ``Chronic therapy is likely to result in accumulation of quinine, putting elderly patients
at greater risk of adverse effects. Possible adverse effects include symptoms of cinchonism (tinnitus, headache,
nausea, rash, visual disturbance and temporary blindness), allergic reactions, and thrombocytopenia and haemolytic
anaemia.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wanwimolruk et al. (Ref. 11) found the elimination half-life of quinine to be 18.4 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1.6 hours in 12 subjects 20 to 35 years old. Furthermore, a significantly greater amount of quinine was excreted unchanged
in the elderly subjects, suggesting that quinine metabolism is reduced in elderly people. Overall, there was a 26-percent
reduction in clearance of quinine in the older group. The authors concluded that accumulation of quinine may occur
in elderly people, thus placing them at a greater risk of adverse events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These studies indicate that serious safety concerns exist with regard to the OTC availability of quinine sulfate
for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Subjects in all studies submitted were generally
in good health, with a mean age of 44 to 57 years in the various groups. However, the adverse reactions reported in these
studies suggest that quinine doses of 260 to 325 mg/day in healthy, middle-aged adults can produce symptoms of quinine
toxicity, including auditory, visual, and gastrointestinal effects. Some studies (Refs. 7, 8, and 9) suggest that
the vestibular, auditory, visual, and vascular effects of quinine can occur in healthy young adults at doses in and
below the range commonly employed for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Altered pharmacokinetics
with age also result in a longer half-life of quinine in older people. This longer half-life increases the frequency
and severity of adverse effects in the elderly (Ref. 11), a group in which leg cramps are a common condition (Refs. 12
and 13). Therefore, the agency concludes that quinine is not safe for OTC use in the treatment and/or prevention of
nocturnal leg muscle cramps.

7. One comment (Ref. 1) requested a ban on the OTC marketing of any quinine sulfate products used in the treatment of
nocturnal recumbency leg cramps. The comment based this request, in part, on adverse reactions reported to the FDA,
including eight deaths it described as closely linked to quinine products. The comment contended that serious and
fatal adverse reactions to quinine sulfate purchased OTC for this use continue to be reported. The comment mentioned
that these reactions can occur in several ways: (1) In persons hypersensitive to quinine, (2) from the innate toxicity
of quinine, or (3) as a result of interactions with other drugs, including digoxin, anticoagulants, and antiarrhythmics.
The comment concluded that the risks associated with quinine used for leg cramps are unacceptable in light of its lack
of efficacy for this use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that quinine has the potential to elicit serious hypersensitivity reactions at doses employed
in OTC drug products used for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The agency's spontaneous
adverse reaction reporting system includes reasonably unconfounded reports of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia,
leukopenia, granulocytopenia, anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity syndrome, severe skin reactions (including urticaria,
angioedema, and erythema multiforme), liver abnormalities, renal failure, and death (see section I.B., comment
4). Reports in the literature have identified quinine sulfate (in doses typically recommended for the treatment
and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps) as the causative agent in cases of photosensitive dermatitis (Refs.
2, 3, and 4), psychosis (Ref. 5), disseminated intravascular coagulation (Ref. 6), and hemolytic uremic syndrome
(Ref. 7).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that quinine may interact with several other drugs (Refs. 8, 9, and 10), including those mentioned
by the comment. This information could be included in the labeling of OTC quinine drug products. However, the agency
does not need to make a decision on such drug interaction precautions because no ingredients for treating and/or preventing
nocturnal leg muscle cramps are currently generally recognized as safe and effective for inclusion in an OTC drug
monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cinchonism is a cluster of symptoms of varying severity that includes: Tinnitus, dizziness, disorientation, nausea,
visual changes, auditory deficits, and (at higher doses) cardiac arrhythmias. Cinchonism is dose related. The clinical
studies discussed in section I.B., comment 6 demonstrate that adverse events typical of quinine toxicity (in some
cases, sufficiently severe to lead to discontinuation of the drug) occur in some people at doses generally recommended
for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. These studies indicate that some people who self-medicate
with quinine to treat and/or prevent nocturnal leg muscle cramps at doses recommended in product labeling will experience
these quinine-related adverse events. In addition, people taking quinine remain at risk of developing hypersensitivity
to the drug and experiencing a serious, life threatening, or fatal reaction as a consequence. Even if quinine were
effective for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, this risk would require that a prescribing
physician participate in the decision to use the drug, by assuring the diagnosis, considering alternative treatment
options, evaluating concurrent medical problems and medications, and monitoring patient safety throughout treatment.

8. Several comments downplayed the potential for hypersensitivity reactions to quinine, particularly quinine-
induced immunologic thrombocytopenia, arguing that the continued OTC marketing of quinine for the treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps should not be stopped because of this potential consequence of its use.
One comment (Ref. 1) submitted an expert review of drug-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia (DIITP), which stated
that DIITP has been reported with over 100 drugs. Gold salts, heparin, and the cinchona alkaloids are the drugs most
commonly associated with this condition. According to the expert review supplied by the comment, there is no known
information about the dose of quinine required to induce DIITP sensitivity. DIITP occurs more frequently in people
over 50 years old, possibly because of their greater exposure to drugs. It typically is characterized by a warm sensation,
followed by a chill. Bleeding episodes, manifested by petechiae (pinpoint red spots, caused by intradermal or submucosal
hemorrhage), purpura (purplish or brownish red discolorations visible through the skin, caused by hemorrhage into
the tissues), hemorrhagic lesions of the oral mucosa, and occasionally hemorrhage of the gastrointestinal and urinary
tracts may occur 6 to 12 hours after drug exposure in individuals who develop severe thrombocytopenia. Intracerebral
hemorrhage and lethal intrapulmonary hemorrhage have been reported. Primary treatment is to discontinue the offending
drug; bleeding usually subsides in 3 to 4 days. Other interventions (including glucocorticoid therapy and platelet
transfusions) have not been shown to be beneficial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment argued that many drugs and additives to foods have the propensity to induce a variety of adverse reactions
(Ref. 2). The comment stated that the prevalence of hypersensitivity to tartrazine (FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5), a widely
used dye, has been estimated to be about 1 in 10,000 in the general population. The comment pointed out that when tartrazine
is used in OTC drug products, a labeling statement is required to inform consumers that the product contains tartrazine
and that it may cause allergic-type reactions. The comment stated that this was ``a clear precedent for the OTC drug
use of products that have potential for rare hypersensitivity.'' The comment also described aspirin sensitivity
as widespread and emphasized that a brief warning statement in labeling regarding use by people with asthma or aspirin
sensitivity is deemed adequate to ensure safe OTC use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency finds that the information in the first comment indicates that quinine is one of the drugs most frequently
associated with DIITP. While other drugs (e.g., gold salts and heparin) cause DIITP, quinine is the only drug highly
associated with DIITP that is available OTC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1985, the Department of Health and Human Services established an Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on Hypersensitivity
to Food Constituents (the Committee) to evaluate data relevant to allergic-type reactions in humans that were associated
with food constituents. The Committee concluded that tartrazine may cause mild cases of urticaria (hives) in a small
subset of the population (usually not requiring medical intervention). The Committee found no evidence that the
color additive constitutes a hazard to the general public when used in food at its current levels. Prior to the Committee's
findings, the agency had decided that labeling provides an adequate safeguard for those sensitive to tartrazine.
(See the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 4, 1977 (42 FR 6835) and June 26, 1979 (44 FR 37212).) The agency requires the label of OTC and prescription
drug products containing tartrazine intended for oral, nasal, rectal, or vaginal use to specifically declare the
presence of tartrazine by listing the color additive using the names ``FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5'' and ``tartrazine.''
(See 21 CFR 74.1705(c)(2).) In addition to this label statement, prescription drug products for these uses must also
include in their labeling the warning statement ``This product contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which
may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall
incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen
in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a number of differences between hypersensitivity reactions to tartrazine and aspirin and hypersensitivity
reactions to quinine. In a review of allergic reactions to drug additives (Ref. 3), Simon stated that reactions to
tartrazine ``if they occur at all, are indeed quite rare for the asthmatic population, even for the aspirin-sensitive
subpopulation.'' Simon further reported that no positive responses were found after 125 double-blind, placebo-controlled
tartrazine challenges (with at least 25 mg) in an aspirin-sensitive asthmatic population. Simon also reviewed adverse
reactions to food additives (Ref. 4) and stated that, although tartrazine is the food additive most frequently associated
with hypersensitivity reactions, ``tartrazine has been confirmed to be at best only occasionally associated with
flares of urticaria or asthma.'' Reports of these relatively mild tartrazine reactions, however, are in contrast
to the serious reports for quinine, which involve life threatening and fatal hypersensitivity reactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virchow et al. (Ref. 5) evaluated sensitivity to tartrazine in 156 Europeans with confirmed aspirin-induced asthma.
Oral challenges were performed with increasing doses. All positive challenges were repeated under double-blind
conditions. Only four subjects had positive reactions; none were serious. The incidence of tartrazine cross sensitivity
to aspirin in this European population was 2.6 percent. In a similar study, Morales et al. (Ref. 6) conducted 141 challenge
tests on 47 subjects with asthma associated with intolerance to analgesics, using tartrazine doses of 5, 25, 50, 100,
and 200 mg and a placebo. Only five tests were positive in four of the subjects; repeat tests were negative in three of
the four subjects. The authors stated that clinical instability in these subjects may be the cause of some respiratory
symptoms attributed to tartrazine and that the practice of recommending color free diets should be reserved for cases
in which a positive challenge test has been obtained on at least two occasions. This experience suggests that: (1)
The incidence of tartrazine sensitivity may be overestimated, and (2) the nature of reactions to tartrazine is sufficiently
benign to permit multiple rechallenges to confirm intolerance. Rechallenge of quinine-sensitive individuals,
in contrast, is contraindicated because the reactions are serious, life threatening, or fatal, even under controlled
conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safford (Ref. 7) was unable to detect antibody formation with tartrazine and its metabolites in animal studies, suggesting
that an immunologic response is not involved in tartrazine sensitivity. Hypersensitivity to quinine, in contrast,
is mediated by an immunologic mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aspirin sensitivity is relatively common compared to quinine sensitivity, but is more manageable and usually predictable.
In a review of aspirin sensitivity, Settipane (Ref. 8) described a number of factors that are predictive of subjects
in whom intolerance is most likely to occur. Sensitivity is seen in 23 to 28 percent of people with chronic urticaria,
14 to 23 percent of people with nasal polyps, and up to 19 percent of people with asthma. These people are likely to be
under a doctor's care and to have been told to avoid aspirin products. Genton et al. (Ref. 9) studied the usefulness
of oral provocation tests to aspirin and food additives in 34 subjects with asthma or chronic urticaria, concluding
that such investigations are safe and useful in managing such subjects by identifying intolerance to various compounds.
As with tartrazine, hypersensitivity to aspirin does not appear to be mediated by an immunologic response (Ref. 8).
In contrast to aspirin, there are no predictive factors for quinine hypersensitivity and, as noted above, in vivo
rechallenge is contraindicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sensitivity to aspirin (Ref. 8) and tartrazine (Ref. 10) is a problem that is manageable. The sensitivity generally
results in urticarial or bronchospastic symptoms that are responsive to medical treatment. Anaphylaxis has been
reported with aspirin, but is extremely rare given the extensive use of products containing aspirin. In a retrospective
study of anaphylaxis occurring outside of hospitals in a hospital catchment area in Denmark over a 13-year period,
the rate of anaphylaxis caused by aspirin was 0.48 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (Ref. 11). Sensitivity to quinine,
in contrast to aspirin or tartrazine, affects a number of body systems and may be serious, manifested as urticaria/angioedema,
hepatic injury, renal failure, serious dermatologic conditions, serious hematologic events, and death (Ref. 12)
(also see section I.B., comment 6). Three sources estimate the incidence of quinine-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia
to be in the range of about 1:1,000 to 1:3,000 (see section I.B., comment 9).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's spontaneous reporting system contains 110 case reports involving quinine for the period from 1969 through
1990. Sixty-nine (approximately 63 percent) of these reports represent possible hypersensitivity reactions,
including 22 reports of thrombocytopenia (57 of these cases [approximately 83 percent] involved quinine products
and/or quinine dosages typically used in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps). Of the
eight deaths that occurred among the reported hypersensitivity reactions, medical records and autopsy findings
were sufficiently complete in two of these cases (both involving OTC quinine products indicated for the treatment
of leg muscle cramps) to implicate quinine-induced thrombocytopenia as precipitating fatal hemorrhages in each
case. Underreporting of such reactions into the agency's spontaneous reporting system is believed to be very substantial
for OTC drug products. This may be due to physicians (the principal reporters to the spontaneous reporting system)
not becoming aware of reactions to OTC drugs, and because manufacturers and distributors are not generally required
to transmit reports of serious adverse reactions involving OTC drugs to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concludes that the severity of quinine hypersensitivity reactions, even in their first occurrence, and
the inability to identify predisposing factors to this occurrence create a risk clearly different from that presented
by tartrazine or aspirin. The agency does not consider it likely that a warning statement in quinine product labeling
would be of significant value because it is impossible to prospectively identify the groups at risk (see section I.B.,
comment 10).

9. Two comments provided estimates of the incidence of quinine-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia (QIITP).
Lavy (Ref. 1) presented several estimates, each based on different assumptions and information. For one estimate,
Lavy noted that four of six hypersensitivity reactions reported to FDA in 1987 were cases of thrombocytopenia. Lavy
converted the total sales of quinine drug products for 1987 by dosage unit to ``total number of days of therapy sold''
by dividing the number of tablets and capsules sold by the dose per day described in product labeling. Lavy assumed
that quinine was taken for leg cramps approximately one quarter of the year by each subject. By dividing the ``total
days of therapy purchased'' by the ``total days used per person,'' Lavy estimated the size of the population exposed
to drug products containing quinine in 1987 to be 1.66 x 106, and calculated the incidence of QIITP to be 1 case per 415,000
people, based upon 4 cases reported to FDA that year. Lavy did not try to correct for underreporting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using another approach, Lavy reported that quinine has been estimated to be the causative agent in approximately
10 percent of all drug-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia reports. He noted that secondary thrombocytopenia
was the principal diagnosis in approximately 4,000 discharges in the 1987 National Hospital Discharge Survey. Assuming
that 10 percent of these thrombocytopenia cases were drug-induced and 10 percent of drug-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia
cases are related to quinine, 40 cases could be attributed to quinine. Assuming the population exposed to drug products
containing quinine in 1987 was 1.66 x 106 (as calculated above), Lavy calculated the incidence of QIITP to be 1:41,500.
Lavy cited a third estimate of the incidence of QIITP based on information from Danielsen's report on drug-induced
blood disorders among admissions at the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (Ref. 2). In this retrospective study,
6 cases of thrombocytopenia related to quinine or quinidine among 5,089 subjects were reported for an apparent incidence
of 1 case per 848 subjects taking 1 or the other of the 2 drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment (Ref. 3) estimated the incidence of QIITP from ingestion of drug products to be 1:3,300 per year. The
comment based its calculations on the number of cases of documented quinine-induced thrombocytopenia at the Blood
Center of Southeastern Wisconsin over a 10-year period. In making this estimate, it was assumed that at least half
of all cases occurring in this population would have been referred to the laboratory for confirmation of diagnosis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that the estimates of the incidence of thrombocytopenic reactions to drug products containing quinine
range from more than 1 in 1,000 (for quinine and quinidine considered together) to less than 1 in 400,000. This wide
range suggests that a precise estimate will be hard to obtain. It is difficult to conclude, however, that the first
estimate proposed by Lavy is correct. The number of events used by Lavy is the number reported to FDA in 1987. While no
one knows the extent of underreporting, it is believed to be very substantial. For example, if even a 1 percent rate
is assumed, this would translate, using Lavy's other figures, to about 1 in 4,000 people. The exposure estimate could
also be considerably in error. Lavy assumed the drug was used for one-quarter of the year by each person. If, in fact,
it was used for one half of the year, the number of exposed people would be half that proposed and the rate of drug-induced
immunologic thrombocytopenia would be double that calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incidence calculated based on the National Hospital Discharge Survey (Ref. 1) employed the estimate of population
discussed above and assumed 1 percent of the diagnoses of secondary thrombocytopenia were attributable to quinine.
There is no way to know the accuracy of this estimate; if it were higher, even by a factor of 5, the estimated rate would
be above 1 in 10,000, a substantial rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Probably the most credible of Lavy's estimates is the Puget Sound-based estimate (Ref. 2), because it is based on hospital
diagnoses and well-documented exposure. The estimate of the incidence of QIITP based on the number of documented
cases occurring in the population served by the Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin over a 10-year period (Ref.
3) also is based on relatively few assumptions and appears reliable. The only assumption in this calculation was that
twice as many events occurred as were reported to the laboratory. The estimates from these two sources, 1:848 (Puget
Sound) and 1:3,300 (Southeastern Wisconsin) are similar to the estimate of 1:1,000 cited by Mitchell (Ref. 4). These
three sources provide a reasonably small range for the incidence of QIITP that can be expected, about 1:1,000 to 1:3,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, while the agency believes that a precise estimate of the incidence of QIITP will be difficult to obtain,
credible estimates from three sources (Refs. 2, 3, and 4) do not support the assertion that QIITP is a rare event.

10. Three comments contended that warnings in product labeling could adequately inform and protect consumers from
the well-known side effects of quinine, including idiosyncratic reactions. One comment stated that warnings recommended
by the Miscellaneous Internal Panel (47 FR 43562 at 43564), including those concerning idiosyncratic reactions,
have been incorporated into the labeling of currently marketed products. Another comment stated that careful warning
language in its product labeling helps to further protect consumers by informing them of the possibility of untoward,
idiosyncratic reactions. This labeling states: ``Discontinue use and consult your doctor immediately if swelling,
bruising, skin rash, skin discoloration or bleeding occurs. These symptoms may indicate a serious condition. Discontinue
use if ringing in the ears, deafness, diarrhea, nausea or visual disturbances occur * * * Do not take if * * * allergic
or sensitive to quinine or under 12 years of age.'' A third comment, citing a report by Lavy (Ref. 1), stated that serious
adverse effects occur at a frequency probably less than 1 in 40,000 people (see section I.A., comment 9), the clinical
course is only rarely complicated, and that labeling can clearly and concisely warn ``* * * regarding the more common
yet low frequency side effects, which are generally treated simply by discontinuing use.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph (50 FR 46588 at 46592) the agency proposed the following warning in &sect;343.150(c)
for OTC drug products containing quinine: ``Discontinue use if ringing in the ears, deafness, skin rash, or visual
disturbances occur. Do not take if pregnant, sensitive to quinine, or under 12 years of age.'' The agency proposed
this labeling in the event that data were submitted that resulted in the inclusion of quinine in a monograph in the final
rule. While proposed, this labeling was not required at that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the warning information currently appearing on OTC quinine products marketed for the treatment
and/or prevention of leg muscle cramps. The language varies slightly between products, but the information provided
is similar. In general, labeling warns patients to discontinue taking the drug should any of a number of listed events
occur. However, the labeling differs in the events listed and in recommending when a physician should be contacted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several factors that argue against the sufficiency of label warnings to protect consumers from serious
adverse events related to quinine. The frequency of these reactions is probably greater than assumed by the comments
(see section I.B., comment 9). Many of the adverse advents are unpredictable. For example, thrombocytopenia may
occur after 1 week of exposure or after months or years of quinine administration. Further, there may be no characteristic
that would predict an adverse event in the person using the product. The agency believes that a physician could help
people using this drug appreciate the nature and frequency of the risk and help in the consideration whether that risk
is acceptable. The physician could also advise about the signs of thrombocytopenia, such as petechiae (pinpoint,
nonraised, round, purplish red spots) and purpura (small hemorrhage), perhaps allowing identification of this
condition before a significant hemorrhage occurred. A number of the adverse reaction reports note the occurrence
of a similar prior event related to previous ingestion of quinine in which neither the user nor the physician recognized
the relationship of the illness to quinine ingestion. Use of quinine under a physician's prescription, with appropriate
emphasis on warning signs, may make timely recognition easier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although drug-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia may be the best studied idiosyncratic reaction caused by quinine
(Ref. 2), quinine has also been reported to have been associated with a number of other hypersensitivity reactions
and pharmacologic effects. Lavy (Ref. 1) notes that these include ``the possibility of decreased digoxin clearance,
increased half-life of quinine when given concurrently with cimetidine, pseudo-allergic reactions in aspirin-sensitive
patients, drug fever, nonspecific granulomatous hepatitis, asthma, hemolytic anemia, inhibition of tolbutamide
metabolism, hypoprothrombinemia, hemolytic anemia in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G&hyph;6&hyph;PD)
deficient patients, etc.'' Cooper and Bunn (Ref. 3) reported that G-6-PD-deficient individuals (i.e., those variants
susceptible to hemolytic anemia from quinine) are relatively common among eastern Mediterranean and Chinese people.
Quinine may also interact with several other drugs (see section I.B., comment 7). Furthermore, the possible pharmacologic
effects may have particular significance for the elderly who may be taking concomitant medications that either provoke
muscle cramps or adversely interact with quinine. Altered pharmacokinetics with age also result in a longer half-life
of quinine in older people, which suggests that the frequency and severity of adverse effects may be greater in the
elderly (Ref. 4) (also see section I.B., comment 6). The foregoing possible additional adverse reactions, including
those related to ethnicity, age, and concurrent drug therapy, are not addressed by the labeling of the comment's product
and would generally be difficult to address in OTC drug product labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that the number of reports of serious adverse reactions submitted to FDA's spontaneous reporting
system, including those resulting in hospitalization and death, has been increasing over the past several years
in spite of the industry's revision of labeling to incorporate the warnings suggested by the Miscellaneous Internal
Panel in 1982. There has been an increasing number of reports per year since 1986, and 56 of 105 reports (approximately
53 percent) have been received by FDA since 1988. (See section I.B., comment 4.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concludes there is insufficient evidence that warnings in product labeling could adequately inform and
protect consumers from the well-known side effects of quinine, including idiosyncratic reactions. This conclusion
is based primarily on the severity of hypersensitivity reactions to drug products that contain quinine and the inability
to identify predisposing factors to these reactions, the frequency of such reactions, and the relationship of quinine-related
adverse events to factors such as ethnicity, age, and concurrent drug therapy.

11. Two comments objected to the agency's discussion on the safety of vitamin E (50 FR 46588 at 46591), contending that
a considerable body of data demonstrating safety in humans had been excluded from the agency's evaluation. The comments
primarily objected to the agency's emphasis on the observations of one physician as an expert on vitamin E because
they considered the data referred to by this individual to be anecdotal, uncontrolled, and largely subjective. The
comments provided a literature review and other data (Refs. 1, 2, and 3) to support the safe use of vitamin E in humans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment disagreed with the agency's Category III classification of vitamin E both individually and in combination
with quinine sulfate for the treatment and prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, contending that adequate information
already existed to support the safety of these ingredients (alone or in combination). The comment included the results
of two new clinical studies (Refs. 4 and 5) comparing vitamin E, quinine sulfate, a combination product containing
vitamin E and quinine sulfate, and placebo to support the safe use of the individual ingredients as well as the combination
of these ingredients for this indication. In both studies, subjects received a daily dose of 1,600 I.U. of vitamin
E, either alone or in combination with quinine sulfate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One additional comment included the results of a third new clinical study comparing vitamin E, quinine sulfate, a
combination product containing vitamin E and quinine sulfate, and placebo (Ref. 6). Some safety information on vitamin
E can be derived from this study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph, the agency classified vitamin E in Category III for the treatment and prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, stating that a safe and effective OTC dosage had not been established for this use (50
FR 46588 at 46591). The agency evaluated all of the data that had been submitted to this rulemaking proceeding but acknowledges
that these data were not the total body of information that has been published on vitamin E. The agency did point out
that the paper by Roberts (Ref. 7) raised some questions about a safe dose of OTC vitamin E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the additional data and information that have been submitted and determined that sufficient
evidence has been presented to support the safety of vitamin E for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg
muscle cramps. However, the evidence is inadequate to support the effectiveness of vitamin E for this use (see section
I.C., comment 13).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Farrell and Bieri (Ref. 2) evaluated potential toxic and/or beneficial effects of vitamin E intake. Twenty-eight
adults who had been self-administering 100 to 800 I.U. of vitamin E daily for an average of 3 years were studied. A review
of the subjects' past medical histories did not reveal any apparent gross evidence of toxicity from vitamin E intake.
The highest plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations in the vitamin E subjects were two times the upper limit of normal,
as determined in control subjects. A broad range of laboratory tests were performed to assess toxic effects on various
organ systems. No disturbance in liver, kidney, muscle, thyroid gland, erythrocytes, leukocytes, coagulation
parameters, or blood glucose was found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Salkeld (Ref. 1) reviewed over 9,000 cases in which daily doses of up to 3,000 I.U. of vitamin E were taken for up to 11
years (and 55,000 I.U. daily for 5 months in a few subjects). In 1,014 cases with vitamin E intake from 200 I.U. up to 3,000
I.U. daily for up to 11 years, it was stated that no side effects were observed. In another 8,241 cases with similar intake
and duration, there was no mention of side effects. In other trials, 82 of 813 subjects complained of one or more side
effects. The reported effects included dermatitis, pruritus ani, acne, cheilosis, fatigue and weakness, gastrointestinal
symptoms, prostatic obstruction, tachycardia, and vasodilation. Thus, in a total of 10,068 cases, Salkeld found
a 0.8 percent overall incidence of side effects. The Advisory Review Panel on OTC Vitamin, Mineral, and Hematinic
Drug Products relied in part on this same literature review by Salkeld in stating its conclusion ``that vitamin E is
safe'' (March 16, 1979, 44 FR 16126 at 16172). The Advisory Review Panel on OTC Antimicrobial (II) Drug Products, in
the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC topical acne drug products (March 23, 1982, 47 FR 12430), mentioned
that there are no notable pharmacological or toxicological effects of oral vitamin E and that numerous experiments
indicate that high dietary intakes of vitamin E (up to 800 I.U. daily for up to 3 years) are apparently without toxic
side effects (47 FR 12462).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the new clinical studies submitted includes the results of laboratory tests performed in 24 patients to evaluate
the effect of the product on various organ systems (Ref. 4). Tests were performed at baseline and at the end of each 1-week
treatment period. No abnormal results in liver, kidney, leukocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, electrolytes, or
blood glucose were found in any of the patients at any time. In this study vitamin E was used only in a combination product,
and each subject had a daily intake of 1,600 I.U. of vitamin E. However, the combination product was only taken during
1 week of the study. Therefore, the laboratory data do not provide any useful information on the long-term effects
of vitamin E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second new clinical study (Ref. 5) was a four-period crossover study in which each subject received 1,600 I.U.
of vitamin E daily (either singly or in a combination product) for 5 days during two of the four treatment periods of
the study. Although no laboratory tests were performed, the subjects were asked to report any adverse reactions at
the end of each treatment period. Twenty-seven adverse reactions were reported by 19 subjects out of 205 individuals
completing all phases of the study. Six of these adverse reactions were from subjects who received vitamin E singly.
Complaints included: Abdominal cramps, nausea, loose bowels, and headache. The most commonly occurring complaint
was gastrointestinal disturbance (nausea, flatulence, or diarrhea) of a transient nature. These reactions are
consistent with those previously reported in other studies; however, the investigators considered the reactions
as not related or probably not related to the study drug.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the third new clinical study (Ref. 6), vitamin E (1,600 I.U. daily for 2 weeks) was compared with placebo, quinine
sulfate, and a combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle
cramps. Details of this multicenter, parallel-design study are described in section I.C., comment 12. Vitamin E
alone was administered to 137 subjects. Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event, occurring in 23
subjects (16.8 percent). However, a similar rate of headache (21 percent) was reported in subjects taking placebo.
The investigators described only six of these events as possibly related to the study medication. Other adverse events
described by the investigators as possibly related to vitamin E included three of four reports of nausea, two of three
reports of myalgia, and one of three reports of local edema. Thus, daily doses of 1,600 I.U. of vitamin E were well tolerated
in this study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bendich and Machlin (Ref. 8) reviewed six double-blind studies involving vitamin E at doses as high as 3,200 I.U. daily
for up to 6 months. Very few adverse effects were noted, and no specific side effect was consistently observed in all
the studies. In one study, 202 college students received 600 I.U. of vitamin E or placebo daily for 28 days in a randomized,
double-blind trial (Ref. 9). No effects on prothrombin time, total blood leukocyte count, or serum creatine phosphokinase
activity were evident. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 30 healthy adults were given 800
I.U. of vitamin E or placebo daily for 16 weeks. There were no significant differences in effects on plasma lipids between
the vitamin E and placebo groups (Ref. 10). No side effects were observed in a double-blind, crossover study of 48 subjects
who received 1,600 I.U. of vitamin E or placebo daily for a period of 6 months (Ref. 11). There were no reports of significant
side effects, weakness, fatigue, or thrombophlebitis in a double-blind, crossover study in which 2,000 I.U. of vitamin
E or placebo was given daily to 25 adult onset-diabetic subjects for a period of 6 weeks (Ref. 12). Thyroid hormone levels
were found to be identical for both the treatment and placebo periods. Hale et al. (Ref. 13) examined the incidence
of various clinical disorders and measured a number of laboratory variables in 369 subjects who used vitamin E supplements
and 1,861 subjects who did not. All subjects were over age 65. Use of vitamin E appeared to have little influence on clinical
disorders or hematologic or biochemical parameters. Only the serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was higher
in vitamin E users. However, the values were still within the accepted normal range. There were no significant differences
between users and nonusers in the prevalence of hypertension, vaginal bleeding, frequent headache, dizziness,
recurrent diarrhea, diabetus mellitus, lightheaded-ness, or thyroid disorders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roberts (Ref. 7) raised concerns about an increased incidence of thrombophlebitis associated with excessive vitamin
E intake. In over 10 years of practice, Roberts encountered more than 80 patients with problems that he attributed
to self-medication with high doses of vitamin E (greater than 800 I.U. daily). He suggested that vitamin E may encourage
thrombosis in patients with a predisposing condition. Symptoms of thrombophlebitis were said to have abated upon
cessation of vitamin E therapy. Conventional treatment for thrombophlebitis (e.g., bed rest, local heat) was administered
along with the discontinuation of vitamin E therapy. Thus, it is difficult to assess which action was responsible
for the improvement. In addition, no controlled studies or concurrent references were included in support of his
conclusions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fitzgerald and Brash (Ref. 14) stated that vitamin E at 1,600 I.U. a day in humans decreases platelet thromboxane production
which could consequently reduce the potential for thrombosis formation. In addition, they noted that associations
between thrombophlebitis and vitamin E use have not been reported by other authors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several authors (Refs. 2, 9, and 15) have reported that oral intake of high doses of vitamin E has not produced blood
coagulation abnormalities in normal humans. However, in individuals deficient in vitamin K (caused by malabsorption,
diet, or anticoagulant therapy), large doses of vitamin E can exacerbate coagulation defects. Therefore, high levels
of supplemental vitamin E may be contraindicated in such conditions (Ref. 8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the discussion above, the agency concludes that sufficient evidence exists to support the safety of vitamin
E at the daily doses that have been commonly used for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.

C. Comments on the Effectiveness of Nocturnal Leg Muscle Cramp Ingredients
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. One comment disagreed with the agency's Category III classification of quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps on the basis of a lack of adequate clinical data demonstrating the effectiveness
of quinine sulfate for this indication (50 FR 46588 at 46590). The comment contended that there is sufficient evidence
of quinine's effectiveness for this indication at present to warrant classifying it in Category I. The comment subsequently
submitted the results of two clinical studies (Refs. 1 and 2) comparing quinine sulfate, vitamin E, a combination
product containing quinine sulfate and vitamin E, and placebo for the treatment and prevention of nocturnal leg muscle
cramps to support the effectiveness of the individual ingredients (quinine sulfate and vitamin E) as well as the combination
of these ingredients for this indication. Another comment provided the results of three clinical studies (Refs.
3, 4, and 5) that it felt addressed the effectiveness issues raised by the agency in the tentative final monograph (50
FR 46590). This comment requested an oral hearing if the submitted data were not found adequate to upgrade quinine
sulfate to Category I. In addition, in response to a citizen petition, one comment included the results of a clinical
study intended to demonstrate the efficacy of a combination product containing quinine sulfate and vitamin E (Ref.
6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph, the agency concluded, on the basis of its review of the new data submitted and the
studies and information discussed by the Internal Analgesic and Miscellaneous Internal Panels, that quinine sulfate
for use in OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps should be classified
in Category III. The agency stated that adequate clinical data are necessary to support the reclassification of quinine
from Category III to Category I and that any such studies should address the following safety and effectiveness issues
(50 FR 46588 at 46590):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is quinine effective in treating and/or preventing nocturnal leg muscle cramps in low daily doses (e.g., 200 to
325 mg) over short periods of time (e.g., 7 days or less)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If short-term quinine treatment with low doses is not significantly effective in reducing recurrent episodes
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, must such medication be taken over extended periods of time to obtain relief? If yes,
how long a period of time?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) What adverse effects are experienced by subjects exposed to effective doses of quinine over an effective course
of therapy?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the additional clinical data that have been submitted and determined that they are not adequate
to support the reclassification of quinine sulfate to Category I for this use. Three studies (Refs. 3, 4, and 5) compared
quinine to placebo. In one study (Ref. 3), 75 subjects were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
crossover study that was conducted over a 10-week period in five 2-week intervals. Subjects with a history of at least
two cramps per week for at least 3 months were included in this study and randomized to one of two treatment groups (group
I or II). The initial 2-week period was a baseline period and patients who failed to have at least two cramps per week
were dropped from the study. Subjects who had a sufficient number of cramps during the baseline period were either
given the placebo (group I) or 325 mg of quinine sulfate per night (group II) for a period of 2 weeks. No treatment was
given for the next 2-week period and in the fourth 2-week period subjects crossed over to the alternate treatment.
A final 2-week period of no treatment followed. Subjects were issued weekly case report forms upon which they were
instructed to record the number of cramps experienced per night, the time of the cramp, and the severity of the cramp.
Subjects were also asked to rate the effectiveness of the medication just completed at weeks 4 and 8 of the study. According
to the protocol, subjects were assigned to the treatment sequence, on the basis of a predetermined randomization
schedule, prior to entering the baseline period. Therefore, the removal of subjects from the study in the first 2 weeks
for not having enough events may have biased the study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the statistical analysis of the study data, three efficacy variables were evaluated: The mean frequency of leg
cramps (per night), the mean severity of leg cramps per night, and the total number of nights per week that leg cramps
occurred. The last variable (total number of nights per week that leg cramps occurred) appears to be constructed from
the primary data because no such variable is listed on the weekly case report forms from which these variables are derived.
The subjects' overall assessment of the effectiveness of the drug was collected but not analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixty-two of the 75 subjects enrolled in the study were included in the data analysis. Of the 13 subjects found to be
unevaluable, 8 withdrew from the study on their own accord. No specific reasons for these withdrawals were given,
but it is stated in the study report that they were unrelated to the treatment. The remaining five subjects were dropped
for various medical reasons and noncompliance with the protocol. No ``intent-to-treat'' analysis was performed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of analyses were carried out. Two of the analyses treated the unblinded baseline and washout periods as if
they were treatment periods. This type of analysis is incorrect for a crossover trial. The relevant comparisons that
should be made are between the treatments in the double-blind periods, possibly with adjustments for baseline, provided
there are no major changes in baseline values for each period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When Patel's joint test for equal carryover and equal pretreatment severity (Ref. 7) is applied to the data, however,
significant differences are seen in pretreatment severity before the second period. Analysis of the second period
is thus compromised; therefore, analysis should be limited to the first treatment period (weeks 3 and 4). This comparison
does not show a significant advantage for quinine sulfate over placebo for any of the effectiveness variables.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another clinical study (Ref. 4) used the same study design as the study discussed above except that the dose of quinine
sulfate was 260 mg/night, not the 325 mg/night used in the first study. In addition, five efficacy variables were analyzed:
Frequency, severity, and duration of leg cramps, and induction and quality of sleep. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the predetermined randomization chart submitted for this study provided for enrollment of 74 subjects,
84 subjects entered the study. No explanation for entry of the additional 10 subjects was provided. As in the first
study, randomization to treatment sequence occurred at the time of entry into the baseline period; thus, subsequent
removal of subjects prior to the first double-blind treatment period may also have introduced bias into this study.
Of the 84 subjects entered at baseline, 69 (34 assigned to group I and 35 to group II) entered the double- blind treatment
phase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study concluded that significant differences at the 5-percent level exist between quinine sulfate and placebo
for three of the five variables: Frequency of cramps, induction of sleep, and quality of sleep. However, no documentation
of any statistical analysis supporting these claims was provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statistical report that accompanied the study addressed the question of comparing the effectiveness of quinine
sulfate and placebo with a multivariate analysis of covariance which compared the vector of efficacy variables over
four observation periods (two treatment periods plus two washout periods with the initial baseline value as a covariate).
The conclusion of the analysis was that the treatment effect was not significant (p = 0.106). Univariate analyses
of covariance comparing these four observation periods were referred to in the statistical report, but no p-values
for treatment effect were provided (although a significant order by treatment interaction was reported). Also included
in the statistical analyses of the study were comparisons of the four observation periods separately by sequence
(quinine sulfate-placebo and placebo-quinine sulfate), which included baseline-adjusted means and comparisons
between periods using Duncan's Multiple Range Test. These comparisons showed that significant differences were
demonstrated between quinine and placebo only for the placebo-quinine sulfate sequence (group II), and only for
three variables: Frequency of cramps, quality of sleep, and induction of sleep. However, the adjusted means for the
quinine sulfate-placebo sequence (group I) favored placebo over quinine sulfate for all five efficacy variables.
In addition, as for the first study, the appropriate statistical analysis for this type of study was not done. The hypothesis
of equal carryover effect was not tested and not rejected before any of the other statistical tests for treatment effect
were performed. The results of this study are not adequate to support the effectiveness of quinine sulfate for the
treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study by Jones and Castleden (Ref. 5) also does not provide adequate evidence of quinine sulfate's effectiveness
for this indication. The study was a double-blind crossover study of nine patients with four 2-week periods of observation
(a run-in period and a washout period in addition to two treatment periods of placebo or quinine sulfate 300 mg/day).
The same five efficacy values as in the second study above were evaluated: Frequency, severity, and duration of leg
cramps, and induction and quality of sleep. No raw data were included to substantiate any of the statistical claims
made by the authors; nor was a protocol included in the article.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the five primary efficacy variables, only severity of cramps was claimed to show a significant difference between
quinine sulfate and placebo (p &lt; 0.025), although an analysis of frequency of cramps after 2 a.m. was also claimed
to be significant (p &lt; 0.025). There was no indication that the time period after 2 a.m. was identified in the protocol
as defining a primary endpoint; thus, this is assumed to be a post-hoc analysis done after reviewing the data. In general,
the isolated severity finding is not convincing on its face. In addition, the published article did not provide sufficient
information to permit an independent analysis of the data. For these reasons, the study does not provide evidence
that quinine sulfate is an effective treatment for nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three studies (Refs. 1, 2, and 6) were submitted to support the effectiveness of quinine sulfate and vitamin E individually
and in combination for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The Freiburg study (Ref. 1)
was a 5-week, double-blind, randomized, crossover study in 24 subjects. All subjects received placebo during week
1 (baseline), week 3, and week 5. Subjects in group I received quinine in week 2 and the combination of quinine and vitamin
E in week 4, while subjects in group II were given the combination product in week 2 and quinine in week 4. A statistically
significant difference in frequency of attacks between the combination product and quinine sulfate was reported,
but no difference in duration or severity of attack was found between these two active treatments. The report described
an ``obvious'' improvement in frequency, duration, and severity of attacks between the placebo periods and both
active treatments, but no statistical evidence or analysis to support this conclusion was provided. Moreover, the
comparison of treatments and placebo did not involve randomized patient groups, nor was it blinded. Only the portion
of the study comparing the combination product versus quinine was a randomized, double-blind trial. The study report
did not include the study protocol, details of the statistical analysis conducted, or individual subject data. The
model described in the summary of the data analysis did not properly separate carryover effect from treatment effect.
The study provides no evidence from a controlled trial that quinine is effective for nocturnal leg muscle cramps.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other study (Ref. 2) also employed a complicated randomized, four-period, crossover design. There were 205 subjects
randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: Quinine sulfate 260 mg/day, vitamin E 1,600 I.U./day, a combination
of quinine and vitamin E, or placebo. The combination of quinine and vitamin E was reported as being statistically
superior to both its components and placebo for six variables: Effect of cramps on falling asleep, nighttime awakening
due to cramps, number of cramps, severity of cramps, subject global evaluation, and difficulty falling asleep due
to cramps. The study also reported statistically significant positive findings on quinine sulfate versus placebo
for the first five of these six variables. As in the Freiburg study, the model used in the statistical analysis does
not properly separate the carryover effect from the treatment effect. Neither the data listings nor the results by
period were provided. Therefore, the agency was unable to independently analyze the results of this study or to rely
on the analysis provided as evidence that the reported results were attributable to drug treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third clinical study compared quinine sulfate, vitamin E, and a combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E to
placebo, for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps (Ref. 6). This study was a multicenter,
randomized, block parallel-design with a single-blind, placebo, run-in period, followed by a 2-week, double-blind,
randomized, treatment phase. Subjects who had at least one leg cramp per night for a minimum of 3 nights during the single-blind
placebo week, and met all other selection criteria, were randomly assigned to one of the four double-blind treatment
groups. Capsules, identical in appearance, contained either placebo, quinine sulfate 64.8 mg, vitamin E 400 I.U.,
or a combination of quinine sulfate 64.8 mg and vitamin E 400 I.U. Subjects were instructed to take two capsules following
their evening meal, and two capsules before bedtime, which provided daily doses of 259.2 mg of quinine sulfate, 1,600
I.U. of vitamin E, or the combination thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Efficacy endpoints identified in the protocol were: (1) Number of episodes of nocturnal leg cramps per week, (2) sleep
disturbance due to nocturnal leg cramps, (3) severity of nocturnal leg cramps, and (4) duration of nocturnal leg cramps.
However, none of the parameters was designated as a primary efficacy variable in the protocol. The protocol specified
that efficacy would be analyzed by analysis of variance with repeated measures test, as well as other methods deemed
appropriate. On the basis of an estimated 30 percent difference between the combination product and its components,
assuming an alpha of 0.05 and statistical power of 70 percent, a sample size of 972 evaluable subjects was planned (243
subjects/group). Enrollment was suspended, however, and the data were analyzed after 498 evaluable subjects (51
percent) completed the study. Subjects were approximately evenly distributed among treatment groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final report, results were separately analyzed for weeks 1 and 2 of the double-blind treatment. The change from
baseline scores obtained during the single-blind, placebo week was analyzed on seven variables for each of the treatment
groups at days 7 and 14 using a two-way analysis of variance test with terms for treatment, center, and treatment by
center interaction. The data were not analyzed using the analysis of variance with repeated measures test, as prospectively
stated in the protocol. The variables were: (1) Number of nights per week with leg cramps, (2) average number of leg
cramps per night, (3) average severity of leg cramps per night, (4) average duration of leg cramps per night, (5) average
number of leg cramps per night with sleeping difficulty, (6) average degree of difficulty getting to sleep per night,
and (7) average number of nights per week awakened by leg cramps. The placebo group was compared with the remaining
treatment groups with the least-significant-difference test using error mean square from the analysis of variance
table. Within each treatment group, the amount of change from baseline for each efficacy parameter was compared for
each double-blind treatment week using the Wilcoxon sign rank test. P-values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically
significant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twelve centers initially participated in the study. Three centers were terminated because of low enrollment (less
than four evaluable subjects in at least one treatment group). These low enrollment centers were combined in the analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final report, the number of nights per week with leg cramps was declared the primary efficacy variable. During
the baseline period, a mean of approximately 5 nights per week with leg cramps was recorded in all groups (placebo 4.72,
combination 4.95, quinine sulfate 5.04, vitamin E 4.98). All groups improved during week 1 with a reduction in frequency
to approximately 4 nights per week with cramps (placebo 4.04, combination 3.73, quinine sulfate 3.53, vitamin E 3.97).
The greatest reductions were in subjects given quinine sulfate and the combination product and the difference in
week 1 was found to be statistically significant compared to placebo for these treatment groups (p less than or equal
to 0.04). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statistically significant differences between quinine sulfate and placebo were reported in the first week of the
study for four of the six remaining efficacy variables declared to be secondary parameters in the final report. Quinine
was reported to be significantly better than placebo in reducing the average number of leg cramps per night, average
severity of leg cramps per night, average duration of leg cramps per night, and average number of nights per week with
sleeping difficulty. No statistically significant differences between any of the treatment groups for any variable
were reported for the second week of the study. The comment concluded that quinine sulfate, alone and in combination
with vitamin E, at a daily dose of approximately 260 mg was safe and effective in the short term (1-week) treatment of
nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency finds that there were a number of flaws in the analysis of this study. First, the primary endpoint (number
of nights per week with leg cramps) appears to have been arbitrarily chosen after the study was completed. None of the
efficacy variables was declared the primary endpoint in the protocol. Second, the study was of 2 week's duration,
and there was no provision in the protocol for separate evaluation of the data from week 1 and week 2. Thus, there is no
basis for the decision to analyze week 1 and week 2 separately in the absence of such an analysis declared prospectively
in the protocol. In fact, an analysis of both weeks together (see below) does not show a significant benefit of quinine.
Third, an adjustment for multiple comparisons should have been included in the data analysis. Given seven variables,
two active treatments, and at least three time points at which data could be analyzed (first week, second week, both
weeks), the nominally significant differences between treatments at the end of week one would not be expected to retain
statistical significance if an adjustment for multiple comparisons were included in the analysis. Even considering
the retrospectively identified primary endpoint, a correction for three ``looks'' (week 1, week 2, and together)
would at least double the nominal p-value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even without correction for multiplicity, the results do not support the conclusion that quinine sulfate and vitamin
E, alone or in combination, are effective for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. First,
week 2 results fail to replicate the results of week 1. No differences between any of the treatment groups for any parameter
were found at the end of week 2, nor was the investigators' global assessment, conducted at the end of the 2-week double-blind
period, able to differentiate between treatments. Second, a significant treatment by center interaction was found
for the reported superiority of quinine sulfate over placebo in week 1 in reducing the number of nights per week with
leg cramps. The result was driven by two of nine centers. In one of these centers, the combination product was indistinguishable
from placebo, and in the other, the superiority of placebo over the combination neared statistical significance
(p = 0.10). Thus, in the two clinics responsible for the favorable week 1 results of treatment with quinine, there was
a failure to replicate the result reported with quinine sulfate alone. Vitamin E was ineffective in all parameters
measured throughout the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The four retrospectively-declared secondary endpoints for which statistically significant reductions were reported
in week 1 in the quinine sulfate group compared to placebo were: (1) The number of cramps per night, (2) the number of
nights with sleeping difficulty, (3) the severity of the cramps, and (4) the duration of the cramps. Although a consistent
benefit on these endpoints would render a finding on the primary endpoint more persuasive, as with the primary efficacy
endpoint, none of the differences between active treatment and placebo persisted through to the end of week 2. For
the reasons discussed above, the post hoc, week-1 analysis of these endpoints fails to provide convincing evidence
to support the efficacy of quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two additional analyses of the results of the study were submitted (Refs. 8 and 9). The first (Ref. 8) was an analysis
of the number of leg cramps per day for each day of the study. This analysis showed occasional days in which quinine was
superior to placebo, but is on the whole not helpful. Given an entry cramp rate of one cramp episode per night for at least
3 nights per week, significant differences in any endpoint would not be expected on a day-by-day (i.e., noncumulative)
evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second analysis (Ref. 9) was of the total cramp rate (mean number of cramps per day over the course of the entire study
period) for both the evaluable subset of subjects and the intent-to-treat population. Two analyses were performed
on each group. In one analysis, only those subjects who completed the study with at least 14 days of treatment (the completer
analysis) were analyzed, while the other analysis involved the results from all subjects with efficacy observations
(the endpoint analysis) for the quinine sulfate and placebo treatment groups. In the endpoint analyses, where less
than 14 days of treatment was completed, leg cramps for the observed number of days were calculated, and the mean was
carried forward to 14 days. None of the four analyses revealed statistically significant reductions in the mean number
of leg cramps experienced during 14 days of treatment in the quinine-treated subjects compared with placebo subjects.
The endpoint analysis for evaluable patients approached statistical significance for quinine sulfate (p = 0.06),
but the results of the completer analysis for evaluable subjects and both intent-to-treat analyses were clearly
negative. The total cramp rate over the entire study is the most straightforward effectiveness measure; it did not
show a drug effect on cramps. While the favorable trend on one analysis could suggest activity, the study was already
of very substantial size and should have been able to detect a clinically meaningful response. This study, therefore,
does not provide evidence of efficacy of quinine sulfate, vitamin E, or the combination thereof in the treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussion, the agency concludes that the submitted data are inadequate to establish the effectiveness
of quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Further, the agency concludes
that the submitted data do not adequately address the safety and effectiveness issues raised by the agency in the tentative
final monograph (see discussion above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional agency comments and evaluations of the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 10, 11,
and 12).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commissioner has determined that there are not reasonable grounds in support of a hearing and that a hearing on
this issue is not warranted. Six clinical trials have been submitted and have failed to establish the safety and efficacy
of quinine sulfate in treating and/or preventing nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Occasional significant differences
favoring quinine were not replicated within or between studies. In two crossover design studies (Refs. 3 and 4), appropriate
analyses revealed no significant differences between quinine sulfate and placebo. The results of a very large parallel-design,
2-week study showed no significant effect in an analysis of the 2-week data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, deficiencies in the studies themselves render the reported results unreliable. Each of these studies
involved multiple endpoints, none of which was prospectively declared as the primary efficacy variable(s) in any
of the studies. There was no attempt to correct significance levels for multiple endpoints. The design of one study
did not permit the independent evaluation of the efficacy of quinine sulfate alone (Ref. 1). In three crossover studies
(Refs. 2, 3, and 4), the treatment effect was confounded by potential carryover effect and baseline differences.
The 2-week, parallel-design study (Ref. 6) showed no effect overall for the entire treatment period, including the
investigator's global assessment. Only by considering the results of week 1 separately, an unplanned analysis,
was any significant difference between quinine and placebo found in this study, and this finding was confounded by
a significant treatment-by-center interaction. For these reasons, the studies cannot be considered adequate and
well-controlled clinical investigations as required under &sect;330.10(a)(4)(ii). The Commissioner concludes
that a hearing on this issue is not justified for the reasons stated above.

13. One comment disagreed with the agency's Category III classification of vitamin E for the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps on the basis of a lack of adequate clinical data demonstrating the effectiveness of
vitamin E for this indication (50 FR 46588 at 46591). The comment contended that there is sufficient evidence of vitamin
E's effectiveness for this indication at present to warrant classifying it in Category I. The comment subsequently
submitted the results of two clinical studies (Refs. 1 and 2) comparing vitamin E, quinine sulfate, a combination
product containing vitamin E and quinine sulfate, and placebo for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg
muscle cramps to support the effectiveness of the individual ingredients (vitamin E and quinine sulfate) as well
as the combination of these ingredients for this indication. In addition, in responding to a citizen petition, one
comment included a clinical study comparing vitamin E, quinine sulfate, a combination product containing both ingredients,
and placebo (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph, the agency concluded that there was a lack of controlled studies demonstrating
the effectiveness of vitamin E in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The agency also
determined that a safe and effective OTC dosage of vitamin E had not been established (50 FR 46588 at 46591). Therefore,
the agency classified vitamin E in Category III for this use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the additional clinical data that have been submitted and determined that they are not adequate
to support the reclassification of vitamin E to Category I for this use. In one double-blind, randomized, crossover
study (Ref. 1), a combination product containing 64.8 mg quinine sulfate and 400 I.U. of vitamin E in a lecithin base
was compared to 64.8 mg of quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps in subjects
with a history of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Subjects were randomized into two groups. All subjects took placebo
during week 1 and at the end of week 1 only those subjects reporting at least three cramps per week were allowed to continue
in the study. One group received the combination product during week 2 and quinine sulfate during week 4, while for
the other group this order was reversed. Both groups also received placebo during weeks 3 and 5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both quinine sulfate and the combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E were reported to reduce the frequency of
nocturnal leg muscle cramps in this study. A greater reduction in the frequency of these leg cramps was observed in
subjects taking the combination product compared to subjects taking quinine alone. The difference was reported
to be statistically significant using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. No significant differences were found between
treatments for either duration or severity of attacks. However, as previously discussed (see section I.C., comment
12), the study report did not include the study protocol, details of the statistical analysis, or individual subject
data, and the analysis described does not properly separate carryover effect from treatment effect. Therefore,
it is not possible to conclude that either treatment used in this study was effective for this indication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second clinical study (Ref. 2) was a double-blind, randomized, crossover study conducted at two sites and involved
subjects with at least a 3-month history of at least two significant nocturnal leg muscle cramps per week. The subjects
did not receive any drug for the first 1-week run-in period, then received four treatment periods (5 days each) that
were separated by a 2-day washout period that included a 2-day drug-free period after the last treatment period. Thus,
each subject received each of the four treatments (quinine sulfate 64.8 mg in combination with 400 I.U. vitamin E,
64.8 mg quinine sulfate, 400 I.U. vitamin E, and placebo). A total of 205 subjects (out of 209 subjects originally enrolled)
completed the study at the two locations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each morning upon arising, subjects recorded on a daily evaluation form their response to questions regarding their
difficulty or failure to get to sleep due to night leg cramps and whether or not the cramps had awakened them the previous
night. Subjects were also asked to rate on a scale from 0 (no cramps) to 3 (very difficult) the effect of leg cramps on
their ability to fall asleep and to record the number, time of occurrence, duration, and severity of leg cramps on the
evaluation form. At the end of each weekly treatment period, subjects were asked to complete a global evaluation form
and to record any change in their condition during that period, as follows: Greatly improved, slightly improved,
no improvement, or worse. Subjects who selected ``worse'' were asked to explain why. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment's statistical analysis of the study evaluated the following variables based on portions of the subjects'
daily evaluation forms and their global evaluation of treatment effect: (1) Number of nights per week subjects had
difficulty getting to sleep due to night leg cramps, (2) effect of leg cramps on subject's ability to get to sleep, (3)
number of nights per week that leg cramps prevented subjects from going to sleep, (4) number of nights per week that
leg cramps woke subjects up, (5) number of leg cramps per week, (6) severity of the leg cramps, and (7) subjects' global
evaluations of how their condition changed over the previous week. In addition, the following parameters were derived
from these variables and evaluated: (1) Number of nights per week with leg cramps, (2) mean number of leg cramps per
night, (3) total severity score during each week, (4) mean effect of leg cramps on sleep per week, and (5) mean severity
per cramp. Separate analyses of the results from each site and analysis of pooled results from both study cites were
reported. Vitamin E was found to be statistically significantly superior to placebo in 7 of the 12 efficacy variables
evaluated on the basis of the combined data and in 6 of the 12 variables on the basis of data from at least one of the locations.
The combination was found to be statistically superior to the individual ingredients and placebo on 11 out of the 12
variables evaluated on the basis of both the combined data and data from at least one of the locations. On that same basis,
quinine sulfate was found to be statistically superior to placebo in 9 of the 12 variables evaluated and to vitamin
E in 1 of the 12 variables. The comment concluded that quinine and vitamin E were significantly additive in their effects,
and that it was this additive effect that resulted in the highly significant superiority of the combination over its
individual components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined that the statistical analysis presented with this study is inadequate for review because
the model used does not properly separate the carryover effect from the treatment effect. The model consisted of a
sequence or code effect, a subject within code effect, a visit effect, and a treatment effect. For a given subject,
this model says that code effect is constant over all visits; thus, carryover effect must be partially confounded
with treatment effect. Therefore, the analysis presented cannot be relied upon to demonstrate the efficacy of any
of the treatments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third clinical study was a multicenter, randomized, block, parallel-design with a single-blind, placebo, run-in
period, followed by a 2-week double-blind, randomized, treatment phase (see section I.C., comment 12). No statistically
significant treatment effect of vitamin E was detected at the end of the double-blind phase for any variable in this
study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concludes that the submitted data are inadequate to establish the effectiveness of vitamin E or the combination
of vitamin E and quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Therefore, both
vitamin E individually and in combination with quinine sulfate are nonmonograph conditions.

D. Comments on Labeling
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. Several comments requested revisions in parts of the labeling proposed in the tentative final monograph. Two
comments disagreed with the agency's statement of identity. One comment argued that it was a restatement of the indication
proposed in &sect;343.150(b). In place of the agency's proposed statement of identity (``nocturnal leg muscle cramps
treatment and/or prevention''), one comment requested that ``muscle relaxant pain reliever'' or ``analgesic''
be used. The comment contended that its suggestions were more descriptive of general pharmacological categories
as described in 21 CFR 201.61. Another comment suggested changing the statement to ``night leg cramp relief,'' arguing
that this statement would be more ``meaningful to the layman'' in accord with 21 CFR 201.61. The comment added that
its suggested term is currently used in the labeling of a major OTC quinine product and reflects a more contemporary
description of the condition being treated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Referring to the warning proposed in &sect;343.150(c) that reads ``Discontinue use if ringing in the ears, deafness,
skin rash, or visual disturbances occur,'' one comment requested that the words ``and consult a physician'' be added
following ``discontinue use.'' The comment believed that such a warning would facilitate further medical treatment,
if deemed necessary. The comment added that the agency had proposed similar warnings in other OTC drug monographs,
for example, proposed &sect;333.50(c)(2) and (c)(3) for topical acne drug products (January 15, 1985, 50 FR 2172
at 2181). The comment explained that this addition to the warning would better serve the elderly, the population most
likely to use the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment recommended that the agency distinguish between treatment and prevention directions for the drug, and
proposed the following: ``When night leg cramps occur, take 200&hyph;325 mg at once. To help prevent further night
leg cramps, take 200&hyph;325 mg two hours before bedtime for 14 days. Do not exceed more than 325 mg daily.'' The comment
concluded that, in providing adequate directions for use, it is appropriate to discuss dosages for initial onset
of leg muscle cramps and for prevention of future cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No ingredients for treating and/or preventing nocturnal leg muscle cramps are currently generally recognized as
safe and effective for inclusion in an OTC drug monograph; thus, no OTC labeling is being finalized at this time. Accordingly,
the comments' requests are not being addressed in this document. However, in the event that any ingredient for treating
and/or preventing nocturnal leg muscle cramps reaches OTC drug monograph status, the agency will determine appropriate
labeling at that time and publish it in a future issue of the

II. The Agency's Final Conclusions on OTC Drug Products For The Treatment and/or Prevention of Nocturnal Leg Muscle
Cramps
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency concludes that the data and information submitted are inadequate to establish the safety and effectiveness
of quinine sulfate, vitamin E, or the combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E for the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three clinical studies of vitamin E, alone or in combination with quinine sulfate, were submitted. The report of one
of the studies provided no details of the statistical analysis conducted; the model described in the summary of the
analysis failed to separate carryover effect from treatment effect; and neither the protocol nor the individual
subject data were provided. Independent verification of the conclusions presented, therefore, was not possible.
On the basis of the information provided in the report, no conclusions about the efficacy of vitamin E are possible
from this study. In another study, a statistically significant effect of vitamin E was reported in 7 of 12 endpoints,
and statistically significant differences from placebo were reported in 11 of 12 endpoints for the combination product.
In this study, however, treatment effect was confounded by carryover effect making it impossible to ascribe observed
differences to vitamin E. Further, the third study, a large, multicenter, 2-week, parallel-design study comparing
vitamin E, quinine sulfate, a combination of vitamin E and quinine sulfate, and placebo showed no significant difference
for vitamin E compared to placebo on any parameter at the end of the double-blind treatment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six clinical trials were submitted to establish the safety and efficacy of quinine sulfate in treating and/or preventing
nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Effectiveness results reported as significant were not replicated within or between
studies. In two crossover studies, significant differences between quinine sulfate and placebo were seen only in
the second leg of the crossover, and there were significant pretreatment differences. Analysis of the first leg of
these crossover studies showed no effect of quinine. In a large, 2-week, parallel study of quinine sulfate, vitamin
E, and the combination of these ingredients versus placebo, no statistically significant differences were found
between active treatments and placebo for the full 2 weeks of the study. Furthermore, each study involved multiple
endpoints, none of which was prospectively declared as the primary efficacy variable(s) in any study. Statistical
analysis was conducted without regard to adjustment for multiple comparisons, casting doubt on the validity of claimed
statistical significance in many cases. In three crossover studies, the treatment effect was confounded by potential
carryover effect making it impossible to attribute the results to the study drugs. The agency concludes that the data
and information submitted do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness of quinine sulfate, vitamin E, or
a combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E, in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, new information has raised serious safety concerns over the OTC availability of quinine sulfate for this
use. Adverse events characteristic of quinine toxicity were observed in the healthy populations enrolled in the
clinical efficacy studies at doses of 260 mg and 325 mg daily. These events included: Visual, auditory, and gastrointestinal
symptoms, and fever. Studies of auditory, vestibular, and visual function in subjects given quinine confirm sensory
disturbances at even lower doses. Altered pharmacokinetics with age results in a longer half-life of quinine in older
people that suggests the frequency and severity of adverse effects may be greater in the elderly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these adverse effects, serious and unpredictable hypersensitivity reactions to quinine occur. Symptoms
are often dramatic, leading people to seek medical treatment. Hospitalization may be required, and fatalities have
been reported. While quinine-induced thrombocytopenia is the hypersensitivity reaction most frequently reported
to the agency's spontaneous reporting system, estimates of the incidence of quinine-induced thrombocytopenia
are unreliable. Estimates based on the most direct evidence, however, suggest occurrence rates between 1:1,000
and 1:3,500. Quinine is the only drug available OTC that has such a high association with this serious hematologic
sensitivity. Because there are no known factors that predispose people to the development of hypersensitivity to
quinine, which may occur after 1 week of exposure or after months or years of use, label warnings cannot be expected
to protect consumers from hypersensitivity reactions to quinine products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the benign nature of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, the failure of the clinical studies to demonstrate efficacy
of quinine sulfate in this condition, the evidence of symptoms of quinine toxicity at the OTC doses employed for leg
cramps in a proportion of the target population, and the potential for serious, life threatening, and fatal hypersensitivity
reactions to quinine, the agency concludes that quinine is not safe for OTC use in the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received in response to the agency's request for specific comment on the economic impact of this rulemaking
(47 FR 43562 and 50 FR 46588 at 46593). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An analysis of the cost and benefits of this regulatuion, conducted under Executive Order 12291, was discussed in
the tentative final rule of November 8, 1985, (50 FR 46588). No comments were received in response to the agencies tentative
final rule, and the substances of that analysis has not changed. Executive Order 12291 has been superseded by Executive
Order 12866. FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and, thus, is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Although the final rule will result in the removal of some products from the OTC marketplace,
only a limited number of products are affected. These include: (1) All combination products containing quinine sulfate
and vitamin E, (2) products containing quinine sulfate alone labeled for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps, (3) products containing vitamin E alone labeled with the same claim, and (4) any other products
marketed OTC for this claim. No further initial introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce
of any OTC drug product labeled for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps will be allowed
after the effective date of this final rule. Quinine is currently available as an OTC drug for treating chills and fever
of malaria. Based on an agency review of currently marketed products, it appears that approximately two-thirds of
these quinine-containing products are marketed for antimalarial use (with approximately one-third for the treatment
and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps). (OTC quinine drug products for antimalarial use will be discussed
in future issues of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) Vitamin E is currently available OTC for use as a vitamin. This final rule does not affect the continued marketing
and availability of products containing this vitamin provided the products are not labeled for the treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Products containing quinine sulfate and/or vitamin E may be relabeled
and reformulated where necessary (e.g., combination products) and remain in the marketplace with other allowed
claims, as described above. Accordingly, the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis
is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Drug products containing active ingredients offered over-the-counter (OTC) for the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Quinine sulfate alone or in combination with vitamin E has been present in over-the-counter (OTC) drug products
for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, i.e., a condition of localized pain in the lower
extremities usually occurring in middle life and beyond with no regular pattern concerning time or severity. There
is a lack of adequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of quinine sulfate, vitamin
E, or any other ingredients for OTC use in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. In the doses
used to treat or prevent this condition, quinine sulfate has caused adverse events such as transient visual and auditory
disturbances, dizziness, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Quinine sulfate may cause unpredictable serious
and life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions requiring medical intervention and hospitalization; fatalities
have been reported. The risk associated with use of quinine sulfate, in the absence of evidence of its effectiveness,
outweighs any potential benefit in treating and/or preventing this benign, self-limiting condition. Based upon
the adverse benefit-to-risk ratio, any drug product containing quinine or quinine sulfate cannot be considered
generally recognized as safe for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any OTC drug product that is labeled, represented, or promoted for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (the act), for which an approved application or abbreviated application under section 505 of the act and part 314
of this chapter is required for marketing. In the absence of an approved new drug application or abbreviated new drug
application, such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence that any drug product labeled, represented, or promoted
for OTC use for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps is safe and effective for the purpose
intended must comply with the requirements and procedures governing the use of investigational new drugs set forth
in part 312 of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) After February 22, 1995, any such OTC drug product initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction
into interstate commerce that is not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule executes a major revision of the rules for measurement of vessels using the Panama Canal effective October
1, 1994. The existing rules of measurement are replaced with a simplified, objective approach which brings the Commission's
system in line with an international practice which entered into full application worldwide on July 18, 1994. The
revised measurement rules apply a mathematical formula to the vessel's total volume to produce the basis for assessing
tolls. The tonnage values computed under the proposed system are comparable to those calculated under the Commission's
existing rules and, in the aggregate, are equal to existing tonnages. Accordingly, no changes are made to the rates
of toll for use of the Canal; however, certain administrative changes to the regulations dealing with Canal tolls
are necessary to ensure their consistency with the revised rules of measurement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 1604 of the Panama Canal Act of 1979, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 3794, and
in the regulations at 35 CFR part 70, on April 18, 1994, an advance notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 18332) recommending a complete revision to the Rules for Measurement of Vessels for the Panama Canal contained
in 35 CFR part 135. The change is designed to simplify the Commission's measurement procedures and bring measurement
rules at the Canal in line with the worldwide standard of tonnage measurement as contained in the 1969 International
Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships. At that time, a written analysis showing the basis and justification
for the proposed revision was made available to interested parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised 35 CFR part 135 provides for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Establishment of measurement rules for the Panama Canal Commission which are based on Annex 1 of the Convention;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Transitional relief measures for certain vessels, provided they do not have a structural change which results
in an alteration of 10 percent or more in their total volume; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Continued use of foreign tonnage authorities, and for acceptance of reasonably accurate volumes provided by them;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Correction of tonnage values as necessary to satisfy the Commission's desire for accuracy; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Calculation of volumes for vessels without an International Tonnage Certificate 1969 (ITC 69) through an alternative
tonnage estimating formula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the changes to 35 CFR part 135, certain administrative changes to 35 CFR part 133 (Tolls for Use of Canal)
are required. These changes will reconcile the language of part 133 with the revised part 135 by allowing for the use

Written comments were solicited and received from interested parties, and a public hearing was held May 25, 1994 in
Washington, DC. The views presented by the interested parties were considered by the Board of Directors of the Panama
Canal Commission at its quarterly meeting of July 1994. On July 13, the Board agreed to recommend to the President the
revisions to the existing measurement system and the implementation of the Panama Canal Universal Measurement System
(PC/UMS). The proposed rule and recommendation to the President was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This part establishes the procedures for determining the Panama Canal Universal Measurement System (hereinafter
PC/UMS) Net Tonnage. The tonnage shall be used to assess tolls for use of the Panama Canal. Also, the tonnage may be used,
when adequate volume information is not provided, to assess the charge for admeasurement services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All vessels except warships, floating drydocks, dredges, and vessels subject to transitional relief measures,
applying for passage through the Panama Canal shall present a duly authenticated International Tonnage Certificate
(1969) (hereinafter ITC 69), or suitable substitute (i.e., a certificate derived from a system which is substantially
similar to that which was provided for in the 1969 International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, and which
contains the total volume or allows for the direct mathematical determination of total volume). Vessels without
such total volume information shall be inspected by Canal authorities who shall determine an appropriate volume
for use in the calculation of a PC/UMS Net Tonnage of such vessels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The determination of total volume used in the calculation of PC/UMS Net Tonnage shall be carried out by the Panama
Canal Commission. In so doing, however, the Commission may rely upon total volume information provided by such officials
as are authorized by national governments to undertake surveys and issue national tonnage certificates. Total volume
information presented at the Panama Canal shall be subject to verification, and if necessary, correction insofar
as may be necessary to ensure accuracy to a degree acceptable to the Panama Canal Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Commission may, when it is deemed necessary to verify information contained on the ITC 69, require the submission
of additional documents. Failure to submit the requested documentation may result in the Commission's developing
a figure that accurately reflects the vessel's volume.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Upper Deck 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the uppermost complete deck exposed to weather and sea, which has permanent means of weathertight closing of
all openings in the weather part thereof, and below which all openings in the sides of the ship are fitted with permanent
means of watertight closing. In a ship having a stepped upper deck, the lowest line of the exposed deck and the continuation
of that line parallel to the upper part of the deck is taken as the upper deck.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Moulded Depth 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the vertical distance measured from the top of the keel to the underside of the upper deck at side. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In wood and composite ships the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet. Where the form at the
lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the distance is measured
from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In ships having rounded gunwales, the moulded depth shall be measured to the point of intersection of the moulded
lines of the deck and side shell plating, the lines extending as though the gunwales were of angular design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Where the upper deck is stepped and the raised part of the deck extends over the point at which the moulded depth is
to be determined, the moulded depth shall be measured to a line of reference extending from the lower part of the deck
along a line parallel with the raised part.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Enclosed spaces 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mean all spaces which are bounded by the ship's hull, by fixed or portable partitions or bulkheads, by decks or coverings
other than permanent or movable awnings. No break in a deck, nor any opening in the ship's hull, in a deck or in a covering
of a space, or in the partitions or bulkheads of a space, nor the absence of a partition or bulkhead, shall preclude a
space from being included in the enclosed space.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Excluded spaces 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mean, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, the spaces referred to in paragraphs (e)(1)
to (e)(5) of this section. Excluded spaces shall not be included in the volume of enclosed spaces, except that any such
space which fulfills at least one of the following three conditions shall be treated as an enclosed space:

(1)(i) A space within an erection opposite an end opening extending from deck to deck except for a curtain plate of a
depth not exceeding by more than 25 millimeters (one inch) the depth of the adjoining deck beams, such opening having
a breadth equal to or greater than 90 percent of the breadth of the deck at the line of the opening of the space. This provision
shall be applied so as to exclude from the enclosed spaces only the space between the actual end opening and a line drawn
parallel to the line or face of the opening at a distance from the opening equal to one-half of the width of the deck at
the line of the opening (Figure 1).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is issuing technical amendments to existing Appendix
B and is adding a new non-mandatory Appendix E to both 29 CFR 1910.120, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 29 CFR 1926.65, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The technical amendments to the Appendix B involve the updating of certain reference sources listed in Appendix
B to both 29 CFR 1910.120 and 1910.65. The new Appendix E provides suggested guidelines for a more effective training
curriculum and program. The mandatory requirements for those training programs are set forth in the main body of 29
CFR 1910.120 and 1926.65. The addition of a non-mandatory Appendix E to these sections will provide supplementary
information that can be used by employers for training program development directed toward training those employees
engaged in hazardous waste operations and emergency response activities within the scope of 29 CFR 1910.120 or 1926.65.

Regulatory history

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. On October 17, 1986, former President Reagan signed into law the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of
1986 (SARA) (Pub. L. 99&hyph;499). As part of SARA, the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) was directed to issue an
interim final rule within 60 days after the date of enactment of SARA, which was to provide not less protection for employees
engaged in covered hazardous waste operations than the protection contained in two specified documents. Those two
documents were the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ``Health and Safety Requirements for Employees Engaged
in Field Activities'' manual (EPA ORDER 1440.2), dated 1981, and the existing Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) standards under Subpart C or 29 CFR part 1926, OSHA's Construction Industry Safety and Health Standards. OSHA
published an interim final rule as directed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 19, 1986 (51 FR 45654). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section 126 of SARA, the Congress also directed the Secretary to issue, within one year after the date of enactment
of SARA, a final standard under section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 for the health and safety
of employers engaged in hazardous waste operations and emergency response. SARA also indicated that certain specific
areas of employee protection, in particular employee training, were relevant to protect employees engaged in hazardous
waste operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA issued a proposed rule on hazardous waste operations and emergency including provisions for training on August
10, 1987 (52 FR 29620). Public hearings on the proposed rule were held during October 1987. As a result of that proposed
rule OSHA published a permanent final rule for hazardous waste operations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) on March
6, 1989 (54 FR 9294). That permanent final rule became effective on March 6, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In related action, on December 22, 1987, as part of an omnibus budget reconciliation bill (Pub. L. 100&hyph;202),
the language of SARA was amended. The amendment addressed section 126(d)(3) of SARA. Section 126(d)(3) of SARA reads
as follows before the amendment:

and supervisors have received the specified training and shall prohibit any individual who has not received the specified
training from engaging in hazardous water operations covered by the standard.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment to section 126(d)(3) contained in Pub. L. 100-202 added the following language to the end of paragraph
(d)(3):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
That section 126(d)(3) of SARA is amended by adding a new sentence at the end thereof as follows: The certification
procedures shall be no less comprehensive than those adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency in its Model
Accreditation Plan for Asbestos Abatement Training as required under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act
of 1986.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the amendment, OSHA on January 26, 1990, issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (55 FR 2776) addressing
the accreditation of training programs for hazardous waste operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since January, 1990, OSHA has been working to develop a final rule addressing the accreditation of certain training
programs required in 29 CFR 1910.120 and 29 CFR 1926.65. OSHA will complete shortly action on that final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 30, 1992, OSHA republished 29 CFR 1910.120 in 29 CFR Part 1926 as 1926.65 at the request of the OSHA Advisory Committee
on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH). This republication codified most of the requirements affecting construction
activities in one part of the CFR for the convenience of construction industry employers and employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most recent action on this rule concerns the development of the non-mandatory appendix to be added as Appendix
E to 1910.120. This action took place during the September 30, 1993 meeting of ACCSH held in Washington, DC. As part
of the Advisory Committee's action, a work group chaired by Mr. John Moran, Director of Safety and Health for the Laborers'
Health and Safety Fund made specific recommendations to the full advisory committee concerning OSHA's proposed
29 CFR 1910.121 rulemaking. The first recommendation of the work group was, ``that OSHA promptly issue a non-mandatory
appendix to 1910.120, establishing minimum training curriculum guidelines and minimum training provider guidelines
(ACCSH Tr. pg. 148, lines 22&hyph;25).'' Mr. Moran made a formal motion that the ACCSH recommend, ``the prompt issuance
of a non-mandatory appendix to 1910.120 which contains guidelines for minimum training curriculum, and that minimum
training provider requirements to meet the training standards established in 120 (ACCSH Tr. pg. 152, lines 5&hyph;10).''
The motion was passed unanimously (ACCSH Tr. pg. 159, lines 3&hyph;11). The formal report containing the recommendations
developed by the work group was presented to the Assistant Secretary by the ACCSH on October 1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report included a December, 1991 document titled, ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Training Grant Technical Workshop on Training
Quality developed the document during a technical workshop on training quality. The workshop, ``Minimum Criteria
for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response was held March 22&hyph;24,
1990 in Washington, DC and was sponsored by NIEHS. Approximately 60 individuals from labor, industry and the government,
including representatives from OSHA participated in the workshop.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report recommends that,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA should promptly issue a non-mandatory appendix to 29 CFR 1910.120 which provides guidelines as to minimum training
curriculum and training provider requirements for those training activities mandated by the 1910.120 standard.
It is our recommendation that this appendix be essentially the NIEHS National Technical Workshop consensus document
referred to in the BACKGROUND above and which is appended to this report.&blank;

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ACCSH recommendation to the Assistant Secretary suggested that the non-mandatory appendix address two topics.
First, ACCSH recommended that the appendix should provide guidelines as to the minimum training curriculum for those
training activities mandated by 1910.120. Second, ACCSH recommended that the appendix should provide guidelines
as to the minimum training provider requirements for those training activities mandated by 1910.120.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Non-mandatory Appendix E on Training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Separate from the ACCSH recommendations, several individuals suggested that during the interim period prior to
issuing a final rule on training accreditation, OSHA should add a non-mandatory appendix to 29 CFR 1910.120 and 29
CFR 1926.65 that would provide guidance to employers for developing effective training programs. The training provisions
of these two standards are stated in performance oriented language in paragraph (e) for hazardous waste site workers,
in paragraph (p)(7) for treatment, storage, and disposal facility workers, and in paragraph (q)(6) for emergency
response workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA uses non-mandatory appendices for a number of purposes such as to provide non-regulatory guidance to employees
and employers for the purpose of complying with various OSHA regulations or to assist them in developing more effective
safety and health operations. They may also be an amplification of interpretive information that is included in the
preamble discussions of rulemakings when they are published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is often brought to OSHA's attention that the useful interpretive information included in preamble discussions
addressing OSHA's standards becomes less accessible when rules and regulations are published later in the Code of
Federal Regulations. It has been suggested that having the most important of this type of information available in
the same publication as the codified text of a rule would make compliance decision making in the workplace easier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also non-mandatory appendices provide a non-regulatory mechanism to keep employer and employee populations aware
of new technical information that becomes available to the agency subsequent to the issuance of a standard. These
new technologies and new types of information may be of assistance to employer and employee populations in complying
with the regulatory text to which the appendix is attached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training provider criteria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. OSHA has reviewed the training provider criteria suggested in the ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' OSHA is considering fully the issue in the final rule on certification of training programs. Consequently there
is no need to insert a non-mandatory appendix on this subject. In the interim, OSHA believes that the standard provides
sufficient guidance on the qualifications of instructors and that additional information in an appendix format
is unnecessary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training curriculum guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The document that the ACCSH recommended that OSHA use as the training guidelines to be placed in the non-mandatory
appendix is titled, ``

Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' It was developed to report the results of a technical workshop on training quality held March 22&hyph;24, 1990
in Washington, DC. The meeting was sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIEHS employee training program grantees identified a need to establish criteria for determining the quality of
employee health and safety training programs. This was believed by the workshop to be especially critical for meeting
the training requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rule for hazardous waste
operations and emergency response (29 CFR 1910.120). The NIEHS employee training program grantees planned a workshop
to identify, evaluate, discuss and make recommendations on training quality issues in this area. A planning committee
met twice to develop a draft discussion document for the workshop's deliberations. The workshop brought together
representatives from each of the NIEHS grantees, and invited experts from management, labor, academia, and government.
A balance of such representations was sought for each of the workshop's five sub-sessions. The sub-sessions topics
included the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. General Criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. General hazardous waste operations and site-specific training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. RCRA-treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Emergency response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Guidelines for accreditation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the closing plenary, a draft final report from the workshop was sent out for a review by participants. Comments offered
during the closing plenary and for a period after the meeting were received and included as appropriate in the final
document. The report represents the views of the technical experts rather than an official position by any agency,
including NIEHS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIEHS is authorized under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) to award grants to nonprofit
organizations that demonstrate experience in implementing and operating employee health and safety training and
education programs and that demonstrate the ability to reach and involve in training programs target populations
ow employees who are or will be engaged in hazardous materials waste removal, containment, or emergency response
operations. The grantees who attended the conference met the requirements of and participation in the NIEHS program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has reviewed the guidelines. Overall they would lead to a highly effective training program. Following them
would certainly meet the training requirements of 1910.120 and 1926.65 as a general matter. The detailed guidance
they present would be helpful to trainers and employers and would lead to better training of employees. Accordingly
OSHA is publishing them as a non-mandatory Appendix E to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the legal requirements are set forth in the body of the standards. These require site-specific elements
that of course can not be covered in general guidelines. In addition, some of the guidelines go beyond the clear requirements
of the regulatory text in paragraphs (a) to (q). In those cases, employers would only be cited if the employee's training
did not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (q). Accordingly, Appendix E is not called ``minimum criteria''
as ACCSH entitled them. In addition, there are other training curriculum resources available that can provide additional
guidance to individuals preparing training programs. Therefore, these appendices are not only based upon the NIEHS
document but also upon other training program guidance documents. OSHA has utilized documents developed by the National
Fire Protection Association, the International Association of Fire Service Instructors, and others to supplement
the guidance provided in the NIEHS document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Technical Amendments to Appendix B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It has been brought to the attention of OSHA that certain references made to National Fire Protection Association
standards in Appendix B to 1910.120 and 1926.65 are outdated. OSHA makes reference to NFPA 1991, NFPA 1992, and NFPA
1993 as standards that were under development at the time 29 CFR 1910.120 was published. These references are outdated
because the NFPA standards referred to in the existing text are no longer ``under development'' but were published
in 1990 as voluntary consensus standards by NFPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to Appendix B of 1910.120 and Appendix B of 1926.65 that are contained in this notice recognize the adoption
of these NFPA standards. The revisions correct editorially the text of these appendices to recognize the current
status of the referenced NFPA standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document makes technical amendments and adds a non-mandatory appendix for informational purposes that do not
change regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the agency finds that notice and comments are unnecessary pursuant
to the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and according to OSHA procedural rules in 29 CFR 1911.5.

Since this is a non-mandatory appendix and therefore not an enforceable standard, OSHA recommends that those employers,
employees or volunteers in public sector emergency response organizations outside Federal OSHA jurisdiction consider
the following criteria in developing their own training programs. A unified approach to training at the community
level between emergency response organizations covered by Federal OSHA and those not covered directly by Federal
OSHA can help ensure an effective community response to the release or potential release of hazardous substances
in the community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. General considerations

Incident commander
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incident commander is the individual who, at any one time, is responsible for and in control of the response effort.
This individual is the person responsible for the direction and coordination of the response effort. An incident
commander's position should be occupied by the most senior, appropriately trained individual present at the response
site. Yet, as necessary and appropriate by the level of response provided, the position may be occupied by many individuals
during a particular response as the need for greater authority, responsibility, or training increases. It is possible
for the first responder at the awareness level to assume the duties of incident commander until a more senior and appropriately
trained individual arrives at the response site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, any emergency responder expected to perform as an incident commander should be trained to fulfill the
obligations of the position at the level of response they will be providing including the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Ability to analyze a hazardous substance incident to determine the magnitude of the response problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Ability to plan and implement an appropriate response plan within the capabilities of available personnel and
equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Ability to implement a response to favorably change the outcome of the incident in a manner consistent with the
local emergency response plan and the organization's standard operating procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Ability to evaluate the progress of the emergency response to ensure that the response objectives are being met
safely, effectively, and efficiently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Ability to adjust the response plan to the conditions of the response and to notify higher levels of response when
required by the changes to the response plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal OSHA standards in 29 CFR 1926.65(q) are directed toward private sector emergency responders. Therefore,
the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix are directed toward that employee population. However, they
also impact indirectly through State OSHA or USEPA regulations some public sector emergency responders. Therefore,
the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix may be applied to both employee populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with OSHA state plans must cover their employees with regulations at least as effective as the Federal OSHA
standards. Public employees in states without approved state OSHA programs covering hazardous waste operations
and emergency response are covered by the U.S. EPA under 40 CFR 311, a regulation virtually identical to 1926.65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this is a non-mandatory appendix and therefore not an enforceable standard, OSHA recommends that those employers,
employees or volunteers in public sector emergency response organizations outside Federal OSHA jurisdiction consider
the following criteria in developing their own training programs. A unified approach to training at the community
level between emergency response organizations covered by Federal OSHA and those not covered directly by Federal
OSHA can help ensure an effective community response to the release or potential release of hazardous substances
in the community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. General considerations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emergency response organizations are required to consider the topics listed in 1926.65(q)(6). Emergency response
organizations may use some or all of the following topics to supplement those mandatory topics when developing their
response training programs. Many of the topics would require an interaction between the response provider and the
individuals responsible for the site where the response would be expected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Hazard recognition, including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Nature of hazardous substances present,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Practical applications of hazard recognition, including presentations on biology, chemistry, and physics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Principles of toxicology, biological monitoring, and risk assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Safe work practices and general site safety.

(10) Use, care, and limitations of personal protective equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Safe sampling techniques.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) Rights and responsibilities of employees under OSHA and other related laws concerning right-to-know, safety
and health, compensations and liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Medical monitoring requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Incident commander
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incident commander is the individual who, at any one time, is responsible for and in control of the response effort.
This individual is the person responsible for the direction and coordination of the response effort. An incident
commander's position should be occupied by the most senior, appropriately trained individual present at the response
site. Yet, as necessary and appropriate by the level of response provided, the position may be occupied by many individuals
during a particular response as the need for greater authority, responsibility, or training increases. It is possible
for the first responder at the awareness level to assume the duties of incident commander until a more senior and appropriately
trained individual arrives at the response site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, any emergency responder expected to perform as an incident commander should be trained to fulfill the
obligations of the position at the level of response they will be providing including the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Ability to analyze a hazardous substance incident to determine the magnitude of the response problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Ability to plan and implement an appropriate response plan within the capabilities of available personnel and
equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Ability to implement a response to favorably change the outcome of the incident in a manner consistent with the
local emergency response plan and the organization's standard operating procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Ability to evaluate the progress of the emergency response to ensure that the response objectives are being met
safely, effectively, and efficiently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Ability to adjust the response plan to the conditions of the response and to notify higher levels of response when
required by the changes to the response plan.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice of proposed rulemaking contains proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to &sect;301.6311&hyph;1, to reflect amendments made to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6311 by section 448(a) of the Tax Reform Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1984, Pub. L. 98&hyph;369 (TRA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6311(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the IRS may receive for internal revenue taxes, or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment for internal revenue stamps, checks or money orders, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the extent and under the conditions specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. If money orders or certain kinds of checks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tendered in payment are not duly paid, then section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6311(b)(2) provides the United States with a lien against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all the assets of the drawee or issuer for the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
check or money order. Before its amendment, this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied, in the case of checks, only with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified, treasurer's, or cashier's checks drawn on a bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or trust company. Section 448(a) of TRA expanded section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6311(b)(2) to include guaranteed drafts drawn on financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions other than banks and trust companies. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments to the regulations reflect these changes in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute and permit payment by guaranteed draft in any case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which the regulations under prior law permitted payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by certified, treasurer's, or cashier's check. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations provide a definition of ``financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution.'' Since the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Firearms now has its own separate regulations governing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of payment for certain taxes by check or money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order, which appear in 27 CFR, provisions of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations referring to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Firearms have been removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in EO 12866. Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to these regulations, and, therefore, an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their impact on small business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comments on Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, consideration will be given to any written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for public inspection and copying. A public hearing may be

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing that nonconformance penalties (NCPs) be made available for specific emission standards taking
effect in the 1996 and 1998 model years. In general, the availability of NCPs allows a manufacturer of heavy-duty engines
(HDEs) or heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) (which include heavy light-duty trucks) whose engines or vehicles fail to conform
with certain applicable emission standards, but do not exceed a designated upper limit, to be issued a certificate
of conformity upon payment of a monetary penalty. The specific emission standards for which NCPs have been considered
in this rulemaking are the 1996 and later model year Tier 1 standards for heavy light-duty trucks, the 1996 and later
model year Particulate Matter (PM) standard for urban bus applications, and the 1998 and later model year heavy-duty
diesel engine oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to offer NCPs for the 1996 and later model year particulate matter (PM) standard of 0.10 g/mile for
Light Duty Trucks 3 (LDT3) at full useful life. EPA has considered, but is not proposing to offer NCPs for the other standards.
The proposed upper limit associated with the LDT3 PM standard is the previous diesel-fueled LDT3 vehicle standard
of 0.13 g/mi.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 206(g) of the Clean Air Act (the Act), 42 U.S.C. 7525(g), requires EPA to issue a certificate of conformity
for HDEs or HDVs which exceed an applicable section 202(a) emissions standard, but do not exceed an upper limit associated
with that standard, if the manufacturer pays an NCP established by rulemaking. Congress adopted section 206(g) in
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 as a response to perceived problems with technology-forcing heavy-duty emissions
standards. (It should be noted, however, that the existence of NCPs does not change the criteria under which the standards
have been and will be set under section 202.) Following

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ruckelshaus,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 478 F.2d 615 (D.C. Cir. 1973), Congress realized the dilemma that technology-forcing standards were likely to cause.
If strict standards were maintained, then some manufacturers, ``technological laggards,'' might be unable to comply
initially and would be forced out of the marketplace. NCPs were intended to remedy this potential problem. The laggards
would have a temporary alternative that would permit them to sell their engines or vehicles by payment of a penalty.
At the same time, conforming manufacturers would not suffer an economic disadvantage compared to nonconforming
manufacturers, because the NCP would be based, in part, on money saved by the technological laggard and its customer
from the nonconforming engine or vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 206(g)(1), NCPs may be offered for HDVs or HDEs. The penalty may vary by pollutant and by class or category
of vehicle or engine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HDVs are defined by section 202(b)(3)(C) as vehicles in excess of 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR).
The light-duty truck (LDT) classification includes trucks that have a GVWR of 8500 lbs or less. Therefore, certain
LDTs may be classified as HDVs. Historically, LDTs up through 6000 lbs GVWR have been considered ``light light-duty
trucks'' (LLDTs) and LDTs between 6,001 and 8,500 pounds GVWR have been considered ``heavy light-duty trucks'' (HLDTs).
Based on various new requirements established by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, each of these two light truck
categories has been further subdivided into groups by weight.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LLDTs are classified by weight based on ``loaded vehicle weight,'' or LVW, which maintains its current definition:
curb weight plus 300 lbs. The trucks up through 3750 lbs LVW make up a subclass called light-duty-trucks-1, or LDT1.
Those greater than 3750 lbs LVW but less than or equal to 6000 lbs GVWR are the subclass light-duty-trucks-2, or LDT2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HLDTs are divided at 5750 lbs ``adjusted loaded vehicle weight,'' or ALVW. Adjusted loaded vehicle weight is the
average of the curb weight and the GVWR. The HLDTs that are up through 5750 lbs ALVW are called light-duty trucks-3,
or LDT3. Those above 5750 lbs ALVW but less than or equal to 8500 lbs GVWR are light-duty-trucks-4, or LDT4. The LDT3
and LDT4 subclasses make up the HLDT vehicle class. Since NCPs are only offered for heavy duty vehicles or engines,
this notice addresses only emission standards for light duty trucks of the LDT3 and LDT4 categories.

Section 206(g)(3) requires that NCPs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Account for the degree of emission nonconformity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Increase periodically to provide incentive for nonconforming manufacturers to achieve the emission standards;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Remove the competitive disadvantage to conforming manufacturers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 206(g) authorizes EPA to require testing of production vehicles or engines in order to determine the emission
level on which the penalty is based. If the emission level of a vehicle or engine exceeds an upper limit of nonconformity
established by EPA through regulation, the vehicle or engine would not qualify for an NCP under section 206(g) and
no certificate of conformity could be issued to the manufacturer. If the emission level is below the upper limit but
above the standard, that emission level becomes the ``compliance level,'' which is also the benchmark for warranty
and recall liability; the manufacturer who elects to pay the NCP is liable for vehicles or engines that exceed the compliance
level in-use, unless, for the case of HLDTs, the compliance level is below the in-use standard. The manufacturer does
not have in-use warranty or recall liability for emissions levels above the standard but below the compliance level.

A. Review of NCP Eligibility Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The generic NCP rule (Phase I) established three basic criteria for determining the eligibility of emission standards
for nonconformance penalties in any given model year. See 40 CFR 1103&hyph;87. First, the emission standard in question
must become more difficult to meet. This can occur in two ways, either by the emission standard itself becoming more
stringent, or due to its interaction with another emission standard that has become more stringent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, substantial work must be required in order to meet the emission standard. EPA considers ``substantial work''
to mean the application of technology not previously used in that vehicle or engine class/subclass, or a significant
modification of existing technology, in order to bring that vehicle/engine into compliance. EPA does not consider
minor modifications or calibration changes to be classified as substantial work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, a technological laggard must be likely to develop. A technological laggard is defined as a manufacturer who
cannot meet a particular emission standard due to technological (not economic) difficulties and who, in the absence
of NCPs, might be forced from the marketplace. EPA will make the determination that a technological laggard is likely
to develop, based in large part on the above two criteria. However, these criteria are not always sufficient to determine
the likelihood of the development of a technological laggard. An emission standard may become more difficult to meet
and substantial work may be required for compliance, but if that work merely involves transfer of well-developed
technology from another vehicle class, it is unlikely that a technological laggard would develop.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The above criteria were used to determine eligibility for NCPs during Phase II of the NCP rulemaking (50 FR 53454, December
31, 1985). NCPs were offered for the following 1987 and 1988 model year standards: the particulate matter (PM) standard
for 1987 diesel-fueled light-duty trucks with loaded vehicle weight in excess of 3750 pounds (LDDT2s), the 1987 gasoline-fueled
light HDE (LHDGE) HC and CO emission standards, the 1988 diesel-fueled HDE (HDDE) PM standard, and the 1988 HDDE NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The availability of NCPs for 1991 model year HDE standards was addressed during Phase III of the NCP rulemaking (55
FR 46622, November 5, 1990). NCPs were offered for the following: the 1991 HDDE PM standard for petroleum-fueled urban
buses, the 1991 HDDE PM standard for petroleum-fueled vehicles other than urban buses, the 1991 petroleum-fueled
HDDE NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard, and the PM emission standard for 1991 and later model year petroleum-fueled light-duty diesel trucks greater
than 3750 lbs loaded vehicle weight (LDDT2s). As discussed in the Phase III preamble, NCPs were also considered but
not offered for the methanol-fueled heavy-duty diesel engine and heavy-duty gasoline engine standards as it was
concluded that those standards did not meet the eligibility criteria established in the generic rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Phase III of the NCP rulemaking described how NCPs would be integrated into the HDE NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The availability of NCPs for HDVs and HDEs subject to the 1994 and later model year emission standards for particulate
matter (PM) was addressed by Phase IV of the NCP rulemaking (58 FR 68532, December 28, 1993). NCPs were offered for the
following: the 1994 and later model year PM standard for heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDEs) used in urban buses, and
the 1994 and later model year PM standard for HDDEs used in vehicles other than urban buses. NCPs were also considered,
but not offered for the 1994 and later model year methanol-fueled HDE PM standard and the 1994 and later model year cold
carbon monoxide (CO) standard for heavy light-duty gasoline fueled trucks.

NCPs were not considered for the Tier 1 ``in-use'' standards since NCPs are a mechanism to allow manufacturers to certify
engine families, not to assist manufacturers in complying with ``in-use'' standards. The remainder of this proposal
addresses whether NCPs should be made available for the 1996 Urban Bus PM standard of 0.05 g/BHP-hr, the 1998 HDE NO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since there is no NMHC standard for earlier model year LDT3s, the new NMHC standard represents an increase in stringency
over the THC standard for previous model years, satisfying the first eligibility criterion. EPA acknowledges that
one manufacturer has indicated that it may have difficulty complying with this standard. Based on the manufacturer's
planned strategy, however, EPA does not believe that substantial work, as described above, will be necessary to meet
the new standard for either the intermediate useful-life level of 0.32 g/mi or the full useful-life level of 0.46 g/mi,
since it does not represent a major modification of existing technology. EPA also does not believe that a technological
laggard is likely to develop, based on discussions with vehicle manufacturers. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing
to offer NCPs for this standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that the new CO standard of 6.4 g/mi at full useful life represents an increase in stringency over the
prior standard of 10 g/mi at full useful life for LDT3s, satisfying the first eligibility criterion. Based on 1993
model year certification levels, only one manufacturer is currently producing LDT3 vehicles which would not meet
the new standard at full useful life. Since this manufacturer does not anticipate difficulty in meeting the new CO
standards, EPA does not believe that a technological laggard is likely to develop. The half useful-life standard
of 4.4 g/mi is considered by EPA and manufacturers to be less difficult to meet compared with the full useful life standard.
For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs for these standards.

those manufacturers possess the desirable technology to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new standard, and EPA does not believe that a technological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laggard is likely to develop among manufacturers of that group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The half useful-life standard for non-diesel vehicles of 0.70

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet compared with the full useful life standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the case of diesel-fueled LDT3s, however, EPA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the increased stringency is likely to require substantial work to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the PM standard because most conventional means of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no previous PM standard for non-diesel-fueled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LDT3s. Since it is well-recognized in the industry that non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fueled vehicles emit very low levels of particulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter, no work should be required by manufacturers to meet this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new standard and no technological laggard should develop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that the new PM standard of 0.10 g/mi at full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life represents an increase in stringency over the prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of 0.13 g/mi at full useful life for diesel-fueled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LDT3s, satisfying the first eligibility criterion. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussions with current manufacturers, at least one manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is adapting technology from similar engines, but having different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service requirements. Significant work will probably be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the technology adaptation specified by that manufacturer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially when considering the interrelationship of the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PM emissions of diesel-fueled engines, as stated above. EPA also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that a technological laggard may develop because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

e. 1996 Tier 1 Non-Methane Hydrocarbon (NMHC) Standard for LDT4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no NMHC standard for earlier model year LDT4s. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both EPA and vehicle manufacturers believe that the NMHC standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents an increase in stringency over the THC standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous model year LDT4s, satisfying the first eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion. The same manufacturer that expressed concern in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the NMHC standard for LDT3 has similar concerns in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting this standard and will use a similar strategy to lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emissions. For the same reasons stated in the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of the NMHC standard for LDT3s, EPA does not propose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to offer NCPs for the NMHC standard at either the intermediate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the full useful life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

f. 1996 Tier 1 CO Standard for LDT4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that the new CO standard of 7.3 g/mi at full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life represents an increase in stringency over the prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of 10 g/mi at full useful life for LDT4s, satisfying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first eligibility criterion. Based on discussions with current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers of affected vehicles, EPA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers will not have difficulty in meeting the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. Since there are no 1993 model year LDT4s with CO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification levels higher than the new standard at full useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life, EPA does not believe that a technological laggard is likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to develop. The half useful-life standard of 5.0 g/mi is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally considered by EPA and manufacturers to be less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to meet compared with the full useful life standard of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7.3 g/mi. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these standards.

X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard of 1.53 g/mi at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full useful life represents some increase in stringency over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior standard of 1.7 g/mi at full useful life for LDT4s, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfying the first eligibility criterion. Based on discussions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with current manufacturers of affected vehicles, and based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact that there were no model year 1993 LDT4s certified which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would exceed the new standard at full useful life, EPA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that substantial work, as described above, will not be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of manufacturers and that a technological laggard is not likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to develop. The half useful-life standard for non-diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles of 1.10 g/mi is generally considered by EPA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers to be less difficult to meet compared with the full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life standard. For these reasons, EPA does not propose to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offer NCPs for the new LDT4 NO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that the new PM standard of 0.12 g/mi at full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life represents an increase in stringency over the prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of 0.13 g/mi at full useful life for LDT4s, satisfying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first eligibility criterion. As in the case of non-diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LDT3s, no work should be required to meet the new PM standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-diesel LDT4s. And based on discussions with current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers of diesel-fueled LDT4 vehicles and on 1993 model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year certification levels, EPA does not believe that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological laggard is likely to develop or that substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work, as described above, will be required to meet the new PM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the new LDT4 PM standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

i. 1996 HDDE Urban Bus PM Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1996 HDDE urban bus PM standard of 0.05 g/BHP-hr is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent than the previous 1994 0.07 g/BHP-hr PM standard it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
superseding. EPA recognizes that some work may be necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the urban bus engine manufacturers to comply with the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. Based on discussions with those manufacturers, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not believe that a technological laggard is likely to exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reinforcing that belief is the fact that the 0.05 g/BHP-hr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard was originally proposed as a 1994 standard. Detroit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Diesel Corporation successfully argued that they could not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively comply by 1994, and that if the 0.05 g/BHP-hr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard was delayed until 1996, and a standard of 0.07 g/BHP-hr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was adopted in 1994, compliance could be achieved more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiently. Furthermore, compliance with the 0.05 g/BHP-hr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard has been demonstrated in certification using a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate trap system. And a catalyst equipped 1994 urban bus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine tested as low as 0.05 g/bhp-hr, although it certified to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.07 g/bhp-hr. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCPs for the 1996 0.05 g/BHP-hr PM standard for HDDE used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urban buses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard of 4.0 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g/BHP-hr is an increase in stringency over the present 5.0 g/BHP-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hr standard. EPA also believes, based on discussions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current manufacturers of HDEs, that additional work will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to comply with the new standard. Improvements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turbochargers, conversion of remaining mechanical fuel injection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems to electronic control, and, in some cases, the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust gas catalytic converters will be necessary. But, based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on those same discussions with manufacturers, and considering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact that the standard does not become effective for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional four years from this time, EPA believes that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological laggard is not likely to develop. Therefore, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not propose to offer NCPs for the 1998 HDE NO

III. Penalty Rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is the most recent in a series of NCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemakings. The discussion of penalty rates in the Phase IV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (58 FR 68532, December 28, 1993), Phase III rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(55 FR 46622, November 5, 1990), the Phase II rulemaking (50 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
53454, December 31, 1985) as well as the Phase I rulemaking (50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 35374, August 30, 1985) are incorporated by reference. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section briefly reviews the penalty rate formula and discusses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how EPA arrived at the penalty rates in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emphasis will be placed on procedures different from those used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to derive penalty rates during Phase II, Phase III, or Phase IV.

A. Parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As in the previous NCP rules, EPA is specifying values for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following parameters in the NCP formula for each standard: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, COC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
90
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, MC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and F. The NCP formula is the same as that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated in the Phase I rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is an estimate of the industrywide average incremental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost per engine (references to engines are intended to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles as well) associated with meeting the standard for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an NCP is offered, compared with meeting the upper limit. COC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is based on typical engine technology, as nearly as EPA can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify it. As in the previous NCP rules, costs include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional manufacturer costs and additional owner costs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other NCP rules did not include certification costs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of COC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and none will be allowed in this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule because both complying and noncomplying manufacturers must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incur certification costs.

MC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is an estimate of the industrywide average marginal cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance per unit of reduced pollutant associated with the least cost effective emission control technology installed
to meet the new standard. MC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is measured in dollars per g/BHP-hr for HDEs and in dollars per gram per mile (g/mi) for LDTs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F is a factor used to derive MC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
90
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the 90th percentile marginal cost of compliance with the NCP standard for engines in the NCP category. MC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
90
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is defined as being the slope of the penalty rate curve near the standard and is equal to MC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 multiplied by F. For this rulemaking, as was the case in the previous NCP rules, EPA has determined that no reasonable

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate of MC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
90
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can be made based on existing marginal cost data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and has thus set F at a presumptive value of 1.2. This approach was generally supported by commenters on the past NCP
rulemakings.

The values of the compliance parameters are based on the cost of projected engine modifications and the use of an oxidation
catalyst for PM reduction as outlined in ``Calculation of Nonconformance Penalty Rates for 1996 and Later Model Year
LDT3 Particulate Matter (PM) Standards''. While the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of complying with the PM standard using a particulate trap exists, it is not considered by EPA or industry to be a likely
solution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a previous PM standard of 0.13 g/mi exists, EPA is proposing that the upper limit which cannot be exceeded by LDT3
vehicles shall be 0.13 g/mi.

IV. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant''
and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines ``significant
regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100
million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal
governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned
by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs
or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. This regulation will not have an annual effect on the economy in
excess of $100 million and will not cause a major increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price of HDEs above those that would otherwise occur from compliance with the emission standards themselves. This
regulation is intended to assist manufacturers that are having difficulty developing and marketing vehicles which
comply with the 1996 Tier 1 PM standard for LDT3s. Without this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, a manufacturer experiencing difficulty in complying with this new emission standard (after the use of credits)
has only two alternatives: fix the nonconforming engines for the associated model years or not sell them at all. NCPs
provide manufacturers with additional time to bring their engines into conformity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NCPs are calculated to deprive nonconforming manufacturers of any cost savings and competitive advantages
stemming from marketing a nonconforming engine. Thus, NCPs will not have significant adverse effects on competition,
employment, investment, productivity, innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete
with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the use of NCPs is optional, manufacturers have the flexibility and will likely choose whether or not to use
NCPs based on their ability to comply with emissions standards. If no HDE manufacturer elects to use NCPs, these manufacturers
and the users of their products will not incur any additional costs related to NCPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCPs remedy the potential problem of having a manufacturer forced out of the marketplace due to that manufacturer's
inability to conform to new, strict emission standards in a timely manner. Without NCPs, a manufacturer which has
difficulty certifying HDEs in conformance with emission standards or whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines fail a SEA has only two alternatives: fix the nonconforming engines, perhaps at a prohibitive cost, or prevent
their introduction into commerce. The availability of NCPs provides manufacturers with a third alternative: continue
production and introduce into commerce upon payment of a penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an engine that exceeds the standard until an emission conformance technique is developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, NCPs represent a regulatory mechanism that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows affected manufacturers to have increased flexibility. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision to use NCPs may be a manufacturer's only way to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to introduce HDEs into commerce. Hence, NCPs may be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to have no adverse economic impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

VI. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When evaluating the environmental impact of this proposed rule, one must keep in mind that, under the Act, NCPs are
a consequence of enacting new, more stringent emissions requirements for heavy duty engines. Emission standards
are set at a level that most, but not necessarily all, manufacturers can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve by the model year in which the standard becomes effective. Following 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Harvester
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ruckelshaus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 478 F.2d 615 (D.C. Cir. 1973), Congress realized the dilemma that technology-forcing standards were likely to cause,
and allowed manufacturers of heavy-duty engines to certify nonconforming vehicles/engines upon the payment of
an NCP, under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. This mechanism would allow manufacturer(s) who cannot meet technology-forcing standards immediately
to continue to manufacture these nonconforming engines while they tackle the technological problems associated
with meeting new emission standard(s). Thus, as part of the statutory structure to force technological improvements
without driving manufacturers out of the market, NCPs provide flexibility that fosters long-term emissions improvement
through the setting of lower emission standards at an earlier date than could otherwise be possible. By design, NCPs
encourage the technological laggard that is using NCPs to reduce emission levels to the more stringent standard as
quickly as possible.

VII. Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. None of the affected manufacturers
could be classified as small. Moreover, as already discussed, the NCP program can be expected to benefit manufacturers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some small entities do exist as manufacturers' contractors for the testing of engines for Production Compliance
Audits (PCAs). It is EPA's practice to conduct PCA scheduling (namely, tests per day limitations) in such a way as to
consider the staff and manpower capabilities of such contractors and avoid any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems. The result is that these entities are not adversely affected. Thus, I certify that this proposed rule will
not have any adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Information Collection Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule requires that manufacturers perform certain record keeping and submit certain reports to EPA.
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 USC 3501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, provides that reporting and record keeping requirements be approved by OMB before they can be enforced by EPA. The
information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been addressed in previous rulemaking and approved
by OMB (OMB control no. 2060&hyph;0132). At the time of the final rulemaking the Agency will submit an Inventory Correction
Worksheet to OMB amending the approved burden hours to reflect the additional reports required by this rulemaking.
However, any person wishing to comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these requirements is invited to do so. Comments on these requirements should be submitted to Chief, Information
Policy Branch, 2136, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460 and to OMB, Office
of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 726 Jackson Place, NW, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer
for EPA.'' The final rule will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
for the chemical substance described as modified propylene glycol ether, which is the subject of premanufacture
notice (PMN) P&hyph;93&hyph;507. This proposal would require certain persons who intend to manufacture, import,
or process this substance for a significant new use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing
or processing activities for a use designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice would provide
EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before
it can occur.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed SNUR would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import,
or processing of the substance identified as modified propylene glycol ether for the significant new uses described
herein. The required notice would provide EPA with information with which to evaluate an intended use and associated
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed
in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B)
of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical
substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a
category of chemical substances. Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and
EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular,
these requirements include the information submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions
authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3), and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives
a significant new use notice (SNUN), EPA may take regulatory action under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the
activities for which it has received a SNUN. If EPA does not take action, section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its reasons for not taking action. Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are
subject to the export notification provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b)
appear at 40 CFR part 707. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

II. Applicability of General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. Regulatory provisions
covering user fees applicable to significant new use notices are codified at 40 CFR part 700 under the authority of
TSCA section 26(b). Interested persons may refer to these sections for further information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to establish significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the chemical dipropylene glycol
dimethyl ether. The proposed SNUR designates as significant new uses: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any manner or method of manufacturing, importing, or processing associated with any use of the substance without
the use of dermal protection, including gloves, that provides an impervious barrier to the substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Annual manufacture and importation volume for any use greater than 4 times the yearly volume specified in the PMN
for the substance (annual production total must include quantities manufactured for export and for all domestic
uses).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Use of the substance in a consumer product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 2, 1993, EPA received a PMN, designated as P&hyph;93&hyph;507, for a modified propylene glycol ether.
Based on test data on the PMN substance, submitted with the PMN and during the review period, EPA has concerns for the
substance's potential to cause adverse systemic, maternal, and fetal effects. The greatest potential for risk appears
to be associated with the dermal route of exposure. The extent to which the Agency expects that adverse effects may
occur relates in large part to the isomer mix of the PMN substance, which is a combination of three individual isomers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the ratio of these isomers in the PMN substance is maintained at certain levels, the Agency considers the potential
risk to workers during manufacturing, processing, and use to be reasonable; however, if the formulation contains
a high percentage of an isomer for which the suspected human health hazard is significant, the Agency might consider
the risk to workers to be unreasonable. Although the Agency does not consider the higher risk formulations likely
to be made, and is reasonably confident that the isomer of greatest potential concern will be present at low levels
(&lt;5 percent) in the formulation, the PMN submitter was not able to specify with certainty the percentage at which
each isomer would be present in the PMN substance. Consequently, there is potential for the PMN substance to be formulated
in isomer ratios that may present an unreasonable risk to human health as described above. In deciding not to regulate
the PMN submitter through an administrative consent order, the Agency balanced the potential risks from certain
isomer formulations with the benefits to worker safety offered by the PMN substance as a substitute for more potentially
hazardous glycol ethers. Another factor in the Agency's decision not to regulate the PMN substance through an order
was the product stewardship program that the submitter had established for the substance, which included up-front
glove testing to ensure that accurate information on dermal protection would be communicated to workers exposed
to the substance. The results of the glove testing indicated that permeation at rates that might present an unreasonable
risk could occur with certain glove models. The Agency considers it prudent and necessary, therefore, that any glove
or dermal protective clothing intended for use in handling the PMN substance be tested, or the specifications from
the manufacturer or supplier evaluated, prior to use. This testing or evaluation must ensure that the protective
item will be impervious to the PMN substance for the expected duration and conditions of exposure, which includes
the likely combinations of other chemicals to which the item may be exposed in the work area. (Each piece of personal
protective equipment must be selected and used in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.132 and 1910.133.) Handling the PMN
substance without the use of equipment that provides an impervious barrier to it would be considered a significant
new use requiring Agency notice and appropriate justification. Based in part on the submitter's commitment to incorporate
the results of the glove study in its product literature, the Agency considered regulation of the submitter to require
use of dermal protective equipment under a consent order unnecessary, especially in view of the substance's relative
human health advantages. The balance in favor of non-regulation might shift, however, if aspects of the manufacture
and use of the PMN substance were to change from those on which the Agency's risk assessment was originally based. The
production volume estimated by the submitter in its PMN, for example, is expected to result in relatively few workers
being exposed to the PMN substance. If the production level were to increase substantially, however, the number of
workers and the duration of exposure_especially during manufacture_would increase proportionately. As a consequence,
EPA would need to revisit its original risk assessment, consider whether a potential unreasonable risk might result
at the higher production levels and whether to regulate to mitigate that risk. Of course, if this increase in production
volume were coupled with formulation of the PMN substance with a proportionally greater amount of the isomers of concern,
the potential risk to workers would increase as well. The filing of a SNUN based on production volume would afford the
Agency an opportunity to evaluate not only the increased worker exposures and risks, but also the risks associated
with a particular isomer formulation of the PMN substance, the knowledge of which would be based on actual production
experience. For purposes of determining the annual PMN production volume and compliance with the volume limitation,
quantities of the PMN substance manufactured for both domestic use and export should be totaled (i.e. considered
in aggregate), even if the export volumes were formerly manufactured ``for export only.'' Once domestic manufacture
is intended or commences, all volumes produced_both for domestic consumption and export_are subject to PMN reporting
requirements and TSCA section 5 regulation. Also, the annual production total should reflect manufacture or import
volumes for any and all uses; the total should not be calculated on a per-use-basis. (See 40 CFR 720.45 and associated
Agency guidance documents and instructions.) In addition, while the potential risk to workers from exposure to the
PMN substance might be considered reasonable, similar exposures and risks to the general population by way of consumer
uses for the PMN substance might not. The Agency considers potential risks to workers to be mitigated in part by the
greater level of protective measures normally found in the workplace and the generally greater awareness among workers
of the potential hazards associated with the substances they handle. Consumers, on the other hand, usually are not
as aware of potential hazards, do not have access to the same types of information and protections available to workers,
and therefore are potentially at greater risk if exposed to a hazardous new substance in a consumer product. Thus,
in an effort to prevent an unreasonable risk to the general population, the PMN substance cannot be manufactured or
processed for a consumer use until that use and the potential exposures and risks associated with it have been reviewed
and evaluated by the Agency. In summary, for the reasons described above, the Agency has designated handling the PMN
substance without adequate dermal protection, production volume when it reaches a substantial level per year, and
any consumer use of the PMN substance as significant new uses.

IV. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as
of the date of proposal rather than as of the effective date of the rule. If uses which had commenced between that date
and the effective date of this rulemaking were considered ongoing, rather than new, any person could defeat the SNUR
by initiating a significant new use before the effective date. This would make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR
notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance for
uses regulated under this SNUR after the date of this proposed rule will have to cease any such activity before the effective
date of the rule. To resume their activities, such persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements
and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires. EPA, not wishing to unnecessarily disrupt
the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of a significant new use before
the effective date of the SNUR, has promulgated provisions to allow such persons to comply with this proposed SNUR
before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions of advance compliance as codified at &sect;721.45(h),
the person would be considered to have met the requirements of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin
commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance between proposal and the effective date of the SNUR
do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule.
To resume their activities, these persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait
until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires.

VIII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant'' and
is therefore not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected
by this proposed rule would likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUNs for this substance.
Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by the proposed rule would not be substantial,
even if all of the SNUN submitters were small firms. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and has assigned OMB control number 2070&hyph;0012. Public reporting burden for this collection of information
is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response, with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing
and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this
collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch
(2131), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The
final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information requirements contained in this proposal.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Emergency Management Agency proposes to make determinations of base flood elevations and modified base
flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with Section 110 of the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State,
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service is proposing on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim basis to conditionally approve the use of bismuth-tin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shot (in a mixture of [nominally] 97&hyph;3 percents, respectively) as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nontoxic for the taking of waterfowl and coots during the 1994&hyph;95 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hunting season. This proposed action responds to a petition for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking by the Bismuth Cartridge Company, dated June 14, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and received by the Service on June 24, 1994. Specifically, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition requests that the Service modify the provisions of 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR, section 20.21(j), to make legal the use of bismuth-tin shot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on an interim, conditional basis for the 1994&hyph;95 and the 1995&hyph;96 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seasons. The Bismuth Cartridge Company petition acknowledges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for completion of the nontoxic shot approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures studies outlined in 50 CFR, 20.134, before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final approval is considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petition for rulemaking cites as reasons in support of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposal the following: a) bismuth is nontoxic; b) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule is conditional; and c) the evidence presented in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the record, i.e., the application from the Bismuth Cartridge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition for rulemaking follows two applications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final approval, one dated October 21, 1993, and the other dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 30, 1993, that were provided to the Service. In reply, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service responded that the applications were deficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the bismuth-based shot material expected to be loaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into shotshells had not been found through preliminary testing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be nontoxic. Preliminary toxicity testing by the applicants had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been with (essentially) pure bismuth only. Thus, there was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(either available or provided with the application) adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific data covering toxicity of the material to be loaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into shotshells. However, the Service pledged in both replies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work with the applicants to process the applications in as timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a fashion as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the mid-1970s, the Service has sought to identify shot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that when spent does not pose a significant hazard to migratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
birds and other wildlife. Ingestion of spent lead shot has long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been identified as a source of significant mortality in migratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
birds. The Service first addressed the issue of lead poisoning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in waterfowl in a 1976 environmental impact statement (EIS), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later readdressed the issue in a 1986 supplemental EIS. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latter provided the scientific justification for the ban on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of lead shot for hunting waterfowl and coots that was begun 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1986 and completed in 1991. Currently, only steel shot has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been approved by the Service Director as nontoxic. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service believes that there may be other suitable candidate shot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials available which could be approved for use as nontoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shot. The Service is anxious to consider these other potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
candidates for approval as nontoxic, and does not feel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constrained to limit nontoxic shot options.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation relative to use of nontoxic shot and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concomitant endorsement by the Service of steel shot has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated some controversy. Some hunters still believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steel shot is less ballistically efficient than lead and can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage shotgun barrels, although the Service believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of hunters have accepted steel as an effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative to lead. However, resistance to the use of steel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shot is undoubtedly creating an unknown level of noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirement to use nontoxic shot for waterfowl and coot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hunting. The availability of an alternative to steel shot will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the public greater choice during an interim period and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thus, could improve hunter compliance with nontoxic shot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in waterfowl hunting situations. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased hunter use of this alternative shot could benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upland game bird habitats, and upland game birds as well, through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the diminished use of lead shot in those areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is proposing this conditional, interim approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basis of what is known about the toxicity of bismuth and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tin, principally the former because it makes up almost all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the shot. However, test results with tin include those by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grandy et al. (1968) in which there were no deaths associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with mallards dosed with tin shot. For bismuth, there are three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially recent and relevant studies that support this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a 30-day acute toxicity study now being completed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth-tin shot, Sanderson et al. (1994) report no mortality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with dosage of mallard ducks. Although the dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase and preliminary analyses have been completed, concluding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tissue examination and analyses remain to be carried out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this concluding work will be completed before any final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking; when reviewing the preliminary results, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doubtful that any dramatically different findings are yet to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sanderson et al. (1992), over the course of a 30-day acute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity study on captive-reared mallards with three different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shot-types, i.e., lead, essentially pure bismuth and iron shot, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found no mortality associated with bismuth. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations on the absorption of bismuth based on estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excreted quantities, with known amounts in blood, liver, bone and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
muscle (a range of none to minute amounts) suggest that most of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bismuth eroded from the shot as a result of gizzard action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was excreted in the feces. Sanderson et al. (1992) state that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``All nine ducks (three control, three Bi8 and three Fe8) examined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the end of the study had normal amounts of muscle and abundant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fat depots. Internal organs were within normal limits. No 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant differences were observed among the three groups of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ducks.'' (Numbers behind symbols refer to dosage rates, i.e., 8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth and 8 iron shot, which is the maximum number of the range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the experimental design.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ringelman et al. (1992) conducted a 32-day acute toxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study which involved dosing game-farm mallards with a shot alloy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of tungsten-bismuth-tin (TBT), which was 39, 44.5 and 16.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent by weight, respectively. No dosed birds died during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trial, and behavior was normal. Examination of tissues post-euthanization revealed no toxicity or damage related
to shot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. Blood calcium differences between dosed and undosed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
birds were judged to be unrelated to shot exposure. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth concentrations in kidney and liver were near detectable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits, they did not differ between dosed and undosed birds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This study concluded that ``...TBT shot presents virtually no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for acute intoxication in mallards under the conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this study.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sanderson et al. (1992) have reviewed the relevant, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mostly earlier, literature with regard to the toxicity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth. This literature provides little in the way of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison to the results of the types of toxicity studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the Service and cited here. However, this literature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides findings which tend not to create a concern for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential metallic bismuth-related intoxication in waterfowl when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingested. Although there have been some human neurological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems reported that are related to chronic use of organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth compounds, bismuth (especially metallic) is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered a serious industrial hazard to humans. A common use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of bismuth is in pharmaceuticals for stomach ailments; bismuth is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the principal active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The studies cited here for support of the application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent only the first of a series of three toxicity tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 50 CFR 20.134, before a final approval can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given to the applicant by the Director of the Service. The other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two toxicity tests required are for: (1) long-term chronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure; and (2) reproduction. The Service believes it has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient flexibility in the regulations to approach final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval in a step manner. That is, acute toxicity tests and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other toxicity information suggest that a 1-year conditional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval can be provided without significant risk to migratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bird resources. If indicated, second and third 1-year approvals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be provided until the series of toxicity tests are completed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at which time, final approval may be made. This series of tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to be completed before the Service would consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final approval of bismuth-tin shot as nontoxic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bismuth-tin shot is currently approved by the Canadian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wildlife Service for use in nontoxic shot zones on a conditional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis under terms similar to those described above. Bismuth-tin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shot is also used in several European countries, and elsewhere in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the world.

In summary, this rule proposes to conditionally approve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of bismuth-tin shot for waterfowl and coot hunting for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994&hyph;95 season. The applicants, who wish to obtain final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval for their shot as nontoxic, would be required to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
season-by-season approval until they have successfully completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of the tests in the testing procedures required by 50 CFR, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 20.134.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4332(C)), and the Council on Environmental Quality's regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508), the Service will comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with NEPA prior to implementation of the final rule.

Endangered Species Act Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543; 87 Stat. 884), provides that, ``The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall review other programs administered by him and utilize such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs in furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' (and) shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out .&blank;.&blank;. is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered species or threatened species or result in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat .&blank;.&blank;.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the Service will initiate Section 7 consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Endangered Species Act for this proposed rulemaking to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legalize, on an interim and conditional basis, the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth-tin shot for hunting waterfowl and coots during the 1994- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95 seasons. When completed, the results of the Service's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspected by the public in, and will be available to the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seq.) requires the preparation of flexibility analyses for rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will have a significant effect on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities, which includes small businesses, organizations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or governmental jurisdictions. However, the Service has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that this rule will have no effect on small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the shot to be approved will merely supplement nontoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shot already in commerce and available throughout the retail and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wholesale distribution systems. No dislocation or other local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects, with regard to hunters and others, are apt to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidenced. This rule was not subject to Office of Management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget (OMB) review under Executive Order 12866. This rule does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not contain any information collection efforts requiring approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3504.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations regarding decommissioning of licensed
facilities to provide specific radiological criteria for the decommissioning of lands and structures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed criteria would apply to the decommissioning of all licensed facilities and facilities subject to the
Commission's jurisdiction. The Commission expects to apply these criteria in determining the adequacy of remediation
of residual radioactivity resulting from the possession or use of source, byproduct, and special nuclear material.
For high-level and low-level waste disposal facilities, the criteria would apply only to ancillary surface facilities
that support radioactive waste disposal activities because criteria for closure of the remainder of the facility
and termination of the license are currently specified. For uranium mills, the criteria apply to decommissioning
of the facility but not to soil cleanup and the disposal of uranium mill tailings. The criteria would apply to decommissioning
of nuclear facilities that operate through their normal lifetime, as well as to those that may be shut down prematurely.
However, they would not apply to sites already covered by a decommissioning plan approved by the Commission before
the effective date of this rule, if it is adopted in final form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this rulemaking is to provide a clear and consistent regulatory basis for determining the extent to which
lands and structures must be remediated before a site can be considered decommissioned. The Commission believes
that inclusion of criteria in the regulations would result in more efficient and consistent licensing actions related
to the numerous and frequently complex site remediation and decommissioning activities anticipated in the future.
The Commission has reassessed the basis for the residual contamination levels contained in existing guidance in
light of changes in basic radiation protection standards, improvements in remediation and radiation detection
technologies, decommissioning experience obtained during the past 15 years, and comments received from workshops
held as part of this rulemaking effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC presently allows decommissioning on a site-specific basis using existing guidance. However, the Commission
believes that codifying radiological criteria for decommissioning in the regulations would allow the NRC to more
effectively carry out its function of protecting public health and the environment at decommissioned sites by providing
for more efficient use of NRC and licensee resources, consistent application across all types of licenses, and a predictable
basis for decommissioning planning. In addition it would eliminate protracted delays in decommissioning which
result as licensees wait for NRC to promulgate regulatory criteria before proceeding with decommissioning of their
facilities.

Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is proposing to amend 10 CFR Part 20 of its regulations to provide specific radiological
criteria for the decommissioning of lands and structures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC is using an enhanced participatory process for developing the criteria. This process included a series of
seven workshops held from January through May 1993. The workshops were conducted at a very early stage of rulemaking
to enhance participation of interested parties and the public with the following objectives: (a) To ensure that the
relevant issues have been identified; (b) to exchange information on these issues; and (c) to identify underlying
concerns and areas of disagreement, and, where possible, approaches for resolution. In July 1993, the NRC staff also
conducted eight scoping meetings for the development of the Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) supporting
the rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed criteria would apply to the decommissioning of all facilities licensed under 10 CFR Parts 30, 40, 50,
60, 61, 70, and 72, as well as other facilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under the Atomic Energy Act
of 1954, as amended, (AEA) and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. The Commission would apply these criteria in
situations where remediation of radioactive material residues resulting from use or possession of Source, Byproduct,
and Special Nuclear Material is undertaken. For high-level and low-level waste disposal facilities (10 CFR Parts
60 and 61), the criteria would apply only to ancillary surface facilities that support radioactive waste disposal
activities because criteria for closure of the remainder of the facility and termination of the license are specified
in 10 CFR Parts 60 and 61. For uranium mills, the criteria would apply to decommissioning of the facility but not to soil
cleanup or the disposal of uranium mill tailings, which is covered in Appendix A of 10 CFR Part 40 and Environmental
Protection Agency standards in 40 CFR Part 192. The criteria would apply to decommissioning of nuclear facilities
that operate through their normal lifetime, as well as to those that may be shut down prematurely. However, they would
not apply to sites currently covered by a decommissioning plan approved by the Commission before the effective date
of this rule, if it is adopted as a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the rulemaking is to ensure that decommissioning will be carried out without undue impact on public
and occupational health and safety and the environment. The proposed amendments enhance the existing regulatory
framework by providing a clear and consistent regulatory basis for determining the extent to which lands and structures
must be remediated before a site can be decommissioned. The Commission believes that inclusion of criteria in the
regulations would result in more efficient and consistent licensing actions related to the numerous and frequently
complex site decontamination and decommissioning activities anticipated in the future. The Commission has developed
the basis for the residual contamination levels in light of changes in basic radiation protection standards, improvements
in remediation and radiation detection technologies, decommissioning experience obtained during the past 15 years,
and comments received from workshops held as part of this rulemaking effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations do not explicitly address radiological criteria for decommissioning.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The NRC presently allows decommissioning on a site-specific basis using existing guidance.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 However, the Commission believes that codifying radiological criteria for decommissioning in the regulations
would allow the NRC to more effectively carry out its function of protecting public health and the environment at decommissioned
sites by providing for more efficient use of NRC and licensee resources, consistent application across all types
of licenses, and a predictable basis for decommissioning planning. In addition, it would eliminate protracted delays
in decommissioning which result as licensees wait for NRC to promulgate regulatory criteria before proceeding with
decommissioning of their facilities.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has the statutory responsibility for protection of health and safety and
the environment related to the possession and use of source, byproduct, and special nuclear material under the AEA.
One part of NRC's responsibility is to ensure safe and timely decommissioning of the nuclear facilities that it licenses
and to provide guidance to licensees on how to plan for and prepare their sites for decommissioning. Decommissioning,
as previously defined by the NRC, means to remove nuclear facilities safely from service and to reduce residual radioactivity
to a level that permits release of the property for unrestricted use and termination of the license.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the AEA and Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the statutory responsibility
to establish generally applicable standards for protection of the public from radioactive material (i.e., outside
the NRC licensees site boundaries). The NRC is responsible for ensuring, through licensing requirements and other
restrictions, that activities at facilities under NRC jurisdiction do not lead to radiation doses outside the facility
boundaries that exceed EPA's generally applicable standards. For this reason, NRC has been coordinating closely
with EPA in the development of the proposed decommissioning standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by NRC and EPA in March 1992 provides a basic framework within which NRC
and EPA will endeavor to resolve issues of concern relating to the regulation of radionuclides in the environment.
Under the guidelines of the MOU, EPA will make a determination as to whether the proposed decommissioning standards
provide a sufficient level of protection for public health and safety and the environment. If EPA concludes that the
NRC standards are sufficient, EPA will publish its findings in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for notice and comment and propose that NRC licensees be exempt from the standards developed by EPA for non-NRC licensed
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decommissioning activities are initiated when a licensee decides to terminate licensed activities. Decommissioning
activities do not include the removal and disposal of spent fuel, which is considered to be an operational activity
or the removal and disposal of nonradioactive structures and materials beyond that necessary to terminate the NRC
license. Disposal of nonradioactive hazardous waste not necessary for NRC license termination is not covered by
these regulations but would be treated by other appropriate agencies having responsibility over these wastes. If
nuclear facilities are to be reused for nuclear purposes, applications for license renewal or amendment, or for a
new license are to be submitted according to the appropriate existing regulation. Reuse of a nuclear facility for
other nuclear purposes is not considered decommissioning because the facility remains under license. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After licensed activities have ceased, licensees are required to decommission their facilities so that their licenses
can be terminated. At present, this requires that radioactivity in land, groundwater, surface water, buildings,
and equipment resulting from the licensed operation be reduced to levels that allow the property to be released for
unrestricted use. Licensees must then demonstrate that all facilities have been properly decontaminated and that,
except for any residual radiological contamination found to be acceptable to remain at the site, radioactive material
has been transferred to authorized recipients. Confirmatory surveys are conducted by NRC, where appropriate, to
verify that sites meet NRC radiological criteria for decommissioning.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are currently about 22,000 licensees in the United States. About one-third of these are NRC licensees, while
the remainder are licensed by Agreement States through agreements entered into under Section 274 of the AEA. Licensees
include utilities, nuclear fuel fabricators, universities, medical institutions, radioactive source manufacturers,
and companies that use radioisotopes for industrial purposes. About 75 percent of NRC's 6,700 materials licensees
use either sealed radioactive sources or small amounts of short-lived radioactive materials. Sealed sources, including
items such as check sources, do not pose a contamination problem unless the encapsulation is broken. Decommissioning
of these facilities is typically simple because there is usually little or no residual radioactive contamination
to be removed and disposed of. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the remaining 25 percent, certain types of facilities (e.g., radioactive source manufacturers, radiopharmaceutical
producers, and radioactive ore processors) conduct operations which could produce substantial radioactive contamination
in portions of the facilities. At these sites, lands, facilities, or equipment may become contaminated through the
use of radioactive material in forms which have not been encapsulated to prevent the spread or dispersal of material.
When radioactive material in unsealed forms is used, such as in the nuclear fuel fabrication industry, in production
of radiopharmaceutical medicines, or in research, the equipment used to process and handle the material becomes
contaminated by the small quantities of material that adhere to surfaces of valves, piping, etc. If material is spilled,
then the area of the spill becomes contaminated. These facilities will have to be decontaminated to acceptable levels
before they can be released for unrestricted use and their licenses terminated. The population of nuclear fuel cycle
facilities which will require decommissioning includes approximately 100 nuclear power plants (at 70 sites); 50
non-power (research and test) reactors; 10 major fuel facilities (fuel fabrication and uranium hexafluoride production
plants); 50 uranium mills; and 10 independent spent fuel storage installations. It is estimated that about 1,800
other NRC-licensed facilities could require significant remediation as part of decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Essentially everything that comes in contact with radioactive material must be considered contaminated and checked
for the presence of residual radioactive material. Areas surrounding facilities could become contaminated by the
movement of materials, equipment, and people into and out of the areas containing the radioactive material. NRC requires
that contamination control procedures be used to minimize or prevent the movement of radioactive materials into
other areas. Nevertheless, some areas may become contaminated over the course of time due to breakdowns in the control
procedures. Contamination may also be spread by the movement of water or other fluids containing the radioactive
materials through or along piping, equipment, walls, floors, sumps, drains, etc. In some cases, this has resulted
in the release of significant quantities of radioactive material into the ground under or around buildings and facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to contamination, some licensed operations can produce radioactive materials through the process of
activation. In this process, materials become radioactive when they are bombarded by neutrons generated in certain
nuclear operations. Examples of such operations include nuclear reactors, where metal reinforcing bars in concrete
surrounding the reactor vessel may become radioactive through neutron bombardment. These activated materials
may also need to be removed or disposed of during decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several hundred NRC and Agreement State licenses are terminated each year. The majority of these licenses involve
limited operations, produce little or no radioactive contamination, and do not present complex decommissioning
problems or potential risks to public health or the environment from residual contamination. However, as the nuclear
industry matures, it is expected that more and more of the larger nuclear facilities that have been operating for a
number of years will reach the end of their useful lives and have to be decommissioned. Thus, both the number and complexity
of facilities that will require decommissioning are expected to increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC has a program underway to effect timely decommissioning of about 50 sites, which warrant special NRC oversight
either because they have not been decommissioned properly in the past or have been engaged in the decommissioning
process for an extended period. The Commission has established a Site Decommissioning Management Plan (SDMP), NUREG&hyph;1444,
October 1993) for effecting timely decommissioning of these problem facilities. Sites being handled under the SDMP
vary in degree of radiologic hazard, cleanup complexity, and cost. Some sites comprise tens of acres that require
assessment for radiological contamination, whereas other sites have contamination known to be limited to individual
buildings or discrete piles of tailings or contaminated soil. Many sites involve active licenses, but some sites
involve formerly licensed sites, or sites where the responsible party is unable or unwilling to perform cleanup.
These sites also vary in degree of completion of decommissioning. At some sites, little or no decontamination work
has been done; whereas at other sites, decommissioning is underway or license termination is in the offing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effort to have these SDMP sites remediated and decommissioned has been hampered in part because licensees view
the absence of definitive radiological criteria as an incentive to defer decommissioning pending issuance of formal
NRC requirements. The General Accounting Office (GAO), which has been critical of the Commission's inability to
effect timely decommissioning of these sites, has recommended that the NRC enhance its decommissioning efforts
by reconsidering its radiological criteria for decommissioning.

Until new criteria are in place, the Commission intends to proceed with decommissioning nuclear facilities on a site-specific
basis considering existing criteria coupled with the concept that residual radioactivity be as low as is reasonably
achievable (ALARA). Case and activity-specific decisions concerning decommissioning of sites will continue to
be made as necessary during the pendency of this rulemaking process. Because the SDMP sites could pose unnecessary
environmental and public risks or financial burdens if they are not decommissioned in a timely manner, the Commission's
effort to effect timely decommissioning of these sites has been proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 13, 1993, (58 FR 4099). The NRC published an Action Plan to ensure timely remediation of sites listed in the
SDMP in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13389). The NRC does not intend to require additional remediation of sites in response to criteria
established in this rulemaking, provided that the licensee or responsible party has already remediated the site
or was in the process of remediating the site in full accordance with an NRC-approved decommissioning plan at the time
of promulgation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internationally, most efforts have been focused upon development of criteria for waste disposal and recycle of radioactively
contaminated materials using guidance published by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Decommissioning criteria
have generally been established on a case-specific basis. This approach is the same as the current approach employed
in the United States pending the development of radiological criteria through formal requirements. The NRC staff
is not aware of other international efforts similar to this rulemaking to define radiological criteria for decommissioning.

The Enhanced Participatory Rulemaking Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The normal pattern for NRC rulemaking is the development of a proposed rule by the NRC staff for Commission consideration,
publication of the proposed rule for public comment, consideration of the comments by the NRC staff, and preparation
of a final rule, as appropriate, for Commission approval. As directed and approved by the Commission, the NRC staff
has enhanced participation in the early stages of this rulemaking process through a series of workshops for affected
interests. These workshops were held from January through May 1993 in Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA; Boston, MA;
Dallas, TX; Philadelphia, PA; Atlanta, GA; and Washington, DC. The workshops elicited informed discussions of options
and approaches for developing radiological criteria, and the rationale for options and approaches. While these
workshops were not designed to seek ``consensus'' in the sense that there is agreement on how each issue should be resolved,
the workshops were conducted at a very early stage of rulemaking to enhance participation of interested parties and
the public with the following objectives: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) To ensure that the relevant issues have been identified; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To exchange information on these issues; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) To identify underlying concerns and areas of disagreement, and, where possible, approaches for resolution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission hopes that the interactions among the participants in the workshop environment also fostered a clearer
mutual understanding of the positions and concerns of all participants. These workshops provided a number of themes,
such as consideration of restricted use options, increased public participation in the site decommissioning process,
and a desire to return sites to levels indistinguishable from natural background, that form the basis upon which the
Commission has developed the provisions of this rulemaking. Comments made at these ``Scoping Meetings,'' the workshops,
and related written comments were considered by the NRC staff in its preparation of a staff draft rule as described
in the paragraph below. Comments were also used, as appropriate, in developing the Draft Generic Environmental Impact
Statement (GEIS) for the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission approved an additional opportunity for enhanced participation at an early stage of the rule development.
Copies of the NRC staff's draft rule and summaries of comments received from workshop participants, NUREG/CR&hyph;6156,
were sent to NRC Agreement States, workshop participants, and other interested parties on January 27, 1994. A notice
of availability of these documents was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and the documents were placed on the electronic bulletin board on February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4868). The intent of this
informal comment period in advance of a proposed rule was to provide an opportunity for interested parties to comment
on the adequacy of the draft criteria and the extent to which the criteria have considered the range of viewpoints expressed
during the workshops and scoping meetings. The comment period ended on March 11, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concurrent with the NRC rulemaking on radiological criteria for decommissioning, the EPA is proceeding to develop
standards and guidance for Federal agencies in the area of radiation protection, including standards for the cleanup
of contaminated sites. The EPA National Advisory Council on Environmental Policy and Technology and the Subcommittee
on Residual Radioactivity held public meetings in October 1993, February 1994, and May 1994 to discuss the issues
associated with the EPA rulemaking. The NRC and EPA have coordinated their efforts in this area in order to ensure that
effective and consistent site cleanup standards are established while minimizing duplication of effort. Accordingly,
the EPA was an important participant in the NRC rulemaking workshops and is a cooperating agency in the preparation
of the GEIS for the rulemaking. The NRC has also consulted extensively with EPA throughout the rulemaking process.
It is anticipated that the information gathered during the workshops on the NRC standards will also be relevant and
useful to the EPA efforts in the area of site cleanup standards. The objective of the NRC and EPA cooperative efforts
is to attempt to reach an agreement that the NRC standards established in the enhanced participatory rulemaking are
sufficient to provide adequate protection to the public health and safety for NRC-licensed sites. The EPA efforts
could then focus on the site clean-up standards for non-NRC licensed sites, such as DOE and DOD facilities. This is
consistent with the principles and procedures set forth in a Memorandum of Understanding between the NRC and EPA published
on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54127), to guide each agency's actions in areas of mutual regulatory concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The next two sections of this notice summarize the comments from the workshops and the comments on the NRC staff draft
rule. The purpose of these summaries is to document the public comments and the NRC response to these comments, and
to show how the NRC approach to the rulemaking has evolved as a result of public participation in the rulemaking process.

NRC held rulemaking workshops in Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA; Boston, MA; Dallas, TX; Philadelphia, PA; Atlanta,
GA; and Washington, DC between January and May 1993. The workshop comments have been summarized in NUREG/CR&hyph;6156,
``Summary of Comments Received from Workshops on Radiation Criteria for Decommissioning.'' This report summarizes
3,635 comments categorized from transcripts of the seven workshops and 1,677 comments from 100 NRC docketed letters
from individuals and organizations. NUREG/CR&hyph;6156 merely catalogues the comments and viewpoints; no analysis
or response to the comments is included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments reflect a broad spectrum of viewpoints on the issues related to radiological criteria for decommissioning
and associated subjects. The comments show little evidence of general agreement on issues except that most parties
appear to agree that (1) the rulemaking should proceed and (2) the Commission's activities in decommissioning should
recognize that it is not reasonable to expect all nuclear facilities to be remediated to a level that permits termination
of the license and release of the facility for unrestricted use. While a number of additional themes emerged from the
workshops, these themes cannot be characterized as having the general agreement of all of the workshop and meeting
participants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Almost all commenters supported the NRC's plans to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiological decommissioning standards and recommended that the rulemaking go forward expeditiously. Some commenters
recommended that the NRC consider and possibly establish both radiological and chemical decommissioning standards.
Most commenters stated that the NRC should establish standards for both unrestricted and restricted release of sites.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC is proceeding with a rulemaking which will establish radiological criteria for decommissioning. NRC's schedule
calls for issuance of a final rule by May 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC's authority is limited by law primarily to ensuring protection of the public health and safety from radiological
and nuclear hazards associated with source, special nuclear, and byproduct material. NRC has refrained from extending
its reach to address non-radiological hazards except where specifically authorized by Congress (e.g., uranium
mill tailings) or where these hazards would not otherwise be adequately controlled because of a regulatory void.
Consequently, NRC is not proposing to include provisions in the radiological criteria to address non-radiological
hazards. Although the rule would not establish criteria for disposition of nonradioactive hazardous and other wastes,
licensees are reminded that they must continue to meet applicable Federal, State, and local standards for disposition
of these wastes. The proposed rule provides for both unrestricted release and restricted termination of the license.
If a licensee cannot satisfy the conditions for license termination, the license will not be terminated.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters recommended that NRC decommissioning standards be based on and be consistent with the scientific
information and advice of such organizations as the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP)
and the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). One commenter suggested that the NRC should
determine whether the standards are to be technologically-based or politically-based; if the latter, do not waste
time on technological input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It should be noted that the NRC and its predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, have generally followed
the basic radiation protection recommendations of the ICRP; its U.S. counterpart, the NCRP; and the EPA Draft Federal
Radiation Protection Guidance for Exposure to the General public in formulating basic radiation protection standards.
Recommendations of the ICRP and the NCRP were relied on in the revised ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation,''
which was published May 21, 1991 (56 FR 233360), and implemented by licensees on or before January 1, 1994. The proposed
radiological criteria for decommissioning continues this practice but the proposed rule also recognizes the public's
interest in and potential for contributing to the decommissioning process. The public's involvement through participating
in the development of the criteria in this rulemaking, opportunities for review of decommissioning plans, as well
as through participation on Site-Specific Advisory Boards as specified in this rule are expected to aid in the conduct
of a decommissioning program that is understandable, technologically sound, and responsive to the concerns of affected
parties.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters recommended that the NRC consider adopting a risk limit standard equating to a radiation dose
of 25 to 100 millirem per year. According to two commenters, a 100 millirem per year limit would increase the cancer
risk in the population only slightly above its normal incidence rate. One commenter believes that radiation damage
per unit of exposure may increase at smaller doses. Other commenters stated that there may be a threshold for radiation
effects and that there may be no adverse health effects at low radiation levels.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Supplementary Information for the revised ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation,'' the NRC stated
that the standards are based upon the assumptions that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Within the range of exposure conditions usually encountered in radiation work, there is a linear relationship,
without threshold, between dose and probability of occurrence of stochastic (random) health effects such as latent
cancer and genetic effects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The severity of each type of stochastic health effect is independent of dose; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Nonstochastic (nonrandom) radiation-induced health effects can be prevented by limiting exposures so that
doses are below the thresholds for their induction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the absence of convincing evidence that there is a dose threshold or that low levels of radiation are beneficial,
the staff believes that the assumptions regarding a linear nonthreshold dose-effect model for cancers and genetic
effects and the existence of thresholds only for certain nonstochastic effects are prudent for formulating radiation
protection standards and planning radiation protection programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff believes the dose limits and ALARA requirements of the proposed radiological criteria for decommissioning
provide a reasonable basis for protection of public health and safety and the environment. However, the staff has
also determined that decommissioning activities should not be allowed the entire dose limit of 100 mrem/y for members
of the public. The staff has selected a value which is a relatively small fraction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit, consistent with other decisions of both the EPA and NRC for unrestricted access to areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters recommended that the NRC establish a risk/dose limit on the order of the variability of natural background
radiation occurring across the United States as its decommissioning standard. The reasons given were that no health
risks are attributable to background radiation variations and studies show that there is no increase in cancer incidence
over a wide range of background radiation in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff believes that the overall objective for decommissioning should be the return of the facility to levels
approximating background. However, the NRC staff recognizes that demonstrating that radioisotope levels at a site
are indistinguishable from background will be a complex task involving sophisticated sampling, measuring, and
statistical analysis techniques. The NRC staff also recognizes that the difficulty of the task can vary substantially
depending on a number of factors including the radionuclide in question, the background level for that and other radionuclides
at the site, and the temporal and spatial variations in background radiation at the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in the draft rule, the NRC staff proposed as a goal of the ALARA process that the Total Effective Dose Equivalent
(TEDE) to the average member of the Critical Group from all radionuclides that could contribute to residual radioactivity
and are distinguishable from background not exceed 3 mrem (0.03 mSv) per year. Demonstration of achieving this dose
criterion would be considered as the only demonstration necessary to meet the proposed ALARA requirements of the
rule. One of the reasons 3 millirem per year was selected is because variations of this magnitude typically are not
distinguishable from the variation of dose from background radiation. Three mrem/y is well within the variability
of natural background radiation across the U.S. and also within those variations experienced seasonally at particular
sites. Based upon comments received on the NRC staff draft, the Commission has decided to remove the 3 millirem per
year value from the proposed rule (see discussion under ``Comments on NRC Staff Draft'').

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were made concerning how risk standards should be applied to the population who may be exposed to
residual radioactivity at a released site. Most commenters favored applying a risk limit to individuals and believed
it unnecessary to specify a collective dose limit (i.e., a limit on the cumulative dose in person-rem/y to the entire
exposed population). One commenter remarked that if collective dose is used, it should be applied in a comprehensive
manner. For example, in evaluating an appropriate cleanup standard, the doses to the public from transporting material
off site for disposal should be evaluated against the doses received by the public around the site if the material is
left in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has considered both the collective doses to populations and the individual doses to the average member of the
most highly exposed group of individuals (Critical Group). These considerations are reflected in the calculations
presented in the GEIS prepared in support of this rulemaking. In the scenarios considered, the annual collective
dose is quite small. Therefore, the staff concludes that limiting individual dose to the levels specified in the criteria
will assure that collective doses will be small and that the public health will be adequately protected. This is consistent
with past Commission practice in establishing radiological criteria.

4. Statement of Radiological Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing the staff's draft rule, attention was focused on four approaches: (1) establish an annual risk or dose
limit for an individual, (2) establish an annual risk or dose goal, (3) require use of best available technology, and
(4) require return of the site to background radioactivity.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most commenters from State governments, the nuclear utilities, the fuel cycle industry, the medical community and
non-fuel cycle industry, cleanup contractors, and professional society/standard setting organizations favored
a risk-based or dose-based standard over a standard based on best available technology or return to background. Most
commenters from citizen/environmental organizations and some from other organizations favored a return-to-background
standard. Many commenters objected to a best effort/best available technology standard for various reasons including
the belief that it would be extremely subjective.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule would establish a dose limit for release of the site of 15 millirem per year (mrem/y) TEDE for residual
radioactivity distinguishable from background and require that the licensee reduce this residual radioactivity
to ALARA. Sites meeting this criterion would be considered acceptable for release for unrestricted use and termination
of the license. Fifteen mrem/y TEDE is consistent in terms of risk with the NRC release limits for low-level waste facilities
(10 CFR 61.41), is consistent with the individual dose protection limit in the EPA Environmental Radiation Protection
Standards for the Management and Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel, High-level and Transuranic Wastes, 40 CFR Part 191
(December 20, 1993; 58 FR 66398), and provides a substantial safety margin below the NRC's 100 mrem/y dose limit for
individual members of the public. Use of a dose limit is consistent with long standing NRC (and AEC) regulatory practices
for protecting radiation workers and the public. The use of a limit also provides a clear measure for determining the
acceptability of a site and a clear basis for determinations of compliance with the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff agrees that the objective of decommissioning should be to reduce residual radioactivity at a site to
levels that are indistinguishable from background. Therefore, the draft rule proposed to establish the following
goal for decommissioning within the structure of reducing exposure below the limit to as low as reasonably achievable:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reduce the concentration of individual radionuclides which could contribute to residual radioactivity at the
site to a level which is indistinguishable from background;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Release the site for unrestricted use; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Terminate the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of determining when further ALARA efforts need not be further analyzed and documented, the Commission
would consider that the ALARA requirement has been met if the TEDE to the average member of the critical group from all
radionuclides that could contribute to residual radioactivity and are distinguishable from background does not
exceed 3 mrem (0.03 mSv) per year. Three millirem per year is a small fraction of the NRC's 100 mrem/y dose limit for individual
members of the public, typically is not distinguishable from variations in local and national radiation background
levels, and is consistent with the 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 level of lifetime risk used by EPA for Superfund. Dose based criteria were selected over risk based criteria for ease
of implementation. Based upon comments received on the NRC staff draft, the Commission has decided to remove the numerical
values of 3 millirem per year from the proposed rule. However, the Commission remains committed to the objective of
decommissioning to levels that are indistinguishable from background.

 Many commenters urged that all regulatory agencies (EPA, NRC, State and local governments, etc.) use the same radiological
criteria for decommissioning and that the agencies be consistent in how they apply the criteria. Some commenters
said that the NRC's adoption of a risk/dose limit of 100 millirem per year, with a proper application of ALARA, would
result in a 10

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC is hopeful that the proposed criteria developed through the enhanced participatory rulemaking process will
be acceptable to all regulatory agencies and will be consistent and compatible with the requirements of other regulatory
agencies. The EPA and NRC have overlapping authority in the area of developing radiological criteria for decommissioning
for nuclear sites. In addition, decommissioned sites, if not remediated properly, could later be subject to remedial
action under EPA Superfund requirements. This is an outcome which is viewed as undesirable by both the EPA and NRC and
is considered unlikely because the proposed NRC criteria are designed to be consistent with the risk range incorporated
in EPA's Superfund requirements. NRC and EPA are developing decommissioning criteria in parallel rulemaking efforts.
The NRC and EPA are coordinating their efforts in this area to ensure that effective and consistent site decommissioning
standards are established while minimizing duplication of effort. Accordingly, the EPA was an important participant
in the NRC rulemaking workshops and is a cooperating agency in the preparation of the GEIS for the rulemaking. The NRC
has also consulted extensively with EPA throughout the rulemaking process. The objective is that EPA will be able
to make a finding that NRC decommissioning criteria provide adequate protection for the public and the environment
and will exclude NRC licensees from the EPA cleanup standards. In addition, State and local governments will have
opportunities to participate in certain individual decommissioning actions carried out under the proposed regulation.
Further discussion on participation may be found in item 7, below. Agreement State compatibility is discussed briefly
in a separate section near the end of this supplementary information.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters stated that the NRC's decommissioning standard should be long-lasting and provide a final solution
for decommissioning sites that are contaminated with radioactive material. The NRC's standard should be consistent
with EPA rules to assure that a site remediated under NRC's rules will not require further remediation under EPA rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters questioned whether it is possible to have finality in decommissioning standards because of likely
new information and improved technology in the future. They stated that sites should continue to be remediated as
necessary to meet new standards. Those opposed stated that rules should be changed only if a substantial increase
in public safety can be demonstrated.

 The NRC staff believes that actions taken under the criteria in this rule need not be revisited unless, based on new
information, there is reason to believe that residual radioactivity remaining at the site could result in significant
public risk. Therefore, once a site has been decommissioned and the license terminated in accordance with the criteria
in the rule, the Commission would require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it determines the
level of residual radioactivity at the site substantially violates these criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the NRC's experience in the SDMP and other decommissioning programs, it is important to provide a high level
of assurance that decommissioning actions conducted under the current criteria will not need to be revisited in the
future under potentially more restrictive criteria. Licensees have indicated a genuine reluctance to commit the
large financial and corporate resources necessary for complex decommissioning projects without these assurances.
Uncertainty with future criteria and the potential need for additional remediation introduces havoc in the planning
and conduct of effective decommissioning. Without some degree of finality in the criteria, licensees may be motivated
to forestall decommissioning actions pending development of more favorable criteria or less expensive decommissioning
technologies and waste disposal options. This approach manifests itself in extended administrative appeals and
litigation, which often redirects licensee resources away from efforts to reduce levels of contamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, the NRC recognizes that there may be legitimate needs for additional remedial actions in the future
if significant additional contamination is discovered at a site or if the technical basis on which the criteria are
founded changes significantly, indicating that potential future residents of the sites may be at significantly
greater risk than previously anticipated. Therefore, the proposed criteria allow for additional remediation,
if necessary, if additional significant contamination is identified or if changes in the risk or health basis for
the criteria indicate the remediation is necessary to protect the public against significant radiological risks.

As noted in item 5, the EPA and NRC are working together closely in this rulemaking. Upon completion, the EPA will determine
through a formal notice and comment rulemaking whether the NRC's rule provides adequate protection for public health
and the environment. This should minimize the risk that in the future the EPA would require additional cleanup of a
site which has been decommissioned in accordance with the criteria in this rule.

 Many commenters recommended that the rulemaking should provide for and ensure local citizen group participation

 The NRC staff believes it is important for the public to not only be fully informed of the decommissioning actions at
a particular site but also to be able to effectively participate in site decommissioning decisions. The proposed
rule provides specific mechanisms for public participation in the decommissioning process, where participation
is important to ensuring that the public is adequately informed about proposed decommissioning activities or that
the public and environment are adequately protected in conjunction with reliance on institutional controls to restrict
site access after license termination. These activities are in addition to whatever hearing opportunities are provided
for a particular category of site by the Commission's existing requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon the receipt of a decommissioning plan from the licensee, or a proposal by the licensee for restricted release
of a site, or whenever the Commission deems such a notice to be in the public interest, the Commission will:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notify local and State governments in the vicinity of the site and Indian Nation or other indigenous people that
have treaty or statutory rights that could be affected by the decommissioning;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as well as in other media, such as local newspapers, which are readily accessible to individuals in the vicinity of
the site; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Solicit public comment on the proposed decommissioning action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For decommissioning actions where the licensee proposes to request license termination with land use restrictions,
the licensee will be required to convene a Site Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) for the purpose of obtaining advice
from affected parties regarding the proposed decommissioning. The SSAB will function at the planning stages of decommissioning,
at the time the licensee is developing the decommissioning plan for the facility. The purpose of the SSAB is to provide
recommendations to the licensee on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether there are ways to reduce residual radioactivity to the levels that will permit release for unrestricted
use which are technically achievable, will not be prohibitively expensive, and will not result in net public or environmental
harm;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether provisions for institutional controls proposed by the licensee will:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Provide reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to
the average member of the Critical Group will not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE per year,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Be enforceable,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Impose undue burdens on the local community or other affected parties; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether the licensee has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume
and carry out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters stated that NRC decommissioning standards are needed to facilitate long-term planning by the
nuclear industry and to provide stability against constantly changing criteria over the years. Some commenters
stated that even generic standards may not be completely stable because they will need to be changed as a result of newly
perceived health effects and improvements in technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters indicated that the rule must be flexible enough to accommodate site differences, e.g., types of radionuclides
present, the geology and environmental surroundings, individuals who may be exposed, and possible exposure patterns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters favored a generic standard over site-specific standards. While supporting the establishment of
a generic standard, some urged the NRC to permit site-specific considerations and site-specific modeling for licensees
to demonstrate compliance and to ensure participation by local communities. One commenter stated it would be a mistake
to use a generic ALARA evaluation for all sites. Several commenters recommended site-specific ALARA assessments.
Some commenters, particularly in the GEIS scoping meetings, suggested that the rule only provide the process for
establishing site-specific criteria.

Response.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The staff agrees that there is a need for consistent and stable radiological criteria for the decommissioning of licensed
nuclear facilities throughout the United States. Therefore, this rulemaking would establish a single set of radiological
criteria that would apply to the decommissioning of all sites. However, the staff also recognizes the need for flexibility
in applying these criteria because of constraints posed by site specific conditions (e.g. geology, hydrology, meteorology,
and radiation background levels) and to provide opportunity for meaningful participation by local communities
in individual decommissioning actions. Therefore, the rule proposed by the staff provides for site-specific implementation
of the generic criteria. The Commission would also publish regulatory guidance along with the rule that describes
methods for site-specific implementation of the criteria. This guidance includes conduct of site characterization
and surveys, specific radionuclide concentration and surface activities that would be considered by the NRC staff
to meet the decommissioning limit, and modeling acceptable to the NRC staff to develop more site-specific values
of concentration or surface activity based upon the factors unique to the activity being decommissioned. In this
regard, the NRC is working with the EPA and the DOE to develop a Federal Government manual for the conduct of surveys
to determine compliance with decommissioning criteria. When completed, this effort will assist in the consistent
treatment of all sites requiring remediation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff believes that generic criteria should be established for decommissioning and that codifying radiological
criteria for decommissioning in the regulations would:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Allow the NRC to more effectively assure protection of public health and the environment at decommissioned sites;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Result in more efficient use of NRC and licensee resources;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Lead to more consistent and uniform application across all types of licenses;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Provide a more stable basis for decommissioning planning; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Eliminate protracted delays in decommissioning that result as licensees wait for generic regulatory criteria
before proceeding with decommissioning of their facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC does not favor the option suggested of providing a process based rule whereby the criteria codified would only
be for the process to be used in establishing site-specific radiological criteria. This approach would be essentially
the same as the option of remaining with the current 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
status quo.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, a site-specific approach can lead to considerable delays and increased uncertainty on the part of all
parties associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decommissioning. Further, this approach would be inappropriate and burdensome for the large number of licensees
using sealed sources or radionuclides with relatively short half-lives.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the ALARA concept, decommissioning activities are continued beyond meeting applicable risk/dose limits
in efforts to reduce radiation exposures As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA). Most commenters recommended that
the NRC's radiological criteria should incorporate this principle. Several commenters stated that State and local
governments should be involved in ALARA determinations. However, other commenters expressed distrust of the licensees'
and regulatory agencies' application of the ALARA process because it involves financial tradeoffs and licensees
are motivated to maximize their profits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule requires application of the ALARA concept, provided that potential doses are constrained within
limiting doses under a range of conditions. NRC anticipates that many licensees, particularly sealed source users
or those who use relatively short-lived radioactive materials, will be able to satisfy the ALARA criteria with an
analysis of projected dose levels. In these cases, extensive additional documentation to support an ALARA determination
would not be required. State and local governments and other affected parties will be involved in ALARA determinations
through opportunities to comment on decommissioning proposals and participation on the Site-Specific Advisory
Board in those cases where the licensee is seeking license termination under restricted conditions. This level of
involvement provides for transparent application of the ALARA considerations and safeguards against excessive
licensee attention to cutting costs to maintain profit margins.

 Many commenters stated that for the most effective use of resources and fairness, the NRC must consider in the risk-benefit
balance not only radiological risks to workers and the public but, also, non-radiological risks and indirect risks
associated with the regulation of decommissioning activities.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The staff agrees that all significant public and environmental risks should be considered. The GEIS for this rulemaking
assesses both radiological and non-radiological impacts for the proposed rule and several alternative actions,
including the alternative of no remedial action. In addition, the proposed rule would require that the licensee,
when determining ALARA for a specific decommissioning, consider all significant radiological and non-radiological
risks resulting from residual radioactivity and from the decommissioning process itself (including transportation
and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the process).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, the necessary ALARA analysis will go beyond the relatively simple cost-benefit analysis that has typically
been applied in the nuclear industry in limiting worker exposures because the types of risks being considered are
not things that can be easily quantified or compared. For example, transportation poses immediate risks in terms
of fatalities due to highway accidents in hauling the radioactive contamination to appropriate disposal sites.
Some individuals and organizations have suggested that these anticipated fatalities should not be considered as
having the same seriousness or likelihood as the potential deaths at some point in the future of individuals that may
inhabit former nuclear sites after license termination. ALARA, or perceptions of what should be considered as ALARA,
may also vary because of values placed on minimizing the number of new disposal sites, preserving existing resources,
or preserving viable industries for jobs. Each of these factors were discussed in the workshops, and the staff believes
that these same factors may need to be considered in determining the ALARA level for remediation at a particular site.
The NRC is developing guidance on how the ALARA process could be applied in evaluating alternative radiological criteria
for decommissioning on a site-specific basis.

 The NRC staff agrees with this stated conclusion that, as a guiding principle, radiation protection standards do
not warrant different treatment than those for other health issues. In this regard, the staff has carefully considered
both the criteria and the implementation of those criteria in other environmental remediation programs (e.g., the
EPA Superfund program). The staff believes the criteria proposed in this rulemaking are generally consistent with
those used in other environmental remediation programs.

 Several commenters stated that cleaning up to any specified level is technically achievable and is simply a matter
of how much it will cost. Some believed that decommissioning costs to return sites to unrestricted use could be so high
that the sites should be kept under continued control and maintained as a restricted area. Some commenters suggested
that money saved on unnecessary decommissioning activities might be used in other activities more beneficial to
the public. Other commenters stated that money saved on decommissioning costs would not necessarily be available
for societal betterment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule recognizes that it may not be reasonable to remediate some sites to a level that permits release for
unrestricted use. The costs involved, either in dollars or in potential harm to the environment or people, may be prohibitive.
In these cases, the proposed rule provides for termination of the license under restricted conditions. The staff
is also aware that in some unusual cases sites may have to remain under license indefinitely. For example, the NRC is
aware of certain sites that are so contaminated by elevated levels of the naturally occurring radionuclides uranium,
thorium, and their decay products that it would be extremely difficult and costly to satisfy the proposed criteria
for unrestricted or restricted release. In these cases, the staff anticipates that the sites would have to remain
under a license indefinitely until new, more efficient technologies are developed or the financial resources become
available to pay for more complete remediation. The Commission has no authority over expenditure of funds that might
be saved by avoiding what were termed ``unnecessary decommissioning activities.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters stated that, although the cost of decommissioning could be high, remediation technologies are
available for achieving whatever level is set by the NRC. The NRC should describe acceptable methodologies for remediation
and measurement to reduce subjective judgments and should ensure that workers who perform remediation are appropriately
trained and protected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Before the effective date of the final rule, the NRC will provide interim guidance for use and comment on acceptable
methodologies for demonstrating compliance with the Commission's residual radioactivity criteria. After one
to two years' implementation experience is gained from use of the interim guidance, the collected comments will be
addressed and the final guidance will be issued. However, the NRC staff does not believe that it would be appropriate
to prescribe, a priori, the methods to be used. Licensees must be able to take advantage of whatever safe methodologies
may be available for achieving remediation that complies with the criteria for decommissioning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workers performing decommissioning must receive training in radiation protection according to the requirements
of the Commission's requirements in 10 CFR 19.12, ``Instructions to Workers.'' Likewise, workers participating
in decommissioning activities will be subject to all of the provisions of 10 CFR Part 20, including requirements related
to personnel monitoring, respiratory protection, occupational dose limits, and ALARA. In this regard, the staff
does not view the conduct of decommissioning activities to be any different from other operational activities licensed
by the Commission.

 Several commenters stated that demonstration of compliance with NRC decommissioning rules and applicable radiological
limits is a major issue. The commenters believe the NRC must provide clear guidelines with respect to the kinds of measurements
that are necessary and the models that are acceptable to demonstrate compliance. With respect to measurements, guidance
should cover:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to models and methodologies, guidance should be provided on their use, uncertainties, and how to apply
site-specific characteristics. The NRC must make sufficient confirmatory measurements to check that the standards
have been met and NRC should enforce the standards.

Several commenters pointed out that, whatever risk standard the NRC may adopt, compliance will likely need to be determined
by a computer model except for small operations when contamination levels are within specified generic criteria.
Other commenters stated that decontamination limits should be established and dose modeling should not be relied
on to demonstrate compliance. Comments were split on whether risk limits might be needed for different exposure pathways.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Before the effective date of the final rule, NRC plans to issue specific guidance that includes conservative radiation
levels, surface contamination limits, and radioactivity concentrations for use by licensees who elect to apply
a generic model to demonstrate compliance. Guidance on measurements covering the above listed five subjects will
also be provided. The NRC appreciates that guidance is essential especially where the licensee must demonstrate
compliance with criteria that require reduction of residual radioactivity to near background levels. The NRC expects
to make sufficient confirmatory measurements to ensure compliance with the criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule limits the total exposure from all pathways and, except for the purpose of groundwater protection,
does not set limits for individual pathways. The groundwater protection requirement has been included at the request
of the EPA to ensure conformance with EPA groundwater protection requirements. Because exposure pathways vary in
importance to public dose depending on the radioisotope involved, site-specific parameters, and the circumstances
under which the site might be used after decommissioning, the staff believes that, as a general rule, no useful purpose
would be served by placing limits on individual pathways. In the selection of conservative default values for use
by licensees who do not wish to utilize site-specific modeling, the most critical pathways and scenarios of exposure
are assumed to be dominant. The absence of limits on individual pathways provides the licensee with more flexibility
in limiting radiation exposures while at the same time providing adequate overall public protection.

Many commenters stated that the NRC should establish standards for both unrestricted and restricted release of sites
while others recommended that the NRC require all sites to be remediated suitably for unrestricted use. Some commenters
stated that sites should continue to be licensed by the NRC if they cannot be reasonably decontaminated. Also, commenters
stated that the NRC should consider the option of restricted future use of decommissioned facilities only after a
rigorous public participation process. Many commenters stated that unrestricted release should be the goal,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provides for both unrestricted release and restricted termination of the license under prescribed
conditions. The requirement that the licensee convene a Site-Specific Advisory Board early in the development of
proposed decommissioning plans should help ensure substantive public participation in decisions concerning possible
restricted termination of the license. As previously discussed, the staff is aware of sites, such as sites with significant
volumes of thorium contamination, that will require extensively remedial efforts to achieve the proposed requirements
for restricted or unrestricted release. If these sites cannot be remediated to achieve at least the restricted release
criteria, then the site license will remain in effect indefinitely until technology or resources become available
to achieve compliance with the criteria. In the interim period, NRC will ensure appropriate control of the licensed
site on a site-specific basis, including access restrictions, environmental monitoring, personnel monitoring,
posting, mitigative actions, and other measures directed at ensuring the stability of the radioactive material
and protection of the public health and the environment.

Several commenters questioned whether there is enough space at a regional disposal facility for the voluminous soils
and other materials that are expected from decommissioned sites. Other commenters stated that irrespective of where
or how wastes are disposed, the costs of nuclear waste management will be high. Some commenters suggested that the
option of leaving radioactive wastes on-site should be considered as a temporary or intermediate option to permit
decay of radioactive wastes and allow time for resolving long-term waste disposal problems.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff recognizes that decommissioning to radiation levels approaching background may produce large volumes
of low-level waste which could affect the availability of regional disposal capacity. However, the proposed rule
would require the licensee to consider significant radiation doses and risks resulting from transportation and
disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the decommissioning process when determining ALARA for a specific decommissioning
action. If disposal capacity were to become temporarily limited, on-site storage and containment of wastes may be
necessary until a disposal site becomes available. However, any temporary onsite storage and containment of radioactive
wastes be done under the provisions of an existing NRC license, and the site would not be decommissioned until this
waste had been removed from the site. The radiological and non-radiological impacts associated with disposal of
the types of radioactive waste generated in decommissioning were considered in NRC's development of the Environmental
Impact Statement in support of the low-level waste disposal requirements in 10 CFR Part 61. Impacts associated with
extended storage of waste onsite or at a centralized storage facility would typically be considered as part of environmental
analysis in support of issuing or renewing facility licenses or of approving decommissioning actions at a licensed
facility.

Many commenters recommended that the NRC discourage or stop licensing nuclear operations that generate nuclear
wastes. Several commenters stated that environmental organizations would be willing to talk about ways to decommission
nuclear operations and to dispose of radioactive materials only if power plants were no longer permitted to operate.
Other commenters supported the continuation of nuclear power. One commenter urged the NRC not to take sides for or
against nuclear power and stated that the policy debate on the relative merits of various power-generating options
should be held in another forum (e.g., Congress). Some commenters observed that high costs of decommissioning and
waste disposal could help to minimize waste generation. Some commenters recommended that the rulemaking should
deal with source reduction of nuclear wastes. Some commenters suggested that decommissioning proposals should
be submitted and approved at the design stage and, consequently, newer facilities should be easier to decommission.

The NRC agrees that newly licensed facilities should be encouraged in designing and operating nuclear facilities
to minimize the generation of radioactive waste and facility contamination. The proposed rule would require applicants
for licenses, other than renewals, after the effective date of the rule to describe in the application how facility
design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the facility and the environment, facilitate
eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive waste.

Many commenters recommended that the NRC should impose limits to control exposure from radon emissions at decommissioned
sites because radon exposures could be a significant health problem. Commenters in favor of NRC setting a radon standard
stated it should be possible to make a good estimate of how much radon comes from licensed material. Commenters not
supporting the NRC's setting a radon standard stated that the need to deal with radon at licensed sites should be considered
site-to-site and that radon control should be left to local zoning boards and housing authorities.

The NRC staff believes that it is not possible to measure or distinguish concentrations of radon which will produce

(3) Limitations of existing measurement techniques in distinguishing between elevated radon concentrations and
radon attributed to natural sources. Therefore, the staff does not propose to establish a separate standard for radon.
Instead, exposure to radon at decommissioned sites would be controlled by requiring the licensee to reduce the residual
concentrations of radon precursors like uranium, thorium, and radium to levels within the limit for unrestricted
use and, using the ALARA principle, toward levels which are indistinguishable from background levels.

Many commenters recommended that the NRC develop standards for protecting natural ecosystems in addition to standards
protecting humans. Others expressed concern for environmental protection without recommending for or against
establishing separate environmental standards. A large number of commenters recommended that protection of human
health is sufficient to protect any known ecological system. Therefore, only a standard for protecting humans is
needed. Commenters stated that this is the view of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters recommended that case-by-case consideration should be given for special environmental and social/cultural
issues associated with homeland, historical sites, and Native American lands because they contain religious sites
and sacred areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters cautioned against establishment of unnecessarily restrictive decommissioning standards
that could cause severe environmental damage trying to clean up soil and vegetation to background levels because
these actions could totally change a site's ecology.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC considered the possible need for radiation standards specifically designed to protect the environment.
This analysis is reflected in the draft GEIS. Based on this analysis, the staff concludes that the radiological criteria
in the proposed rule which are designed to protect public health should also provide adequate environmental protection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the NRC staff recognizes there may be environmental or cultural issues associated with a particular decommissioning
action which require special consideration. These issues can best be handled on a site-by-site basis as part on the
decommissioning plan review process and as part of the Commission's environmental review under the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA). Where necessary, opportunity for public comment and use of the Site-Specific Advisory Board will
provide a mechanism for local citizens and other affected parties to be directly involved in addressing these issues.

Comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were offered for and against whether NRC should permit recycling of contaminated materials. Those in favor
recommended recycling to save resources. Those opposed recommended against recycling to limit public risk. Other
commenters stated that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recommended that the maximum dose to any
individual from recycled material not exceed one millirem per year.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the proposed rule does not specifically address recycle, the NRC staff believes the radiological criteria
in the proposed rule provide reasonable assurance that future inadvertent recycle of soils or structures following
decommissioning of a site will not adversely affect public health. The analysis which supports the rule, although
it does not specifically take recycle into account, is based on prudently conservative scenarios which tend to overestimate
expected public doses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases where the licensee achieves residual radioactivity levels that are indistinguishable from background,
the potential doses from inadvertent recycle are expected to be insignificant. In cases where the residual radioactivity
cannot be reduced to the point that it is indistinguishable from background, the licensee will have to consider inadvertent
recycle when conducting the ALARA analysis for the site. Therefore, steps can be taken on a site-specific basis to
impose additional restrictions if inadvertent recycle appears to pose a significant potential problem at that site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission plans to consider separately the issues of how to deal with cases where the licensee proposes to release
material containing residual radioactivity intentionally for reuse or recycle either as a part of decommissioning
or ongoing operations. In the interim the Commission will continue to be review these actions on a case-by-case basis.

Overview of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were 1685 comments from the 89 docketed letters received on the NRC staff draft. These comments were similar
to those from the workshops with respect to the wide range of expressed views. Two subjects on which the commenters
were in general agreement were (1) the appropriateness of the rulemaking process, and (2) the significance of not
having the GEIS and the guidance documents available for review. The commenters strongly favor the enhanced participatory
rulemaking process but said that the GEIS and the guidance documents are needed in order to understand the basis for
the rule and how it would be implemented. The NRC staff considered these comments in the development of the proposed
rule.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters supported the NRC's efforts to develop radiological decommissioning standards. However, some questioned
whether the NRC should defer to the EPA and suggested that the NRC await the EPA's efforts to develop these standards.
Several commenters urged that the NRC reconsider and delete the exclusion of previously approved decommissioning
plans from the new requirements. Others recommended retention of this exclusion and its expansion to cover decommissioning
plans already in the final stages of NRC review and approval. A comment reported often was that the NRC should issue
its proposed radiological criteria for final public review and comment only after the NRC has completed and issued
the companion GEIS and other guidance documents needed to facilitate understanding of the proposed rulemaking.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the question of whether the NRC should let the EPA take the lead in developing radiological decommissioning
standards, the NRC will have to proceed with rulemaking in any case. If EPA develops standards, the NRC will have to
promulgate a regulation to implement the EPA standard. Therefore, it was jointly decided that parallel NRC/EPA efforts
would be the best approach. The NRC has worked closely with the EPA and will continue to do so. As a result of this interactive
cooperation, progress has been made that would have been unlikely otherwise. It is believed important that both agencies
continue to work on this effort (see discussion under Item 4, Consistency and Compatibility). With respect to previously
approved decommissioning plans, the Commission believes it is important to encourage licensees to take timely decommissioning
actions. Accordingly, the Commission is retaining the exclusion of previously approved decommissioning plans
in the new requirements and is expanding the provisions to include plans under final stages of NRC review. Regarding
the need for public review of the GEIS and other guidance documents, the Commission fully agrees. The GEIS, a regulatory
analysis (RA), and an NRC staff working draft regulatory guide will be issued concurrently with publication of the
proposed rulemaking. The formal comment period for the rulemaking will commence with this

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were divided concerning whether NRC decommissioning standards should be based on the recommendations
of recognized national and international bodies such as the ICRP and NCRP. Many citizen/environmental organizations
continued to recommend that the NRC should require decontaminating to a level indistinguishable from background.
They opposed setting any acceptable risk level or radiation dose for decommissioning because they believe that any
incremental increase over background dose is unacceptable. Most industry and other commenters recommended that
the decommissioning standard be based on technically supportable risk/dose criteria. Some commenters urged that
the proposed level be decided only after analyzing the costs and benefits of alternative proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters objected to inclusion of a quantitative goal in the rulemaking because it could be interpreted by
some as the standard that should be achieved in most cases. Other commenters agreed on inclusion of both a quantitative
goal and a quantitative limit. Some want these to be lower than the levels specified_TEDEs of 3 mrem and 15 mrem per year.
Many citizen/environmental organization commenters stated that, instead of specifying a numerical goal and a limit,
the regulatory objective should be to reduce contamination to a level that is not distinguishable from background.
Other commenters stated that doses in the range of 3 mrem to 15 mrem per year are indistinguishable from background.
Most of these commenters recommended that the dose limit should be increased to a level between 25 and 100 mrem per year,
or possibly higher. Reasons for recommending a higher dose limit included (1) the criteria should conform to recommendations
of national and international scientific consensus organizations; (2) a cost-benefit analysis would support a
higher limit; (3) the criteria should be based on scientific analyses and not based on intuitive feelings; (4) there
are no practical means to demonstrate compliance with TEDEs of 3 and 15 mrem per year; and (5) efforts to comply with
such levels would waste large resources in remediating small risks with no real gain in benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended that the goal be dropped from the rule. Some of these commenters suggested the goal
instead be incorporated into the guidance that would accompany the rule. A principal concern was that the goal would
become a de facto limit. In particular, the EPA, in presenting their comments on the goal, indicated concern over the
perception that the specification of any value, such as 3 mrem/yr, would be construed as the actual requirement for
the decommissioning. The EPA has verbally continued to express concerns regarding the NRC staff proposal of presenting
acceptable staff positions for ALARA documentation in the Regulatory Guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters requested that, because of possible failure of institutional controls, the NRC should not place
a dose restriction of 100 mrem per year on sites subject to restricted release. Commenters were divided on the requirement
that licensees base their estimates of greatest TEDE dose on the first 1000 years. Some stated that this time is unrealistically
long while others stated that it is unrealistically short. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters compared the proposed limits of 15 mrem/y and 3 mrem/y to risk limits/goals attributed to the EPA
and suggested that these comparisons are complicated by differences in scenarios for exposure used by the EPA and
the NRC, and by a basic difference between a limit and a goal. A limit must always be reached. A goal is not always reached.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters requested that the NRC include alternative radiological criteria for licensees who possess radioactive
materials of a kind and form not requiring extensive decontamination at the time of decommissioning. They suggested
that demonstration of compliance should be possible through direct radiation measurements and not require the use
of modeling and consultants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following responses are provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Appropriateness of 15 mrem/y TEDE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has considered the comments in light of information presented in the Generic Environmental Impact
Statement (GEIS) and the Regulatory Analysis (RA). These studies show that residual radioactivity can be reduced
to levels which will result in an annual TEDE of 15 mrem without unreasonable effort or expense for most radionuclides
and most facilities. A summary of this analysis can be found in Sections 5 through 7 of the GEIS and Sections 4 and 6 of
the RA. In those few cases where reducing the residual radioactivity to the levels required to comply with the 15 mrem/y
TEDE limit for unrestricted use are either not technically achievable, would be prohibitively expensive, or would
result in net public or environmental harm, &sect;20.1405 of the proposed rule provides the licensee with the option
of requesting release of the site with restrictions placed on its use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters have argued that a 15 mrem/y limit for unrestricted release is not consistent with the recommendations
of the ICRP and NCRP and that the limit should be raised to as high as 100 mrem/y. The Commission believes that an additional
margin of safety below 100 mrem/yr is necessary because the 100 mrem/y limit is intended to apply to doses to the public
resulting from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
radiation sources (NCRP Report No. 116, Section 15; ICRP Publication 60, Section 5.5). Therefore, allocation of
the entire 100 mrem/y dose to residual radioactivity from the decommissioning of a single facility would be inappropriate.
Using a safety margin to limit the dose from a single source to avoid a summation of exposures approaching the dose limit
is consistent with the recommendations of both the ICRP and the NCRP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Removal of Goal from the NRC staff Draft Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As formulated in the NRC staff draft rule, the goal was designed to serve two principal objectives. First, and foremost,
it would clearly articulate the NRC's objective for decommissioned sites. Second, it would establish a dose level
well below the limit at which licensees who have little or no site contamination (e.g., licensees that use only sealed
sources or short lived radioisotopes) would be relieved of much of the burden of analysis associated with the ALARA
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reexamined the goal concept based on the comments received, and has concluded that having both a limit
and a goal in the rule can lead to confusion concerning the Commission's intent. Therefore, in order to clarify the
Commission's intent and to make it clear that 15 mrem/y TEDE is the only limit, the Commission has dropped the term ``goal''
from the rule. Instead the Commission has substituted the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, in order to clearly articulate the Commission's continued commitment to the objective for decommissioned
sites, the following statement of objective has been included in &sect;20.1402 of the proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of decommissioning is to reduce the residual radioactivity in structures, materials, soils, groundwater,
and other media at the site so that the concentration of each radionuclide that could contribute to residual radioactivity
is indistinguishable from the background radiation concentration for that radionuclide. The Commission realizes
that, as a practical matter, it would be extremely difficult to demonstrate that such an objective has been met. Therefore,
the Commission has established a site release limit and is requiring that licensees demonstrate that the residual
radioactivity at a site is as far below this limit as reasonably achievable.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, in order to provide administrative relief to licensees who have little or no site contamination, the Commission
has revised &sect;20.1404 of the rule to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A site will be considered acceptable for unrestricted use if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) the residual radioactivity that is distinguishable from background radiation results in a TEDE to the average
member of the critical group that does not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) per year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the residual radioactivity has been reduced to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Depending on the site-specific ALARA analysis, any dose level less than or equal to 15 mrem/y may be considered ALARA.
However, in many situations, licensees who have little or no site contamination should be able to readily achieve
a dose level well below the limit. The NRC will provide guidance as to how such licensees can demonstrate compliance
with Section 20.1404(b) without having to perform sophisticated analyses to demonstrate that residual radioactivity
levels at their sites are ALARA. This should substantially reduce the administrative burden on licensees who have
little or no site contamination (e.g., licensees that use only sealed sources or short lived radioisotopes). There
are approximately 17,000 NRC and Agreement State licensees, many of which are small businesses, that are expected
to benefit from this guidance without any compromise to public health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Time Frame. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated in the rationale for the proposed rule, the Commission believes the 1000 year time frame proposed
by the NRC staff is reasonable for estimating annual doses from residual radioactivity from decommissioned sites.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When predicting thousands of years into the future, uncertainties become very large because of major potential changes
in the hydrogeologic regime at the site over these long periods of time. When the potential consequences of exposure
to the radioactive source are great; e.g., as in the case of a high level waste repository, distant future calculations
may provide some insight concerning the relative magnitude of consequences. However, the consequences of exposure
to residual radioactivity at levels near background are small and considering the large uncertainties, long term
modeling of near background doses may be virtually meaningless. Thus, the Commission does not believe it would serve
any useful purpose to attempt to estimate radiation doses from residual radioactivity thousands of years into the
future.

3. Individual vs Collective Doses

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that collective dose should be used by the NRC to evaluate costs and benefits of alternative
radiological criteria. The Department of Energy suggested that an ALARA analysis, based on collective dose and competing
risks for certain sites with low population exposure, might indicate that the criteria proposed by the NRC may not
be justifiable. Most commenters favored using dose to individuals to ensure protection of the public health. Many
citizen/environmental groups disagreed with the proposal to limit individual dose to the ``average member of the
Critical Group.'' They recommended that the goal and limit as described in the staff's draft rule be applied to the
maximally exposed individual in the exposure group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission agrees with the commenters that collective dose should be used by the NRC to evaluate the costs and benefits
of alternative radiological criteria. In fact, this has been incorporated in the assessment of the total risk for
the respective alternatives in the GEIS and the RA. Although these documents were unavailable for review by the commenters,
the technical analyses in the GEIS and the RA support the criteria in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission considers the use of TEDE to the average member of the Critical Group to be a more useful concept for the
purposes of decommissioning for the reasons discussed in the Rationale for the Proposed Rule. The discussion of ``Critical
Group'' in the Rationale has been revised to make it clear that the critical group must be reasonably homogeneous.
This clarifies that the licensee cannot average doses over a group whose members may be expected to get widely differing
doses for the purpose of ``averaging down'' expected doses to highly exposed individuals.

4. Consistency and Compatibility

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was the case at the earlier workshops, commenters urged that the NRC and the EPA work together to develop consistent
standards. Conservation of Federal resources and avoidance of imposing different standards on regulated parties
were considered to be important. However, the NRC was advised not to lower its risk limit simply to accommodate the
EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters recommended that the degree of consistency that the NRC will require between NRC standards and Agreement
State standards be clearly stated. One commenter suggested that the Federal standard be set to ensure adequate protection
of the public and that if a State or local community requires a licensee to decommission to a lower standard that does
not provide a significant benefit, then the State or local community should fund this extra effort. Agreement State
commenters requested that the statement of considerations for the proposed rulemaking discuss the extent to which
they must implement specific provisions of the rule to maintain continued regulatory compatibility with NRC regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the comments concerning the relationship between NRC and EPA standards, NRC and EPA are developing
decommissioning criteria in parallel rulemaking efforts. The NRC and EPA are coordinating their efforts in this
area to ensure that effective and consistent site decommissioning standards are established, while minimizing
duplication of effort. Accordingly, the EPA was an important participant in the NRC rulemaking workshops and is a
cooperating agency in the preparation of the GEIS for the rulemaking. The NRC has also consulted extensively with
EPA throughout the rulemaking process. The objective is that EPA will be able to make a finding that NRC decommissioning
criteria provide adequate protection for the public and the environment and will exclude NRC licensees from the EPA
cleanup standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the question of NRC/Agreement State compatibility, the Commission is developing a new policy on Agreement
State compatibility which will be issued for public comment in the near future. Because the compatibility determination
for this proposed rule will be considered in light of the new compatibility policy, the Commission believes it would
be premature to propose a compatibility determination at this time. However, to facilitate ultimate resolution
of the compatibility determination for this rule, if adopted as a final rule, the Commission is requesting comments
on whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances, an Agreement State should be authorized to establish more
stringent requirements than those set forth in this proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finality of decommissioning was a major issue among commenters. Various commenters stated (1) that revisiting sites
should be based on new site-specific information and not on new evaluation methods and (2) that the criteria for revisiting
sites are too subjective and require clarification or refinement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission agrees that the wording in the NRC staff draft was ambiguous. Therefore, &sect;20.1401(c) has been
revised to make it clear that the Commission would require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it
determined that residual radioactivity remaining at the site could result in significant public risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Community Involvement

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff draft specified that the Commission will inform the public of each receipt of a decommissioning plan
from a licensee and of each proposal for restricted release of a site. In addition, it specified that licensees who
propose to release sites under stipulated conditions of restricted release must convene a Site-Specific Advisory
Board (SSAB) for purpose of providing advice to the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several industry commenters questioned the need for these additional requirements on the grounds that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Present procedures for public participation in licensing procedures are adequate and provide an appropriate
way to deal with the concerns of those affected by decommissioning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There is no demonstrated need; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The provisions of SSABs would put managerial, regulatory, and financial matters of licensees in the hands of people
who have no responsibility for the consequences of their recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most other commenters supported the proposed new community involvement proposals and some commenters additionally
urged the NRC to require establishment of an SSAB for all decommissioning cases, including sites suitable for unrestricted
release. Others recommended that an SSAB should be used in cases involving Native American lands, sites surrounded
by high density residential uses, ocean or waterfront sites, or sensitive ecosystems unless the three (3) millirem
per year decommissioning goal would be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional comments on the use of SSABs included: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The rulemaking should delimit SSAB roles and responsibilities;

(2) Guidelines are needed with respect to SSAB staffing and activities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) SSABs should not report to licensees or be funded by licensees because this could compromise their effective use;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Membership should be restricted to ``citizen, environmental, environmental justice, and other public interest
groups'' who reside in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local community; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The membership should include a representative of the site to which wastes are expected to be sent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 With respect to the need for additional community involvement, the Commission believes that the noticing requirements
and the requirements to establish and use SSABs should be implemented as proposed in the NRC staff draft. The proposed
termination of licenses and release of sites under conditions of restricted release involve issues (e.g., land restrictions)
which could have unanticipated adverse effects on the local community. The Commission wants to be sure it has considered
the views of affected members of the local community on these issues before making a decision on the licensee's request.
These proposed provisions will provide an effective means to inform the affected licensees, local and state governments,
and the NRC of these views. However, the Commission believes that an extension of the SSAB requirement to apply to cases
involving unrestricted release is unnecessary and would impose an undue burden with little or no public benefit on
a large number of licensees, many of which are small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to delimiting the role and responsibilities of SSABs and providing guidance on SSAB staffing and activities,
the Commission specifically requests further comment on these issues. After gaining experience with the formation
and use of SSABs, it might be appropriate to reconsider the need for this guidance at a later date. Regarding the funding
and control of SSABs, the Commission believes that licensees should provide the necessary funding as proposed. The
proposed rule contains safeguards to ensure that the SSABs are not subject to licensee control. The licensee would
be required to provide reasonable opportunity for all local affected parties to be represented on the SSAB. Meetings
of the SSAB must be open to the public. The licensee must provide adequate public notice of the location, time, date,
and agenda for the meetings at least two weeks in advance of each meeting. All records generated or reviewed by the SSAB
become part of the licensing docket and will be available for public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to restriction of the SSAB membership to the local community, the intent of the provisions in &sect;20.1407(c)
is such a restriction. Regarding the proposal to expand memberships of the SSAB to include a representative of the
designated offsite disposal site, the Commission believes that the offsite disposal site is not relevant for consideration
by the SSAB, because siting of the waste disposal facility involves a separate public process that, in part, recognizes
that wastes will be transported to the waste facility.

7. Stability and Flexibility

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most of those who commented on stability or flexibility provided in the draft rule said that a generic standard should
be written to provide enough flexibility to account for actual risks associated with conditions peculiar to specific
sites in protecting the public and the environment, and to select appropriate site-specific remediation methods.
Some commenters said that the imposition of strict generic standards without flexibility might not provide an optimum
protection strategy across the range of categories of licensees. Other commenters noted that the adequacy of flexibility
provided under the draft proposed rule cannot be decided without the necessary guidance documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission also recognizes the need for flexibility in applying these criteria because of constraints posed
by site-specific conditions (e.g., geology, hydrology, meteorology, and radiation background levels) and to provide
opportunity for meaningful participation by local communities in individual decommissioning actions. Therefore,
the proposed rule provides for site-specific implementation of the generic criteria. The Commission is publishing
the NRC staff's working draft regulatory guidance along with the proposed rule which describes methods for site-specific
implementation of the criteria. This working draft guidance includes conduct of site characterization and surveys,
specific radionuclide concentration and surface activities that would be considered by the NRC staff to meet the
15 mrem/y TEDE limit, and modeling acceptable to the staff to develop more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site-specific values of concentration or surface activity based upon the factors unique to the activity being decommissioned.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comments on the ALARA concept were much the same as provided at the earlier workshops. Most public/environmental
organization commenters stated that they do not trust licensees to make ALARA determinations. Industry and other
commenters stated that they support the NRC's permitting them to make ALARA determinations and urged the NRC to continue
to permit licensees to use site specific factors in making these determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes that ALARA is a fundamental concept of radiation protection and is an important part of its
decommissioning criteria. NRC guidance being issued in support of the rulemaking provides for the use of site-specific
factors in deciding what levels should be achieved below the stipulated radiological limit. This guidance will be
described in NUREG&hyph;1500 ``Working Draft Regulatory Guide on Release Criteria for Decommissioning; Staff
Draft for Comment.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many submitting written comments urged the NRC to complete its guidance on acceptable methodologies criteria as
soon as possible and to publish this guidance for comment before the rulemaking is issued for final public comment.
Many commenters questioned the technical ability to demonstrate compliance with the proposed dose goals or limits
in the staff's draft, or questioned the technical justification for such requirements, or said that there are no standards
for demonstrations of compliance. Several others said that demonstrating compliance to the proposed dose goals
or limits is impractical and will unnecessarily increase costs and volumes of low-level wastes generated during
decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters said that there must be practical or objective guidance for demonstrating compliance. Some said
that this guidance should be issued for review before the rule is promulgated. Some commenters raised questions on
who makes the final decisions on demonstrating of compliance and by what means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested that simplified guidance (not requiring the use of modeling or consultants) should be
provided for designated licensees who have only low levels of contamination or ``uncomplicated situations'' in
their operations. Some commenters said that the public might more easily understand demonstration of compliance
if alternative limits to the ones proposed were used. Several commenters said that compliance should be demonstrated
by actual measurements and not just by modeling. Some commenters also suggested specific methodologies for demonstrating
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The capabilities for demonstrating compliance are considered in the GEIS and the RA which provide the technical basis
for the radiological criteria in the rule. Guidance that is being issued for public comment in conjunction with the
publication of the proposed rule will cover acceptable methods for demonstrating compliance, the use of simplified
methods or practical derived measurements and measurements units, and verification by practical measurement techniques
not necessarily requiring modeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the question concerning who makes the final decisions on whether the licensee has demonstrated compliance
with the rule, the NRC or, as appropriate, the Agreement State will make this determination. Where necessary the NRC
or Agreement State will conduct independent confirmatory surveys to ensure that the appropriate criteria have been
met.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many public/environmental organization commenters stated that licensees should not be permitted to walk away from
a contaminated site and that contamination should be removed to the extent that radioactive materials and radiation
are indistinguishable from background. Many voiced opposition to any release of sites under restricted use conditions.
This opposition was based largely on concern about the long term effectiveness of institutional controls to ensure
compliance with the conditions for restricted release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters generally endorsed both the unrestricted and restricted release of sites. With respect to restricted
release of sites, commenters: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Stated that the NRC should better define the circumstances which could qualify a site for restricted release;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Recommended that the NRC give examples of acceptable institutional controls for providing reasonable assurance
that specified dose limits are not exceeded; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Requested that the NRC publish guidance on determination of necessary financial assurance for proper control
and maintenance of a site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters recommended that the NRC adopt a dose level below 100 mrem per year as the upper dose limit in the event
of failure of the applied institutional controls. Still other commenters stated that the 100 mrem per year restriction
could foreclose onsite disposal of wastes as presently permitted at uranium mill tailings sites and that this restriction
should be deleted. Several commenters requested that the NRC better address the issue of consolidation and long-term
care of wastes at sites not suitable for restricted release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that engineered disposal cells might be the best solution for sites with large quantities of slightly
contaminated soils, while another said that large volumes of slightly contaminated soil with a few ``hot spots''
should be regarded as homogeneously contaminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC believes that the rule should provide for both unrestricted release and for restricted release of sites. Additionally,
there may be sites that will have to continue under license. The NRC is issuing guidance, first in draft form for comment,
on how it expects to implement the provision for restricted release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 100 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
&blank;mrem/y restriction is designed to establish an upper bound on the risk in the unlikely event of failure of institutional
controls or restrictions at the site. This restriction is also designed to ensure that license termination under
restricted conditions does not result in a proliferation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 disposal sites. The Commission believes that 100 mrem/y is an adequately conservative upper bound. This dose corresponds
to the maximum annual dose during the first 1000 years following decommissioning. In many cases, the peak dose occurs
during the first year following decommissioning. For these cases, the predicted dose levels will be reduced by radioactive
decay so that if institutional controls or restrictions at the site were to fail some time in the future the actual public
dose would be substantially below 100 mrem/y in most cases. In cases where buildup of radioactive daughter products
or other conditions cause the peak dose to fall other than in the first year after decommissioning, the predicted dose
levels are significantly below 100 mrem/y for the large majority of the first 1000 years after decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of an appropriate value for the dose in the unlikely event of failure of institutional controls has been a
key point of the ongoing discussions between the EPA and the NRC. As noted in section entitled ``Rationale for the Proposed
Rule'' of this Statement of Considerations, the Commission is specifically soliciting comment on the appropriateness
of this value, and the impacts associated with the selection of other values such as 75 mrem/yr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disposal of tailings and soil cleanup at milling sites is regulated under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control
Act of 1978 (UMTRCA). The impact of the dose limit on unique practices at uranium mill tailings sites may require case-by-case
consideration in the interest of consistency with current regulation of tailings under UMTRCA.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A commenter stated that waste disposal issues must be discussed in the EIS. Some commenters stated that the criteria
do not seem to recognize and should more adequately consider the non-linear increase in waste volumes at low concentrations
of radioactive materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that the NRC should consider allowing for some decommissioning under restricted conditions
with on-site emplacement, storage, and monitoring of radioactive wastes. Several commenters stated that previously-buried
wastes should be cleaned up at the time of decommissioning consistent with the generic cleanup standard. Several
others disagreed, saying that it is ``unfair'' or unnecessary to include these previously-buried wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agreement State commenters were concerned over the adequacy of the space at regional disposal facilities for the
large amount of material to be generated from the decommissioned sites. The concern was enforced by the lack of a GEIS
to review and assertion that data used in the EIS for 10 CFR Part 61 is over 10 years old. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Waste disposal issues, including matters of the relationships between waste volumes and cleanup levels, are discussed
in the GEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission maintains its position that public and environmental risk is an overriding factor that requires the
consideration of the removal of previously-buried wastes as a part of decommissioning. Even though a previous burial
was carried out within the regulatory requirements at an operating site, the potential differences in conditions
between the site as operated and as decommissioned require such consideration. The requirements for previously-buried
wastes are consistent with the Commission's established regulatory practice for decommissioning under the Site
Decommissioning Management Plan (SDMP). The proposed rule requires an analysis of site-specific overall risks,
costs, and benefits in deciding, for individual sites, whether or not the exhumation and removal of previously-buried
wastes is required.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC staff draft contained a section on minimization of contamination. Most commenters supported the concept
of minimization of contamination, but several industry commenters preferred not to include the proposed provisions
in the rulemaking on radiological criteria for decommissioning. Industry commenters stated that these concepts
do not need to be put in regulations because waste minimization and hence, minimization of contamination, is commonplace
in the nuclear industry and is driven by such economic incentives as reduction of disposal costs. Some commenters
recommended that the NRC publish guidelines for public comment on the actions that licensees are expected to take
in minimizing the production or release of contamination, and that the NRC should similarly publish for public comment
the criteria it will use to determine if licensee proposals are acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission agrees that existing ALARA programs and the cost of radioactive waste disposal provide sufficient
incentive to minimize radioactive waste. Therefore, requiring licensees to redesign existing facilities or amend
already approved radiation protection procedures is unnecessary and would not result in any substantial improvement
in public safety. Therefore, &sect;20.1408 (b) and (c) have been deleted from the proposed rule. However, the Commission
believes that there may be substantial potential to reduce contamination, facilitate eventual decommissioning,
and minimize generation of radioactive waste if special consideration is given to these issues when designing new
facilities. Therefore, &sect;20.1408(a) has been retained.

 Those submitting written comments mostly agreed with not establishing a separate standard for radon. Commenters
noted, however, that sites contaminated with radon-bearing-or-producing materials may have great difficulty
meeting the proposed dose goal and limit in the staff's draft.

 The Commission believes that a separate standard for radon is not needed and that NRC guidance being issued in support
of the rulemaking will provide licensees with sufficient information concerning measurement problems that are
associated with background radon. Additional comments are invited with respect to the problem of determining compliance
with the NRC's radiological criteria at sites contaminated with processed radon-bearing-or-producing materials.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There were a number of questions concerning definition of terms used in the draft rule. There were also several suggestions
for additions, deletions, or revisions to existing definitions in the draft rule, and there were some suggested new
definitions. Questions were raised concerning the use of terms such as, ``affected parties,'' ``significant,''
``average member,'' ``cumulative TEDE,'' ``decommissioning goal,'' ``unrestricted use,'' and ``net public or
environmental harm.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters objected to including fallout in the definition of background radiation. Others agreed with the
proposed definition or proposed various additions, revisions, or deletions to the definition, e.g., to change the
wording starting with the current words ``global fallout'' to ``global fallout from the testing of nuclear explosive
devices or from past nuclear accidents.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters said that the term ``residual radioactivity'' needs clarification with respect to materials
discharged from the site in accordance with other provisions of the regulations in 10 CFR Part 20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The practical implication of these terms and others in the proposed rule have been clarified in the guidance which
accompanies the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to ``background radiation,'' the new definition is the same as the existing definition except for the
addition of the words ``or from past nuclear accidents like Chernobyl which contribute to background radiation and
are not under the control of the licensee'' after ``explosive devices'' in order to explicitly recognize that radioactivity
from past nuclear accidents contributes to background radiation. Because the remaining wording has been adequate
in the past, the Commission sees no reason to further revise the definition at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission agrees that the proposed definition of ``residual radioactivity'' in &sect;20.1003 was not clear
with respect to materials discharged at the site in accordance with other provisions of 10 CFR Part 20. The definition
has been revised to clarify the Commission's intent.

Rationale for the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Conceptual Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The overall conceptual basis for decommissioning, as proposed in this rulemaking, consists of an objective to reduce
the residual radioactivity at the site so that it is indistinguishable from the background, a limit on the dose considered
acceptable for release of a site with a stipulation that dose be as far below this limit as reasonably achievable (i.e.,
ALARA), provisions in regulatory guidance for administrative relief from performing sophisticated ALARA analyses
for licensees who have little or no site contamination, provisions for restricted termination of a license when physical
remediation activities cannot achieve the limit, and enhanced provisions for public participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limit for release of a site is 15 mrem/y (0.15 mSv/y) TEDE for residual radioactivity distinguishable from background.
If doses from residual radioactivity are less than 15 mrem/y TEDE, the Commission will terminate the license and authorize
release of the site for unrestricted use following the licensee's demonstration that the residual radioactivity
at the site is ALARA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission expects the licensee to make every reasonable effort to reduce residual radioactivity to levels that
will allow unrestricted release of the site. However, the Commission will consider terminating a license in cases
where restrictions must be imposed on the use of the site to ensure that public doses are maintained below the 15 mrem/y
(0.15 mSv/y) TEDE limit, provided the licensee: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Can demonstrate that further reductions in residual radioactivity necessary to comply with the 15 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
&blank;mrem/y TEDE limit for unrestricted use are not technically achievable, would be prohibitively expensive,
or would result in net public or environmental harm; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Has made adequate provisions for institutional controls to reduce annual TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable
from background to the average member of the appropriate critical group to 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry out responsibilities
for any necessary control and maintenance of the site; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Has reduced the residual radioactivity at the site so that the TEDE from residual radioactivity would not exceed
100 mrem (1 mSv) per year even if the restrictions applied in the termination were no longer effective in limiting the
possible scenarios or pathways of exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission estimates that there may be several existing licensed sites (no more than a few tens) containing large
quantities of materials contaminated with low level radioactivity where health and environment may best be protected
by onsite stabilization and disposal. The contamination was generated over the last several decades using practices
that generally would not be found satisfactory today without adequate plans and financial assurance for decommissioning.
In some cases, a responsible public or private entity may no longer exist or be viable for discharging its responsibility
for ensuring protection of the public and the environment. In other cases, the contamination may have been generated
through research or development contracts with the Federal government or given special consideration in Federal
law. Due to the unique characteristics of these sites when compared with the much larger population of licensed nuclear
facilities, the Commission contemplates that the owners and operators of these facilities may seek exemptions from
the decommissioning criteria under the general provisions in 10 CFR 20.2301. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such sites, and the considerations associated with them, are not unlike disposal sites for uranium mill tailings,
and may need to be provided with equivalent types of controls to ensure sufficient protection. At a minimum, the Commission
would require that the public health and environmental protection requirements developed for these unique cases
be consistent with other appropriate regulatory requirements for disposal of radioactive waste, including those
in 10 CFR Part 61 ``Licensing Requirements for Land Disposal of Radioactive Waste'' or 10 CFR Part 40, Appendix A ``Criteria
Relating to the Operation of Uranium Mills and the Disposition of Tailings or Wastes Produced by the Extraction or
Concentration of Source Material from Ores Processed Primarily for their Source Material Content.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any Commission decision on such exemption requests and the disposition of these sites would be made on the basis of
a comprehensive analysis of the risks and benefits of all viable alternatives including remediation of the site to
meet the criteria in this rule. Proper disposition of these sites may require some type of durable institutional control,
such as placing the site under the custody of a State or Federal agency, to ensure long-term protection of the public
and environment. For example, for a former licensed site in West Virginia, the final disposition included action
by Congress that provided for transfer of the site to Federal custody and ongoing DOE oversight. Such an analysis would
have to consider all significant risks to humans and the environment resulting from the decommissioning process
(including transportation and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the process) and from residual radioactivity
remaining at the site following termination of the license. The Commission specifically solicits comments on this
approach to the handling of these unique cases, including proposals for alternative strategies which could be used
to assure adequate protection of public health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission envisions that the scope of the exemption request would be limited to the radiological criteria for
unrestricted or restricted release. Due to the unique nature of these sites and the comprehensive evaluation necessary
to support such an exemption request, the Commission would require that a meaningful and substantial process be used
by the licensee or the NRC itself for informing and involving the public in the decision. Consequently, the Commission
would not favorably entertain exemption requests unless they were developed through a process consistent with the
public involvement processes required in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For any process conducted by the NRC, the Commission would solicit participation from: the Environmental Protection
Agency; local and State governments; persons residing in the vicinity of the site; citizen, environmental, environmental
justice, and other public interest groups; Indian Nation or other indigenous people that have treaty or statutory
rights that could be affected; and other affected parties. For example, in reviewing proposed decommissioning actions
at two licensed sites in Ohio and New Jersey, the Commission has initiated development of Environmental Impact Statements
(EISs) for both sites and recently held public meetings on the scope of the EISs with the intent to fully explore the
alternatives and potential impacts associated with the disposal of the contaminated material. As a part of this process,
NRC is working closely with EPA, State, local representatives, and members of the public to develop acceptable alternatives.
The site-specific process applied at these sites by the NRC is attempting to include participation by all affected
parties to assure continued protection of public health and safety through a viable and effective decommissioning
approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Commission recognizes there may be existing sites where public health and the environment may best be
protected by onsite stabilization and disposal, the Commission does not believe that future activities should result
in additional sites that would not be able to meet the criteria in this rule. Therefore, the Commission is proposing
to add a new &sect;20.1408 to its regulations which would require that applicants for licenses, other than renewals,
describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the
facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive
waste.

The following definitions already present in the regulations would be revised: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of Background Radiation (10 CFR 20.1003) would be revised so that fallout from past nuclear accidents
like Chernobyl which contribute to background radiation and are not under the control of the licensee are included
in the definition. The Commission does not believe it is reasonable for licensees to be required to remediate material
over which they have no control and which is present at comparable levels in the environment both on and off of the site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of Decommission would be revised to also provide for termination of a license and release of property
under restricted conditions. This revision was requested by a large number of commenters at the workshops on decommissioning.
Those commenters felt that the NRC should recognize that it may not be feasible to decontaminate some sites to a level
appropriate for unrestricted use and that restrictions on the subsequent use of such sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be used to provide an additional measure of public protection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following new definitions would be added: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Critical Group would be defined as the group of individuals reasonably expected to receive the greatest exposure
to residual radioactivity given the circumstances under which the analysis would be carried out. For example, if
the site were to be released for unrestricted use the Critical Group would be the group of individuals reasonably expected
to be the most highly exposed considering all reasonable potential future uses of the site. This would include renovation
of structures, water use, and industrial, residential, and agricultural uses of the land and structures. If the site
were to be released with restrictions, the licensee would have to assess both the dose to the average member of the group
of individuals reasonably expected to be the most highly exposed assuming that the proposed restrictions were successfully
imposed and adhered to (the ``Critical Group'' appropriate to this set of circumstances) and the dose to the average
member of the group of individuals reasonably expected to be the most highly exposed if the proposed restrictions
were to fail (in essence the ``Critical Group'' for unrestricted termination of the license). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Critical Group, for purposes of screening dose calculations, is defined for each scenario described in NUREG/CR&hyph;5512,
Volume 1. In each scenario, the Critical Group is an individual or relatively homogeneous group of individuals expected
to receive the highest exposure within the assumptions of the particular scenario. The average member of the Critical
Group is that individual who is assumed to represent the most likely exposure situation based on prudently conservative
exposure assumptions and parameter values within the model calculations. For example, the Critical Group for the
building occupancy scenario is the group of workers occupying a building that has been decontaminated. The average
member of that group is assumed to spend 2000 hours per year working in the building and is exposed to residual contamination
via the external, inhalation, and inadvertent ingestion pathways. A more detailed discussion of acceptable methods
for selecting the critical group and estimating the dose to the average member of the group can be found in Section III.G.
of the draft regulatory guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is a departure from the requirement in &sect;20.1302 where, for licensed activities, the licensee is required
to assess the dose to ``the individual likely to receive the highest dose.'' However, in contrast to licensed facilities
where public doses normally result from activities that are carefully prescribed and controlled, the public doses
from residual radioactivity at decommissioned sites may result from a variety of activities for which the maximally
exposed individual is much more difficult to precisely define. Furthermore, in ongoing operations licensed by the
Commission, it is possible to update or keep track of who might be likely to receive the highest exposure. In decommissioning,
there will be no ongoing mechanism that would allow for adjustments of imposition of additional controls. Therefore,
the Commission believes it is more prudent to use the average member of the critical group for assessing TEDE from residual
radioactivity after the license is terminated because this provides a reasonably conservative estimate of public
risk without attempting to speculate on which specific individual may be expected to receive the highest dose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The practice of defining and using a Critical Group when assessing individual public dose from low levels of radioactivity
similar to those expected from a decommissioned site is proposed in Section 5.5.1 of the 1990 recommendations of the
International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP 60) and has been adopted in the current draft of the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) Draft Federal Radiation Protection Guidance for Exposure of the General Public. For the
purpose of this Subpart, the licensee would be required to estimate the dose to the average member of the critical group
from residual radioactivity remaining at the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indistinguishable from background would mean that the detectable concentration of the radionuclide is not statistically
different from the background concentration of that radionuclide in the vicinity of the site, or in the case of structures,
in similar materials using adequate measurement technology, survey methodology, and statistical techniques.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Readily removable would refer to residual radioactivity, as defined below, which is removable using non-destructive,
common, housekeeping techniques (e.g., washing with detergent and water) that do not generate large volumes of radioactive
waste requiring subsequent disposal. This would not include techniques that produce chemical wastes that are expected
to adversely affect public health or the environment. Readily removable would also not refer to residual contamination
dispersed in soil under conditions where removal of the residual radioactivity could only be accomplished by moving
large volumes of soil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Residual Radioactivity would include radioactivity in structures, materials, soils, groundwater, and other media
at the site resulting from licensed activities at the site. This would include radioactivity from all licensed and
unlicensed sources used by the licensee but would exclude background radiation. This term should not be confused
with the term ``residual radioactive material'' which appears in 10 CFR 40.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Site-Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) would be a committee constituted by the licensee to provide advice to the licensee
on decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would apply to the decommissioning of all facilities licensed by the Commission except for facilities
or portions thereof (e.g., waste disposal sites and uranium mill tailings) that are already specifically covered
in the regulations. It provides for both unrestricted and restricted release of sites. The proposed rule would not
apply to sites already covered by a Commission approved decommissioning plan if the plan was approved before the effective
date of the rule. This provision is designed to encourage licensees to continue with ongoing and planned decommissioning.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a site has been decommissioned and the license terminated in accordance with the criteria in this proposed rule,
the Commission would require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it determines that residual radioactivity
remaining at the site could result in significant public or environmental harm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes there may be existing sites containing large quantities of materials contaminated with
low level radioactivity where public health and the environment may best be protected by onsite stabilization and
disposal with proper restriction of the site to prevent human disruption of the site and exposure to the radioactive
contamination. There are precedents for these cases in the stabilization of uranium mill tailings under the Uranium
Mill Tailings Remediation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA) and the DOE Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program
(FUSRAP). In these cases, some type of durable institutional control, such as placing the site under the custody of
a State or Federal agency, may be necessary to ensure long-term protection of the public and the environment. However,
consideration of these actions would require extensive site-specific safety and environmental analyses. In addition,
input from affected parties in the vicinity of the site would be desirable to determine whether there are other local
impacts that must be considered in determining the best course of action and to ensure the long-term effectiveness
of the institutional controls. For these reasons, the Commission has determined that these actions fall outside
the scope of this rulemaking in the sense that there may be site-specific determinations using criteria other than
those proposed in this rulemaking. If, in the future, general criteria to evaluate these actions can be developed,
the Commission will consider additional rulemaking to establish the criteria for general application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also require that all new applicants for licenses, other than renewals, describe in the application
how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the facility and the environment,
facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive waste.

Radiological Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would establish a dose limit for release of a decommissioned site of 15 millirem per year (mrem/y)
TEDE for residual radioactivity distinguishable from background. The 15 mrem/y TEDE dose limit was selected to provide
both a substantial margin of safety below the NRC's dose limit for members of the public and an appropriate limit for
the acceptability of release of a facility which would no longer be subject to regulatory control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated lifetime risk associated with an annual TEDE of 15 mrem/y is approximately 4E&hyph;4. This estimate
was arrived at by using a risk coefficient of 4E&hyph;4 per rem and assuming an exposure lifetime of 70 years. The 4E&hyph;4
risk factor is roughly equivalent to the 3.92E&hyph;4 risk factor in Table 6.6 of the EPA NESHAPS Background Information
Document (EPA89). Use of this value is consistent with the calculational methods of the Environmental Protection
Agency which is also promulgating regulations in this area. The 70-year exposure lifetime provides a conservative
estimate of lifetime exposure. The Environmental Protection Agency is using a 30-year lifetime exposure in estimating
lifetime risk from residual radioactivity at decommissioned sites. This is based on the assumption that it is unlikely
that an individual will continue to live or work in the same area for more than 30 years. Using a 30-year exposure lifetime
the estimated lifetime risk associated with an annual TEDE of 15 mrem/y would be approximately 2E&hyph;4. A more detailed
discussion of estimating lifetime risk can be found in appendix B of the GEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In selecting this limit, the NRC staff took into account recommendations of the ICRP and NCRP and those criteria promulgated
by EPA and NRC which provide acceptance criteria for areas where unrestricted access in the vicinity of facilities
is permitted, such as generally applicable environmental standards established by EPA and the criteria used for
remediation of contaminated sites under the Superfund (CERCLA) program. The dose value of 15 mrem/y TEDE is generally
consistent with the risks implied by those criteria and with the remediations which have been achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters have argued that a 15 mrem/y limit for unrestricted release is not consistent with the recommendations
of the ICRP and NCRP and that the limit should be raised to as high as 100 mrem/y. The Commission believes that an additional
margin of safety below 100 mrem/yr is necessary because the 100 mrem/y limit is intended to apply to doses to the public
resulting from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 radiation sources (NCRP Report No. 116, Section 15; ICRP Publication 60, Section 5.5). Therefore, allocation of
the entire 100 mrem/y dose to residual radioactivity from the decommissioning of a single facility would be inappropriate.
Using a safety margin to limit the dose from a single source to avoid a summation of exposures approaching the dose limit
is consistent with the recommendations of both the ICRP and the NCRP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the cost/benefit impact analysis in the GEIS (Chapters 5 and 6 and Figures 7&hyph;1 through 7&hyph;11)
indicate that costs of achieving a 15 mrem/yr limit would not be unduly burdensome on licensees. In those few cases
where remediation to achieve 15 mrem/yr may present an unreasonable burden, release of the site with restrictions
placed on its use provides an alternative means for achieving this level of protection.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would also require that the licensee reduce any residual radioactivity to as close to indistinguishable
from background as reasonably achievable. ALARA considerations are to include all significant risks to humans and
the environment resulting from the decommissioning process, and licensees are to demonstrate why further reductions
below the limit are not reasonably achievable. Depending on the site-specific ALARA analysis, any dose level less
than or equal to 15 mrem/y may be considered ALARA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in many situations, licensees who have little or no site contamination should be able to readily achieve
a dose level well below the limit. The NRC will provide guidance as to how such licensees can demonstrate compliance
with &sect;20.1404(a)(ii) without having to perform sophisticated analyses to demonstrate that residual radioactivity
levels at their sites are ALARA. This should substantially reduce the administrative burden on licensees who have
little or no site contamination (e.g., licensees that use only sealed sources or short lived radioisotopes). There
are approximately 17,000 NRC and Agreement State licensees, many of which are small businesses, that are expected
to benefit from this guidance without any compromise to public health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that demonstrating that radionuclide levels at a site are indistinguishable from background
is a complex task involving sophisticated sampling, measuring, and statistical analysis techniques. The difficulty
of the task can vary substantially depending on a number of factors including the radionuclide in question, the background
level for that and other radionuclides at the site, and the temporal and spatial variations in background radiation
at the site. Therefore, in order to assist the licensee in making these determinations, the Commission will publish
specific guidance on acceptable methods which can be used by the licensee to demonstrate that the concentrations
of specific isotopes at the site are indistinguishable from background. The Commission will also publish guidance
on acceptable methods for estimating annual TEDE to the average member of the Critical Group. This guidance will include
a discussion of the type of scenarios and exposure pathways which should be considered, and computer models for estimating
the annual TEDE to the average member of the critical group. The computer models will be screening models that employ
generically derived conservative assumptions and factors. However, licensees will be able to substitute assumptions
and factors more appropriate to a particular site if they can demonstrate that these factors and assumptions reasonably
reflect the existing and projected conditions at the site. Licensees may also use other models or methods for estimating
TEDE, provided they can demonstrate to the Commission that these models or methods provide reasonable estimates
for the site to be decommissioned. This guidance is described in NUREG&hyph;1500 ``Working Draft Regulatory Guide
on Release Criteria for Decommissioning; Staff Draft for Comment.'' The Commission requests comment on the appropriateness
of the approach and the methodology described in NUREG&hyph;1500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As can be seen from Figures 7&hyph;1 through 7&hyph;11 of the GEIS, it appears reasonable to expect that a number of
licensees will be able to remediate their sites to dose levels below the 15 mrem/yr limit at reasonable cost. However,
these same analyses indicate that in most cases there are large incremental costs associated with reductions below
3 mrem/yr, and that the incremental costs are due primarily to the cost of demonstrating compliance rather than the
cost of additional remediation. Therefore, when attempting to achieve doses below 3 mrem/y, costs can increase substantially
with little or no additional reduction in risk to public health or the environment. Section 7&hyph;5 of the GEIS also
indicates that levels of residual radioactivity which produces a dose of 3 mrem/yr are generally difficult to distinguish
from natural background because they are comparable to local variations in background radiation and substantially
smaller than national variations in background radiation. As a result, the staff draft regulatory guide (NUREG&hyph;1500)
proposes that, in order to minimize the burden of documentation and analysis in such cases, the Commission would consider
documentation that the TEDE to the average member of the critical group from all radionuclides distinguishable from
background does not exceed 3 mrem/y as sufficient for demonstrating compliance with the ALARA requirement. The Commission
invites comment on this provision in the guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would broaden the definition of decommissioning to include release for restricted use in addition
to release for unrestricted use. The underlying approach for restricted release is that the risk for a member of the
public should be limited to acceptable levels, irrespective of whether that individual is exposed during the conduct
of some occupation or in residential or recreational activities. Thus, the conditions for restricted release are
premised on restricting the use of the site so that average individual doses do not exceed the 15 mrem/yr dose limit.
While the circumstances of the exposure (i.e., the duration or pathway) may thus be varied, the underlying risk limit
remains respected for any critical group of individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensees unable to meet the requirements for unrestricted use would be allowed to request permission to release
sites for restricted use with subsequent termination of the license if they can demonstrate that the following conditions
have been met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Further reductions in residual radioactivity are not technically achievable, the cost of achieving further
reductions would be prohibitively expensive, or further reductions would directly produce environmental or public
harm that is clearly excessive compared to the health or environmental benefits achieved through these reductions
now or in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has proposed this provision as the fundamental basis for determining when a restricted termination
of a license will be appropriate. Technical achievability, prohibitive expenses, and excessive environmental
or public harm are the three areas in which the Commission believes that alternative considerations should be examined
as part of the overall process of determining the most appropriate action for a site. Clearly, if remediation is simply
not possible given the technological capabilities in existence at the time of decommissioning, some other types
of alternatives must be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In terms of excessive costs, the Commission recognizes that there may be situations where removal and disposal of
large quantities of material is simply not reasonable from a cost standpoint. An example of this type of situation
that has already been addressed is the disposal of mill tailings, where a separate set of standards has been developed,
including provisions for institutional control. The third condition, excessive environmental or public harm,
has been included in recognition that although remediations may be technically possible and within the overall resources
of society, the net damage, through removal and disposal of materials, alteration of ecosystems, or displacement
of populations, could be too great to not be undertaken. Considerations of this nature are best determined through
public participation, which is provided through provisions for a Site-Specific Advisory Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third condition also provides for the possibility that the net environmental impact of completely remediating
a site and then constructing an entirely new site to perform a similar activity may be inappropriate. An example of
this could be the continued use of a site for electrical power generation, where a number of existing facilities, such
as the turbine and electrical distribution system could be used with a different energy source. This approach would
need to be examined on a case-by-case basis, and a determination made regarding the appropriateness of remediating
the site for unrestricted use vs some type of restricted use in order to conserve environmental resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There are adequate provisions for institutional and/or other passive controls to provide reasonable assurance
that the TEDE from residual radioactivity to the average member of the critical group will not exceed 15 mrem (0.15
mSv) per year. Institutional controls would have to be enforceable by a responsible Government entity or in a court
of law in response to suits by affected parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision specifies the fundamental dose limit for considerations of restricted termination. The core requirement
is that an individual should not be exposed to a greater level of risk than that established for unrestricted use releases.
Thus, the application of restrictions must be able to reduce the average dose to the appropriate critical group to
the same 15 mrem/year value used as the limit for unrestricted use. However, in the restricted use situation, the critical
group will be different from the critical group that would need to be considered in the unrestricted situation. For
example, a restriction might be imposed that would prevent residential applications or agricultural uses of the
facility. These restrictions would mean that critical group would have different exposure characteristics (e.g.,
8 hours per day while working in a building) and thus, a larger quantity of radioactivity could be allowed to remain
onsite for the same dose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) There is sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry out responsibilities
for any necessary control and maintenance of the site. Acceptable financial assurance mechanisms will include:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision has been included to assure that mechanisms have been established as necessary to ensure the continued
effectiveness of the controls that may be used to meet the dose limit. The ongoing effectiveness of the restrictions
will not necessarily be the responsibility of the former licensee but could be vested in other organizations, local
governments, etc., which would continue cognizance of the action. This responsibility could include periodic monitoring,
overviews of site access restrictions, or other activities that might be necessary to support the proposed controls.
Under this provision, the amount of financial assurance that would be needed will be determined on a site-specific
basis, taking into account the proposed restrictions, and the recommendations of the Site-Specific Advisory Board.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Residual radioactivity at the site has been reduced so that if the site were released for unrestricted use, the
TEDE from residual radioactivity to the average member of the critical group is as low as reasonably achievable and
would not reasonably be expected to exceed 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year. This limit coincides with the NRC dose limit for
public exposure in 10 CFR Part 20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final condition is premised on the assumption that circumstances could develop under which the restrictions,
such as land use or deed restrictions, might no longer be effective in limiting the exposure scenarios. If, for example,
a restriction against residential or agricultural use were no longer effective in preventing those uses of the land,
then the assumptions about the exposure of the critical group would no longer be valid. While this is not assumed to
occur for planning purposes, the Commission believes it is appropriate to have a ``safety net'' to prevent exposures
in excess of the public dose limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of this provision also has the effect of requiring that some remediation be conducted at the site,
rather than simply allowing a licensee to develop a series of restrictions. The Commission believes it appropriate
that basic measures be taken to reduce the risk and dose that could result from a site and that the public dose limits
form the minimum acceptable level of protection that should be provided in the unlikely event that restrictions are
not effective in reducing the magnitude and scenarios of exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission specifically solicits public comment on the adequacy of the 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year value as the ``safety
net'' to prevent exposures in excess of the public dose limits in the event that all site restrictions fail. The recommendations
of the ICRP and NCRP, as well as Draft Federal Guidance being developed by the EPA, suggest constraining the dose to
members of the public from any single source to less than 100 mrem/y as a way to ensure that the total public dose from
all sources does not exceed 100 mrem/y. The Commission has followed this principle in establishing the dose limit
for decommissioning. However, in the case of the ``safety net'', the Commission does not believe that fractionation
would be necessary for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The 100 mrem/y cap, although being equivalent to the dose limit for members of the public, represents a small fraction
of the 500 mrem/y dose that the Draft Federal Guidance suggests is acceptable for members of the public in unusual circumstances.
The Commission believes that failure of all site restrictions at decommissioned sites is a highly unlikely event.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The 100 mrem/y value applies to the peak dose during the first 1000 years. For most radioisotopes, this peak dose
occurs in the first year and diminishes over time due to radioactive decay. This decay provides an additional margin
of safety which is equivalent to an

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 fractionation of the limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The 100 mrem/y value is less than the value selected for controlling intruder scenarios for other types of facilities
where some type on institutional control (e.g. government ownership) is contemplated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Commission is soliciting suggestions for alternatives to the proposed safety net, including the use
of some fraction of 100 mrem/y (e.g., 75 mrem/y) as the safety net. The Commission is particularly interested in the
relative merits of selecting a fraction of the routine public dose limit in light of the required conservatism in the
calculation of the dose, and the rationale for selecting some particular fraction. The Commission is also soliciting
comments on the relative benefits and impacts of the Commission's proposed safety net and proposed options, including
comments on the number of facilities that could be impacted by selection of alternative values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes there may be unusual circumstances in which the licensee may wish to seek an exemption from
one or more of the provisions of this subpart. For example, the licensee may feel it is unnecessary to clean up a site
to the requirements for unrestricted release because the site is contained within a larger area where use will be restricted
for the foreseeable future. The Commission believes these rare circumstances can adequately be handled under existing
provisions in &sect;20.2301 which provides opportunity for the licensee to request an exemption from any of the provisions
of 10 CFR Part 20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also recognizes there may be special environmental or cultural issues associated with a particular
decommissioning action which would require more stringent implementation of the requirements in this subpart.
For example, there may be social or cultural issues that have to be considered because the site is on or contiguous to
historical sites or Native American lands which contain religious or sacred areas. However, the Commission believes
these issues can best be handled on a site-by-site basis as part of the licensing process and, in most cases, would be
taken into consideration when establishing ALARA residual radioactivity levels for a site. The Commission does
not believe that further reductions in dose would be necessary to meet social or cultural issues if the limit for unrestricted
use is achieved and ALARA has been applied. Where necessary, the provisions for public comment and for a Site-Specific
Advisory Board will provide a mechanism for local citizens and other affected parties to be directly involved in addressing
these issues.

Public Participation in the Decommissioning Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes it is important for the public to not only be fully informed of the decommissioning actions
at a particular site but also to be able to effectively participate in site decommissioning decisions. The proposed
rule will provide for public participation in the decommissioning process through three mechanisms in addition
to the relevant NRC requirements regarding hearing opportunities for a particular site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon the receipt of a decommissioning plan from the licensee, or a proposal by the licensee for restricted release
of a site pursuant to &sect;20.1405, or whenever the Commission deems such notice to be in the public interest, the
Commission shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notify and solicit comments from local and State governments in the vicinity of the site and Indian Nation or other
indigenous people that have treaty or statutory rights that could be affected by the decommissioning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as well as in other media, such as local newspapers, which are readily accessible to individuals in the vicinity of
the site; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Solicit public comment on the proposed decommissioning action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions are designed to provide affected individuals and organizations with both information about the
proposed decommissioning and an opportunity to provide comments on the licensee's proposal. The Commission believes
it is particularly important to provide notice in a forum that is accessible to local individuals. This forum may vary
from site to site but would usually include providing notice to local media for publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For decommissioning where the licensee does not propose to meet the conditions for unrestricted release, the proposed
rule would require that the licensee convene a Site-Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) as described in &sect;20.1407
for the purpose of obtaining advice from affected parties regarding the proposed decommissioning. The purpose of
the SSAB would be to provide recommendations to the licensee on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether there are ways to reduce residual radioactivity to a level necessary to comply with the provisions of &sect;20.1404
which are technically achievable, would not be prohibitively expensive, and would not result in net public or environmental
harm; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether provisions for institutional controls proposed by the licensee will: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Provide reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to
the average member of the critical group will not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE per year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Be enforceable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Impose undue burdens on the local community or other affected parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether the licensee has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume
and carry out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The areas in which the SSAB would be expected to provide recommendations parallel the areas that a licensee must address
as part of its proposal for a restricted termination of license. The intent of the provision is to provide a mechanism
for early public involvement in the development of the decommissioning plan for the site. To the extent that local
public involvement may be vital to the successful implementation of land use restrictions, involvement of representatives
of local government, affected citizens, Native Americans, and other interested parties in the Site-Specific Advisory
Board is important to the long-term effectiveness of the decommissioning action. In order for the participation
to be most effective, it should come during the development of the plan, rather than as comment after the licensee has
spent significant resources to develop its proposal. Hence, the recommendations of the SSAB are to be included in
the decommissioning plan along with the licensee's disposition of those recommendations. It is important to note
that the opportunity for comment provisions would still be applicable even when a SSAB had been used in the development
of the decommissioning plan.

Site-Specific Advisory Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SSAB has been patterned after the recommendations contained in the Interim Report of the Federal Facilities Environmental
Restoration Dialog Committee (FFERDC) entitled ``Recommendations For Improving the Federal Facilities Environmental
Restoration Decision-Making and Priority Setting Processes, February 1993,'' which is a consensus document developed
by over 40 members of a committee chartered by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The diverse members
of the FFERDC represented Federal, Tribal, State, environmental, labor, and citizen interests. It is designed to
respond to the desire expressed by many workshop commenters that local affected parties have early and substantive
input into the decommissioning process on a site-specific basis. The SSAB would supplement and not supplant existing
NRC procedures that provide for public input into the regulatory process. The Commission believes that increasing
the opportunity for early public involvement in the decommissioning process is an effective way to provide an information
exchange and to ensure credible and defensible licensing decisions, especially when the long-term effectiveness
of the land use restrictions may depend on community knowledge and involvement in their development and application.
The Commission would emphasize that the operation of the SSAB is not intended to usurp the traditional land use authority
of the local or State government. In fact, many of the institutional controls that may be recommended by an SSAB to ensure
the restricted use of a site will depend on the exercise of this traditional authority by the local or State government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensee notification to the Commission of intent to decommission in accordance with &sect;&sect;30.36(b), 40.42(b),
50.82(a), 70.38(b) or 72.54 would have to specify whether the licensee intends to reduce residual radioactivity
at the site to levels which would allow the site to be released for unrestricted use. If not, the licensee would be required
to submit a plan for establishing and supporting an SSAB with the notification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee would be responsible for establishing the SSAB and developing appropriate ground rules and operating
procedures for the SSAB with the advice of the SSAB. The SSAB would consist of about 10 members plus an ex officio representative
from the Commission. This number of members is expected to allow for adequate representation of affected parties
without allowing the group to become so large that it cannot perform its function effectively. The licensee would
be required to provide adequate administrative support for SSAB activities and provide the SSAB access to studies
and analyses pertinent to the proposed decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Membership of the SSAB, to the extent that representatives are willing to participate, would have to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reflect the fullest practical range of interests in the affected community and region and be composed primarily
of individuals who could be directly affected by residual radioactivity at the decommissioned site, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Include representatives from the licensee; local and State governments; workers; persons residing in the vicinity
of the site; citizen, environmental, environmental justice, and public interest groups; and Indian Nation or other
indigenous people that have treaty of statutory rights that could be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meetings of the SSAB would be open to the public. The licensee would be required to provide adequate public notice of
the location, time, date, and agenda for the meetings at least 2 weeks in advance of each meeting. All records generated
or reviewed by the SSAB would become part of the decommissioning docket, and would be available for public inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In most cases it is expected that the work of the SSAB would be completed after it had formally submitted its advice to
the licensee. However, there may be some cases (e.g., where the licensee's plan is substantially altered following
NRC review) in which the SSAB may have a continuing role in providing advice to the licensee. In any case, it is anticipated
that the SSAB would be dissolved after the license has been terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking comment on whether there are situations where it might be inappropriate or infeasible to
establish an SSAB under conditions set forth in &sect;20.1406(b). For example, are there situations where establishment
of an SSAB would be inconsistent with other governmental regulations and statutes, or are there circumstances in
which local government officials may not be allowed to participate in privately funded advisory groups. If so, what
alternatives would be available to satisfy the objectives of public participation and input? Should criteria be
incorporated in the regulation for granting exemptions to the requirements of &sect;20.1406(b) for good cause.
If so, what criteria might be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also seeking comment on what the content of descriptive information on membership, size, operating
procedures, administrative support, and distribution of agendas should include, and whether this information
should be included in the rule or in a regulatory guide or other document.

General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Readily Removable Residual Radioactivity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is clear that some structures can easily be decontaminated to levels well below those necessary to reduce individual
doses from residual radioactivity at a decommissioned site to a few mrem TEDE/y above background. Past decommissioning
practice has been based on the premise that ``the licensee should make a reasonable effort to eliminate residual radioactivity.''
See Regulatory Guide 1.86, ``Termination of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Reactors,'' June 1974, pg. 3. Some previously
released structures have been decontaminated to levels below those specified in Regulatory Guide 1.86 for some nuclides.
Therefore, the Commission proposes to require that all readily removable residual radioactivity be removed from
a site before it is decommissioned. This is considered a necessary and reasonable step toward ensuring that doses
to the public from residual radioactivity are ALARA. For the purpose of this proposed regulation, the Commission
has defined readily removable to mean removable using non-destructive, common, housekeeping techniques (e.g.,
washing with moderate amounts of detergent and water) that do not generate large volumes of radioactive waste requiring
subsequent disposal. This would not include techniques that produce chemical wastes that are expected to adversely
affect public health or the environment. It would also not include removal and transport of soil except when small
discreet areas of contamination can be removed by digging up a few shovelfuls of soil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of these proposed provisions is to define the basic types of remediation that should be undertaken as a matter
of good practice regardless of whether the site meets the NRC residual radioactivity criteria. However, it is not
the Commission's intent to require more substantive remediation without the benefit of careful planning and ALARA
considerations. The Commission specifically solicits comments on how to best define the activities that should
be included under this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Radioactive Materials Previously Disposed of at the Site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under NRC regulations, licensees may dispose of radioactive wastes on their own property. Before 1981, NRC regulations
(10 CFR 20.304) allowed disposal without prior approval of limited quantities of specified nuclides under prescribed
conditions. On July 28, 1981, &sect;20.304 was revoked because the Commission did not have sufficient assurance
that these disposals would be adequately protective. However, onsite disposal can still be undertaken by individual
licensees under 10 CFR 20.2002 (previously &sect;20.302), provided the disposal is specifically approved by the
NRC or an Agreement State. If this buried radioactive material is considered to be part of the licensee's total site
inventory for decommissioning purposes, some licensees will likely be required to remove all or part of this material
before decommissioning the site. This position may be controversial because it can be argued that materials already
disposed of in accordance with existing NRC requirements should no longer be considered part of the licensees inventory
of radioactive material. Nevertheless, removal of the previous burials may be necessary to achieve the proposed
radiological criteria and ensure sufficient protection of the public and environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proposed rulemaking, the Commission takes the position that public and environmental risk is the overriding
factor. Therefore all residual radioactivity at the site, including that previously disposed of in accordance with
NRC requirements in &sect;&sect;20.304, 20.302, and 20.2002 must be included in determining whether the licensee
meets the radiological criteria in the proposed rule. However, the Commission is aware that the balancing of risks,
costs, and benefits may be substantially different for exhuming buried material than they would be for decontamination
of surface soils and structures. Therefore, it is expected that before any decision is made to exhume radioactive
material previously disposed of at a site, the licensee will perform a site-specific analysis of the overall risks,
costs, and benefits of this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This position is consistent with positions already taken by the NRC on this issue. In the Supplementary Information
to the Final Rule ``General Requirements for Decommissioning Nuclear Facilities'' (published on June 27, 1988,
53 FR 24021), the Commission states it will ``take a hard look at the extent to which the site has been used to dispose
of low level radioactive wastes by land burial, and will decide what remedial measures including removal of such wastes
offsite, are appropriate before the site can be released for unrestricted use.'' In the Site Decommissioning Management
Plan (SDMP) the NRC staff notes that ``disposals performed under 10 CFR 20.304 have at several sites required exhumation
during the decommissioning and takes the position that acceptability of these burials will be assessed in future
decommissioning procedures.'' See SECY&hyph;91&hyph;096, Enclosure 1 ``Site Decommissioning Management Program,
Revision 1 (January 1991)'' p. 16. See also, the draft Regulatory Guide on ``Standard Format and Content for Decommissioning
Plans for Nuclear Reactors,'' which states that the licensee's plan should indicate the extent of waste burial onsite
and the remedial measures appropriate before the site can be released for unrestricted use.

Use of Actual Measurements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Commission recognizes that it will be necessary in many cases for the licensee to use modeling to estimate
the TEDE to the average member of the critical group from residual radioactivity at the site, the proposed rule would
require that estimates of the site specific source term (i.e., residual radioactivity remaining at the site) be substantiated
using actual measurements to the maximum extent practical. The reason for this substantiation of estimates is that
using actual measurements reduces the uncertainty associated with the estimates and provides a greater measure
of assurance that radiological requirements are being met. It is expected that substantiation would be carried out
in accordance with the survey requirements in 10 CFR 20.1501. Information and guidance related to surveys and use
of measurement techniques have been published in draft form for public comment as NUREG/CR&hyph;5849. An NRC staff
working draft regulatory guide is being published with this proposed rulemaking which specifically addresses these
topics. The Commission plans to publish further guidance in draft form before the effective date of the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Time Frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is some difference of opinion on how far into the future calculations should be carried out for the purpose of
establishing acceptable residual radioactivity levels for decommissioned sites. Current NRC staff practice is
to calculate projected doses out to 1,000 years in the future in evaluating radiological impacts associated with
residual radioactivity. This is consistent with current DOE practice. See, Order DOE 5400.5 ``Radiation Protection
of the Public and Environment.'' EPA's high level waste regulations require that cumulative releases to the environment
be calculated out to 10,000 years. See, 40 CFR part 191 (Note: 40 CFR part 191 was remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit in July 1987, and is being reconsidered by EPA.) However, there are some who think such calculations
should be carried out to provide estimates of potential contamination of groundwater for tens or even hundreds of
thousands of years into the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When predicting thousands of years into the future, uncertainties become very large because of major potential changes
in the hydrogeologic regime at the site over these long periods of time. When the potential consequences of exposure
to the radioactive source are great; e.g., as in the case of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high-level waste repository, distant future calculations may provide some insight concerning the relative magnitude
of consequences. However, the consequences of exposure to residual radioactivity at levels near background are
small, and considering the large uncertainties, long term modeling of near background doses may be virtually meaningless.
In light of this, the Commission does not believe it would serve any useful purpose to attempt to estimate radiation
doses from residual radioactivity thousands of years into the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although theoretical maximum doses for a few isotopic decay chains do not occur for hundreds or thousands of years,
for most radionuclides of interest in decommissioning the peak dose occurs in less than 1,000 years. Therefore, the
Commission proposes to require that TEDE estimates be based on the greatest annual dose expected within the first
1000 years after decommissioning. This annual dose must be interpreted as the TEDE delivered in that year, including
the committed dose equivalent from radionuclides taken into the body during that year. The Commission notes that
a time frame of 1,000 years is also being considered by the EPA, as indicated in the draft regulatory language, discussed
during the NACEPT Meeting in May 1994.

Risk Considerations in ALARA Calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters at the workshops on decommissioning stated that all risks should be taken into account when
setting requirements for decommissioning a site. A principal concern was that the Commission, in an attempt to reduce
residual radioactivity levels at a site, would establish cleanup requirements which could result in an overall risk
increase, or in risk transference, rather than risk reduction. For example, in an attempt to clean up a site for decommissioning,
the licensee may increase risk to persons along transportation routes and at the site where the material is finally
disposed by transporting large volumes of debris from the site. In addition, disposal of large quantities of low-level
radioactive debris at licensed low-level waste disposal sites could deplete the capacity of existing sites and ultimately
result in a proliferation of licensed disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission, recognizing the validity of these concerns, proposes to require that the licensee, when determining
ALARA, consider all significant radiation doses and risks resulting from residual radioactivity and the decommissioning
process itself, including transportation and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the process. This analysis
would be part of the decommissioning plan and would be available for comment by interested parties under the public
participation provisions described earlier in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure compatibility with EPA groundwater standards, the proposed rule requires licensees to remediate
their sites so there is a reasonable expectation that residual radioactivity from the site will not cause the level
of radioactivity in any groundwater that is a current or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential source of drinking water to exceed the limits specified in 40 CFR Part 141 as they exist on the effective date
of this regulation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Groundwater Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 20.1404(d) of the proposed rule would require that licensees demonstrate a reasonable expectation that
residual radioactivity from a decommissioned site will not cause the level of radioactivity in any groundwater that
is a current or potential source of drinking water to exceed the limits specified in 40 CFR Part 141. This provision
is in addition to the overall radiological criterion for unrestricted release in 10 CFR 20.1404(a)(i) that the residual
radioactivity that is distinguishable from background radiation results in a TEDE to the average member of the critical
group that does not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is soliciting comments on the proposed groundwater protection requirement. In particular, the Commission
solicits comments on the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Is a separate standard needed for groundwater when the overall radiological criterion of 15 mrem applies to all
pathways, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Given that natural background is included in 40 CFR 141, and given that for pathways of exposure covered by this rule,
background is excluded, what alternatives exist for reconciling this difference in approach? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Is it appropriate to apply a drinking water standard (``at the tap'') to groundwater in all cases.

Minimization of Contamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters at the workshops on decommissioning expressed the opinion that the Commission should be placing
more emphasis on ensuring that licensed facilities are designed and operated in a way that would minimize the amount
of radioactive contamination generated at the site during its operating lifetime. The Commission is sympathetic
with this view. Therefore, the Commission proposes to require that applicants for licenses, except for renewals,
describe in their applications how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of
the facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive
waste. This provision is a prospective requirement for new licensees to examine contamination and waste minimization
early in the process of facility design and license approval.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission considers that under existing regulations it is reasonable to expect new licensees, other than renewals,
to provide for ease of decommissioning and minimization of waste when designing and operating facilities. However,
given past experience, the Commission believes that this new requirement is necessary to focus applicant's attention
on the type of facility design and good housekeeping practices needed to minimize the types of problems the Commission
has had to face with problem sites like those addressed in the Commission's Site Decommissioning Management Plan
(NUREG&hyph;1444, October 1993).

Timeliness
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission does not want to create a situation where time requirements for completing decommissioning would
make it difficult or impossible for licensees to safely and properly remediate large, complex, or otherwise difficult
to decommission facilities. Therefore, the Commission is requesting comments on whether the criteria contained
in this proposed rule can be met within the time frames that were specified in the final rule on ``Timeliness in Decommissioning
of Materials Facilities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, the Commission is soliciting comments on whether licensees that anticipate having to establish an
SSAB should be exempted from the generic timeliness requirements. If so, what alternative provisions could be made
to assure timely decommissioning of the site? For example, could licensees be required to provide site-specific
decommissioning schedules during the earliest stages of decommissioning, or during preparation for decommissioning,
e.g., in the decommissioning plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Relationship Between the Generic Environmental Impact Statement and Site-Specific Decommissioning Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Generic Environmental Impact Statement prepared by the Commission on this rulemaking evaluates the environmental
impacts associated with the remediation of several types of NRC-licensed facilities to residual radioactivity
levels ranging from 100 mrem/yr TEDE down to 0 mrem TEDE (background). The Commission believes that the generic analysis
will encompass the impacts that will occur in any Commission decision to decommission an individual site. Therefore,
the Commission plans to rely on the GEIS to satisfy its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act in
regard to individual decommissioning decisions that meet the 15 mrem/yr criterion for unrestricted use. However,
the Commission will still initiate a preliminary environmental review in regard to any particular site to determine
if the generic analysis encompasses the range of environmental impacts at that particular site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also provide for the termination of the license and the release of a site under restricted conditions
if the licensee can demonstrate that the use of land use restrictions or other types of institutional controls will
provide reasonable assurance that the 15 mrem/yr limit can be met. The types of controls and their contribution to
providing reasonable assurance that the 15 mrem/yr limit can be met for a particular site will differ for each site
in this category. Therefore, the environmental impacts cannot be analyzed on a generic basis and the Commission will
conduct an independent environmental review for each site-specific decommissioning decision where land use restrictions
or institutional controls are relied on by the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GEIS indicates that the decommissioning of certain classes of licensees (e.g., licensees using only sealed sources)
will not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, for these categories
of licensees, the Commission is proposing to amend 10 CFR Part 51.22 of the Commission's regulations to specify that
the decommissioning of these types of licenses are actions eligible for categorical exclusion from the Commission's
environmental review process.

Use of Land Use Restrictions or Other Types of Institutional Controls To Allow Termination of the License and Release
of the Site Under Restricted Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Commission anticipates that most licenses can be terminated for unrestricted use, the Commission also
anticipates that there may be situations where the site radiological criteria can only be met through the use of land
use or other types of institutional controls which will restrict the site to specific uses. For example, there may
be some sites where unrestricted use for agricultural purposes or residential uses would cause the proposed criteria
to be exceeded. However, restricting the same site to industrial or commercial uses would enable the site to meet the
15 mrem/y TEDE dose limit because the exposure pathways would be limited. The licensee, with the advice of the Site
Specific Advisory Board, would propose certain types of land use or institutional controls in the decommissioning
plan submitted for Commission approval, to provide reasonable assurance that the site would be limited to the types
of uses that would enable the proposed criteria to be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of these controls include traditional zoning controls to restrict the use of the site to specific uses, the
imposition of deed restrictions such as restrictive covenants or equitable servitudes to restrict the land to certain
uses, negative easements where the licensee-landowner agrees to restrict the use of the land to specified uses, licensee
agreements to restrict the use of certain portions of the land (for example, restricting access to a particular building),
or even some type of government ownership of the property. Whatever type of controls are proposed by the licensee,
the licensee must demonstrate that the controls proposed have a reasonable expectation of enforcement. A decommissioning
plan that is dependent on land use or institutional controls whose enforcement are speculative would not be approved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission recognizes that demonstrating that radioisotope levels at a site are indistinguishable from background
may be a complex task involving sophisticated sampling, measuring, and statistical analysis techniques. The difficulty
of the task can vary substantially depending on a number of factors that include the radionuclide in question, the
background level for that and other radionuclides at the site, and the temporal and spatial variations in background
radiation at the site. Therefore, in order to assist the licensee in making these determinations, the Commission
will publish specific guidance on acceptable methods which can be used by the licensee to demonstrate that the concentrations
of specific radionuclides at the site are indistinguishable from background. The Commission will also publish specific
guidance on acceptable methods for estimating annual TEDE to the average member of the Critical Group. This guidance
will include a discussion of the type of scenarios and exposure pathways which should be considered, and computer
models for estimating the annual TEDE to the average member of the critical group. The computer models will include
screening models which employ generically derived conservative assumptions and factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, licensees will be able to substitute assumptions and factors more appropriate to a particular site if they
can demonstrate that these factors and assumptions reasonably reflect the conditions at the site. Licensees may
also use other models or methods for estimating TEDE provided they can demonstrate to the Commission that these models
or methods provide reasonable estimates for the site to be decommissioned. When using modeling to estimate doses
from radioactivity remaining at the site, the licensee will be able to use site specific parameters wherever practical.
In the absence of site-specific information, the licensee must use parameters which provide a sufficient margin
of safety that the Commission can make a finding that there is reasonable assurance the TEDE criteria in this part will
be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An NRC staff working draft regulatory guide will be published simultaneously with the proposed rule as NUREG&hyph;1500,
``Working Draft Regulatory Guide on Release Criteria for Decommissioning: NRC Staff's Draft for Comment.'' This
publication allows licensees and interested members of the public to provide early comment during the developmental
process. The draft regulatory guide has no official regulatory standing. The NRC staff anticipates that the draft
regulatory guide will be published with the final rule and will incorporate public comments and the results of continued
technical development activities. The draft regulatory guide published with the final rule will be for interim use
and comment to fulfill the rule requirements and test implementation options. The final regulatory guide will be
published approximately 1 to 2 years after publication of the final rule and would take into consideration comments
on the draft guide as well as information regarding experience in implementing the draft guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft regulatory guide provides guidance on methods that are acceptable to the NRC staff for determining the predicted
dose level (PDL) from any residual contamination remaining at a facility, that should be compared to the numerical
dose criteria specified in the regulation. It describes the basic features of the calculational models and the associated
default assumptions and parameter values that the NRC staff would find acceptable in calculating PDLs. Appendices
to the guide provide numerical values that are used to estimate the dose from various residual radioactivity levels
remaining at a facility. Also included are the considerations inherent in the ALARA process for decommissioning.
Because the proposed 10 CFR Part 20, Subpart E, introduces several new concepts, a regulatory position concepts section
containing definitions and discussions is included to assist licensees in understanding some of the philosophy
underlying the rule. The regulatory position concepts section is followed by the regulatory position procedures
section that describes actions the licensee can take to implement the requirements of the decommissioning rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has also issued the following supporting documents to provide guidance on implementation of the residual
contamination criteria in the proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``Guidance Manual for Conducting Radiological Surveys in Support of License Termination'' (NUREG/CR&hyph;5849),
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Technical Basis Document, ``Residual Radioactive Contamination from Decommissioning: Technical Basis for
Translating Contamination Levels to Annual TEDE'' (NUREG/CR&hyph;5512). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Guidance Manual for Conducting Radiological Surveys is intended to provide licensees with specific guidance
on planning, conducting, and documenting site surveys which could be used to demonstrate that the site has been decontaminated
to a level consistent with the Commission's criteria. The Technical Basis Document would provide an acceptable method
for translating residual radioactivity levels (measurable quantities) to doses to individuals. Generic dose rate
conversion factors are being developed for screening. In addition, the technical basis is expected to include a computer
model which can be used for conducting a screening scenario/pathway analyses with site-specific parameters so that
site-specific dose rate conversion factors can be calculated. The NRC anticipates that in most cases these dose rate
conversion factors could be used to determine compliance with criteria resulting from the rulemaking action.

Agreement State Compatibility

The Commission currently is developing a new policy on Agreement State compatibility which will be issued for public
comment in the near future. The compatibility determination for the radiological criteria for decommissioning
will be considered in regard to the implementation of the new compatibility policy. Therefore, the Commission believes
that it would be premature to make a proposed compatibility determination on the radiological criteria for decommissioning
at this time. However, for the purpose of facilitating the ultimate resolution of the compatibility determination
for the radiological criteria for decommissioning, the Commission welcomes any comments on this issue. In particular,
the Commission invites comments on to what extent and under what circumstances should an Agreement State be authorized
to establish more stringent requirements than those set forth in NRC radiological criteria for decommissioning.

Regulatory Flexibility Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this rule, if
adopted, will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. Although the proposed
rule would cover all 22,000 licensees regulated by the NRC and Agreement States, small entities covered by this rule
are primarily licensees that possess and use only materials with short half-lives or materials only in sealed sources.
Decommissioning efforts for these licensees are simple and require only that sealed sources are properly disposed
of or that short-lived materials are allowed to decay. Complete details of the cost analysis are contained in Section
4.5 of the Regulatory Analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there is no indication that this proposed rule would significantly impact a substantial number of small
entities, the NRC is seeking comments from small entities that may be impacted by the rule. Any small entity subject
to this regulation which determines that, because of its size, it is likely to bear a disproportionate adverse economic
impact should notify the Commission of this in a comment that indicates the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The licensee's size and how the proposed regulation would result in a significant economic burden upon the licensee
as compared to the economic burden on a larger licensee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) How the proposed regulations could be modified to take into account the licensee's differing needs or capabilities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The benefits that would accrue, or the detriments that would be avoided, if the proposed regulations were modified
as suggested by the licensee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) How the proposed regulation, as modified, would more closely equalize the impact of NRC regulations or create
more equal access to the benefits of Federal programs as opposed to providing special advantages to any individual
or group; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) How the proposed regulation, as modified, would still adequately protect public health and safety.

Backfit Analysis

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule and therefore, that
a backfit analysis is not required for this proposed rule because these amendments do not involve any provisions which
would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

 Scope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The criteria in this subpart apply to the decommissioning of facilities licensed under Parts 30, 40, 50, 60, 61,
70, and 72 of this chapter, as well as other facilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954, as amended, and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended. For high-level and low-level waste
disposal facilities (10 CFR Parts 60 and 61), the criteria apply only to ancillary surface facilities that support
radioactive waste disposal activities. For uranium mills, the criteria apply to decommissioning of the facility
but not to the disposal of uranium mill tailings or to soil cleanup. (See Appendix A of 10 CFR Part 40).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The criteria in this subpart do not apply to sites already covered by a decommissioning plan approved by the Commission
before [insert effective date of rule] and in accordance with the criteria identified in the Site Decommissioning
Management Plan Action Plan of April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13389).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) After a site has been decommissioned and the license terminated in accordance with the criteria in this proposed
rule, the Commission will require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it determined that residual
radioactivity remaining at the site could result in significant public risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) This subpart also requires that, after the effective date of rule, applicants for licenses, other than renewals,
describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the
facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive
waste.

 Concepts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The objective of decommissioning is to reduce the residual radioactivity in structures, materials, soils, groundwater,
and other media at the site so that the concentration of each radionuclide that could contribute to residual radioactivity
is indistinguishable from the background radiation concentration for that radionuclide. The Commission realizes
that, as a practical matter, it would be extremely difficult to demonstrate that such an objective has been met. Therefore,
the Commission has established a site release limit and is requiring that licensees demonstrate that the residual
radioactivity at a site is as far below this limit as reasonably achievable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The limit for release of a site is 15 mrem/y (0.15 mSv/y) Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE) to an average member
of the Critical Group for residual radioactivity distinguishable from background. If doses from residual radioactivity
are less than 15 mrem/y TEDE, the Commission will terminate the license and authorize release of the site for unrestricted
use following the licensee's demonstration that the residual radioactivity at the site has been reduced to As Low
As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) ALARA considerations must include all significant risks to humans and the environment resulting from the decommissioning
process. Licensees shall demonstrate why further reductions below the limit are not reasonably achievable. Depending
on the site-specific ALARA analysis, any dose level less than or equal to 15 mrem/y may be considered ALARA. However,
in many situations, licensees may have little or no site contamination and should be able to readily achieve the overall
objective for decommissioning (e.g., licensees that use only sealed sources or short-lived radioisotopes).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Commission expects the licensee to make every reasonable effort to reduce residual radioactivity to levels
that will allow unrestricted release of the site. However, the Commission will consider terminating a license in
cases where restrictions must be imposed on the use of the site to ensure that public doses are maintained below the
15 mrem/y (0.15 mSv/y) TEDE limit, provided the licensee:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Can demonstrate by analysis of the benefits and risks of further reduction that residual radioactivity at the
site is ALARA and that further reductions in residual radioactivity necessary to comply with the 15 mrem/y TEDE limit
for unrestricted use are not technically achievable, would be prohibitively expensive, or would result in net public
or environmental harm;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Has made adequate provisions for institutional controls to reduce annual TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable
from background to the average member of the appropriate critical group to 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry out responsibilities
for any necessary control and maintenance of the site; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Has reduced the residual radioactivity at the site so that the TEDE from residual radioactivity would not exceed
100 mrem (1 mSv) per year even if the restrictions applied in the termination were no longer effective in limiting the
possible scenarios or pathways of exposure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) When calculating TEDE, the licensee shall base estimates on the greatest annual TEDE dose expected within the
first 1000 years after decommissioning. Estimates must be substantiated using actual measurements to the maximum
extent practical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When determining ALARA, the licensee shall consider all significant risks to humans and the environment resulting
from the decommissioning process (including transportation and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the
process) and from residual radioactivity remaining at the site following termination of the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) During decommissioning, the licensee shall take reasonable steps to remove all readily removable residual radioactivity
from the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The licensee shall demonstrate a reasonable expectation that residual radioactivity from the site will not cause
the level of radioactivity in any groundwater that is a current or potential source of drinking water to exceed the
limits specified in 40 CFR Part 141 as they exist on [insert effective date of this regulation].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Licensee notification to the Commission of intent to decommission in accordance with &sect;&sect;30.36(b),
40.42(b), 50.82(a), 70.38(b) or 72.54 of this chapter shall specify whether the licensee intends to decommission
in accordance with &sect;20.1405. Licensees proposing to decommission in accordance with &sect;20.1405 shall
submit a plan for establishing and supporting a Site Specific Advisory Board (SSAB).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Licensees proposing to decommission in accordance with &sect;20.1405, shall submit a decommissioning plan
to the Commission. This plan shall include the recommendations of the SSAB and the licensee's proposed analysis and

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A site will be considered acceptable for license termination under restricted conditions if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The licensee can demonstrate that further reductions in residual radioactivity necessary to comply with the
provisions of &sect;20.1404 are not technically achievable, would be prohibitively expensive, or would result
in net public or environmental harm; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The licensee has made provisions for institutional controls that provide reasonable assurance that the TEDE
from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to the average member of the critical group will not
exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE per year. Institutional controls must be enforceable by a responsible government entity
or in a court of law in response to suits by affected parties; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The licensee has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry
out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site. Acceptable financial assurance mechanisms
are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Funds placed into an account segregated from the licensee's assets and outside the licensee's administrative
control as described in &sect;30.35(f)(1) of this chapter;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Surety method, insurance, or other guarantee method as described in &sect;30.35(f)(2) of this chapter; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A statement of intent in the case of Federal, State, or local government licensees, as described in &sect;30.35(f)(4)
of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Residual radioactivity at the site has been reduced so that if the institutional controls were no longer in effect,
there is reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to the
average member of the critical group would not exceed 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year, and is as low as reasonably achievable.
Calculations used to show compliance with this provision may not assume any benefits from earthen cover or other earthen
barriers unless specifically authorized by the Commission.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in 9 CFR part 92, &sect;&sect;92.430, 92.431, 92.522, and 92.523 (referred to below as the regulations),
set forth the conditions under which importers may qualify animals to enter the United States through the Harry S Truman
Animal Import Center (HSTAIC) in Fleming Key, FL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the demand for quarantine space at HSTAIC has traditionally exceeded the space available, the regulations
provide that a lottery will be held each year during the first 7 days of December, to determine the priority of applications
for the following calendar year. To be included in the December lottery, applications must reach the Import-Export
Animals Staff of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) no earlier than October 1, and no later than
October 15 of the year of the lottery. Additionally, applicants must send a deposit in the form of a certified check
or money order in the amount of $32,000, payable to the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, for each application. APHIS will not consider an application unless we receive this deposit
from the applicant on or before November 29, 1994. In the event that the Import-Export Animals Staff receives no more
than one application between October 1, 1994, and October 15, 1994, the lottery will not be held, and APHIS will grant
exclusive right to use HSTAIC during calendar year 1995 in the order applications are received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants should be aware that certain improvements are being made to the HSTAIC facility in order to meet standards
set by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The availability of HSTAIC for use for 1995 lottery applicants
will be dependent upon satisfactory completion of these projects.

Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u),
the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the following Order: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, by an Act of Congress approved June 18, 1934, an Act ``To provide for the establishment *&blank;*&blank;*
of foreign-trade zones in ports of entry of the United States, to expedite and encourage foreign commerce, and for
other purposes,'' as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u) (the Act), the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) is authorized
to grant to qualified corporations the privilege of establishing foreign-trade zones in or adjacent to U.S. Customs
ports of entry; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the Board's regulations (15 CFR Part 400) provide for the establishment of special-purpose subzones when
existing zone facilities cannot serve the specific use involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, an application from the St. Louis County Port Authority, grantee of Foreign-Trade Zone 102, for authorization
for special-purpose subzone status at the manufacturing and distribution facilities of Florsheim Shoe Company
in Jefferson City, Cape Girardeau, Kirksville and West Plains, Missouri, was filed by the Board on August 13, 1993,
and notice inviting public comment was given in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (FTZ Docket 44&hyph;93, 58 FR 44652, 8/24/93); and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the Board has found that the requirements of the FTZ Act and Board's regulations are satisfied, and that approval
of the application is in the public interest; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now, therefore, the Board hereby authorizes the establishment of a subzone (Subzone 102C) at the plant sites of the
Florsheim Shoe Company in Jefferson City, Cape Girardeau, Kirksville and West Plains, Missouri, at the locations
described in the application, subject to the FTZ Act and the Board's regulations, including &sect;400.28.

buyers (including governments and private persons) regarding: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) fumigating, packing and other quality control and/or phytosanitary procedures to be followed in the export of
the Products. Such procedures may include activities related to insect and disease detection, certification, inspection,

of the foreign government; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the quantities, time periods, prices and terms and conditions, in connection with actual or potential bona fide
export opportunities, upon which NFE's Members will export the Products.

basis of actual expenses incurred.

storage, and treatment meet the requirements established by a relevant foreign government so that the Members' goods
will qualify for importation into the country subject to such requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members allocate the capacity of facilities, time of domestic and foreign

and each Member may supply to such employees or agents of NFE, information as to such Member's actual total export shipments
of fresh sweet cherries in any previous growing season or seasons, provided that such information is not disclosed

that the information or documents are required to determine that the Export Trade, Export Trade Activities, or Methods
of Operation of a person protected by this Certificate of Review continue to comply with the standards of section 303(a)
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Participation by a Member in any Export Trade Activity or Method of Operation under the Certificate shall be entirely
voluntary as to that Member, subject to the honoring of all phytosanitary and/or funding requirements by foreign

of fresh apples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Scope of Project:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed financial assistance award is a grant to the University to fund a Health and Environmental Research Program.
Activities will include models of advanced information communication research for regional health and environmental
research. The University is currently performing activities related to those proposed. The Biomedical Information
Communications Center has undertaken preliminary work in the development of an electronic health research information
network. The public benefit derived from this research will be greatly enhanced with the financial support from the
Department of Energy. It has been determined that a grant instrument is appropriate since the Department of Energy
anticipates limited direct involvement with the program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed basic research will contribute to the DOE mission by assisting in the development of improved solar water
heating technologies for use in buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Successful completion of this research would advance the goal of wide commercialization of solar water heating systems.
Deploying these technologies will reduce energy use in buildings which, in the U.S., accounts for about 40% of annual
national energy consumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary
to satisfactorily complete the current research. DOE funding for the Grant is estimated at $25,000 and the anticipated
period of performance is twelve (12) months.

A. Purpose and Program Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Department Energy Mentor-Protege Pilot Initiative is designed to encourage Department of Energy management
and operating contractors to assist energy related small disadvantaged businesses in enhancing their business
and technical capabilities to ensure full participation in the mission of the Department. The use of this integrated
working arrangement between companies will promote economic and technological growth, foster the establishment
of long term business relationships and increase the number of small disadvantaged businesses that receive Department
of Energy, other Federal and commercial contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. General Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
(a) Department of Energy management and operating contractors who are approved as mentor firms may enter into agreements
with eligible small disadvantaged businesses as protege firms to provide appropriate developmental assistance
to enhance the business and technical capabilities of small disadvantaged businesses to perform as contractors,
subcontractors and suppliers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The mentor-protege initiatives described in these regulations constitutes a pilot program that will have a duration
of two years with a one year option commencing from the date of the published final rule. During this period, management
and operating contractors, which have received approval by the Department of Energy to participate in the program
may enter into agreements with protege firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
C. Incentives for Mentor Participation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

F. Selection of Protege Firms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
(a) Protege selection will be implemented through a tier development plan as provided in subsection (b) below. This
tier development plan is intended as a guide from which an ``individualized'' plan can be developed for each protege.
The tier development structure recognizes the protege firms current business capacity and sets the parameters of
assistance for monitoring purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Mentor firms are encouraged to select proteges from each of the following areas:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Small disadvantaged businesses that presently have contracts or subcontracts with the Department;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Small disadvantaged businesses that are presently 8(a) or 8(a) graduates under the Small Business Administration
Program that have been actively engaged in business for at least five years; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Emerging small disadvantaged business firms that possess energy related or technical capability and have been
actively engaged in business for at least two years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Once a protege firm has been selected for participation in the program, a Mentor-Protege Plan signed by the respective
firms should be submitted to the Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization for approval. At the minimum,
the Plan should contain a description of the developmental assistance that is mutually agreed upon and in the best
developmental interest of the protege firm. Such assistance may not include payment of any monies.

Take notice that Iowa-Illinois Gas and Electric Company (Iowa-Illinois), 206 East Second Street, P.O. Box 4350,
Davenport, Iowa 52808, on August 10, 1994, tendered for filing pursuant to &sect;35.12 of the Regulations under the
Federal Power Act the initial rate schedules in the form of Facilities Schedule No. 3, relating to Walcott Substation,
dated July 12, 1994, and Facilities Schedule No. 4, relating to Blue Grass REC, dated July 12, 1994, to Service Schedule
C to the Interconnection Agreement dated June 13, 1983, between Iowa-Illinois and Central Iowa Power Cooperative
(CIPCO). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Iowa-Illinois states that the Facilities Schedules are a part of a major economic development effort by government
and business leaders in the state of Iowa to locate a new $360 million steel mill to be owned and operated by IPSCO, Inc.
(IPSCO) within the state. As a part of the effort, the state of Iowa enacted new legislation to provide economic incentives
to IPSCO to locate the mill in Muscatine County, Iowa. The construction of the mill in Iowa is expected to provide approximately
350 additional jobs by 1997 and an increase in state and local tax revenues of approximately $143 million.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CIPCO will provide electric energy to the steel mill. However, to deliver the electric energy to the steel mill, utilization
of Iowa-Illinois' transmission facilities and the construction of new transmission facilities by CIPCO will be
required. The Facilities Schedules provide for the utilization, construction and modification of these facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CIPCO plans to serve IPSCO's steel mill through two transmission sources utilizing Iowa-Illinois' transmission
facilities. One source will require CIPCO to convert an existing 69 kV line between Iowa-Illinois' Substation 56
and CIPCO's Fair Station to 161 kV, disconnect the line at Fair Station and connect it to the IPSCO Substation. The other
source will require CIPCO to construct a new 345 kV transmission line extending from the new Walcott Substation and
terminating at the IPSCO Substation adjacent to the steel mill. Under Facilities Schedule No. 3, CIPCO's new line
will interconnect at the Walcott Substation with Iowa-Illinois's 345 kV transmission line which extends from Hills
Substation to Substation 56. CIPCO will own Walcott Substation and Iowa-Illinois will operate and maintain the substation
at CIPCO's expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The portion of the transmission service which uses the interconnection at Substation 56 will be provided pursuant
to the Agreement for Interconnection of Transmission Facilities dated March 4, 1963 entered into by Iowa-Illinois,
Iowa Electric Light and Power Company (predecessor in interest to IES Utilities Inc.) and Eastern Iowa Light and Power
Cooperative (predecessor in interest to CIPCO). The remaining transmission service will be provided as required
by Facilities Schedule No. 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Facilities Schedule No. 4, Iowa-Illinois will supply all energy required at CIPCO's Blue Grass REC Substation
to the Point of Connection between CIPCO and Iowa-Illinois. CIPCO will deliver an equivalent amount of energy including
losses on a scheduled basis to Iowa-Illinois at the Point of Connection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Facilities Schedules provide that they will be effective upon their acceptance for filing by the Commission.
Iowa-Illinois requests the Commission to accept the Facilities Schedules for filing by November 30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the filing were served upon the Illinois Commerce Commission, the Iowa Utilities Board and CIPCO.

Take notice that on August 8, 1994, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas), 3800 Frederica Street, Owensboro,
Kentucky 42301, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;702&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of
the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211) for authorization to add a new delivery
point in Grant Parish, Louisiana, under Texas Gas's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;407&hyph;000
pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Gas currently transports gas for delivery to Farmland Industries, Inc. (Farmland) at a meter located on Texas
Gas's Bastrop_Eunice pipeline system in Grant Parish, Louisiana (Wintershall_Farmland Meter). Such meter was
installed and is being operated under the authority of Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act (Section 311) and Section
284.3(c) of the Commission's Regulations. Texas Gas states that Farmland has recently indicated a need for greater
flexibility in the services that can be provided at this delivery point on Texas Gas's system. In particular, Farmland
would like to be able to receive at the Wintershall_Farmland Meter gas transported not only pursuant to Section 311,
but also pursuant to Texas Gas's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP88&hyph;686&hyph;000. By this filing,
Texas Gas is requesting authorization to change the status of this delivery point in order to be able to transport and
deliver gas on a jurisdictional basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Gas states that the quantity of gas to be delivered through this meter will vary; however, the design capacity
of the Wintershall_Farmland Meter is approximately 78,200 Mcf per day under normal operating conditions.

Take notice that on August 8, 1994, NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT), 1600 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002,
filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;706&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to abandon certain facilities
in Louisiana and Oklahoma under NGT's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;384&hyph;000, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGT proposes to abandon in place: 1) Line 632 having 30,071 feet of 2 to 6-inch pipe located in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma;
2) Line 632&hyph;12 having 4,421 feet of 2-inch pipe located in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma; and 3) a segment of Line
634 having 18,648 feet of 2 to 6-inch pipe located in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma. All lines are operated at low pressure
to provide service to rural domestic customers of ARKLA, a division of NorAm Energy Corporation (formerly Arkansas
Louisiana Gas Company) and ARKLA's Ada Townborder Station No. 2. NGT says that these lines are old, deteriorated,
and are no longer necessary for the delivery of gas to ARKLA. NGT proposes to transfer, by sale, minor segments of these
lines to ARKLA. No customers or service will be abandoned as a result of the abandonment of these facilities.

1 town border station in Juneau County, Wisconsin, to accommodate increased natural gas deliveries to serve the communities
of Wilton and Norwalk. Northern explains that MG&amp;E has requested the installation and upgrade of the delivery

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern estimates that the peak day and annual deliveries of gas at the Readstown TBS would be 1,461 and 150,000 MMBtu,
respectively. Furthermore, Northern estimates that the peak day and annual deliveries at the Elroy TBS would increase
from 889 to 2,250 MMBtu and from 100,000 to 300,000 MMBtu, respectively. Northern states that the end-users would
be residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Northern advises that the increased service would be provided
under currently effective transportation service agreements.

Take notice that on August 10, 1994, Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern), P.O. Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1188,
filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;710&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.212) for authorization to construct and operate a town
border station and appurtenant facilities to provide natural gas deliveries to Superior Water, Light and Power Company

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern proposes to construct and operate a town border station and appurtenant facilities in Douglas County, Wisconsin
to accommodate increased natural gas deliveries to SWL&amp;P for redelivery at Hawthorne, Wisconsin for commercial
and residential end use. Northern indicates that it would deliver 800 Mcf on a peak day and 160,000 Mcf annually through
the new town border station. Northern estimates that the facilities would cost $130,000, and indicates that the facilities
would be financed in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Northern's FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern states that the total volumes to be delivered to SWL&amp;P after this request do not exceed the total volumes
authorized prior to this request. Northern also states that it has sufficient system delivery flexibility to accomplish
these deliveries without detriment or disadvantage to its other customers. It is also stated that Northern's tariff
does not prohibit the addition of new delivery taps.

On August 9, 1994, pursuant to the settlement approved by the Commission in its December 30, 1993, Letter Order in this
proceeding, Alabama-Tennessee filed a tariff sheet which inadvertently contained an incorrect effective date
of October 1, 1994. Consistent with the intent of Alabama-Tennessee's August 9, filing Alabama-Tennessee's revised
tariff sheet filed herein contains the proper effective date of September 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alabama-Tennessee has requested such waiver of the Commission's regulations as may be necessary to accept and approve
its filing as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alabama-Tennessee states that copies of its filing were served upon the Company's jurisdictional customers and
interested public bodies as well as all the parties shown on the Commission's official service list established in
this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.
All such protests should be filed on or before August 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this
filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

Take notice that on August 12, 1994, Black Marlin Pipeline Company (Black Marlin) tendered for filing to become part

Black Marlin states that in conjunction with its implementation of Order 636 and in compliance with the Commission's
order dated October 14, 1993, in Docket No. RS92&hyph;56&hyph;002, Black Marlin filed its form of Electronic Bulletin
Board Subscriber Agreement (Subscriber Agreement) to become part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No.
1. Paragraph 3 of the Subscriber Agreement provides that EBB Customers will reimburse Black Marlin $135.61 plus applicable
taxes for licensing charges Black Marlin incurs to provide service. The licensing fees incurred by Black Marlin for
new customers have risen to $157.42 plus applicable taxes and will continue to change periodically.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Black Marlin states that it is filing herein to remove the fixed dollar amount from the form of Subscriber Agreement
in its tariff. Black Marlin states that it will continue to charge new EBB Customers only the actual charges incurred
by Black Marlin on their behalf, with no administrative or handling fees or other forms of consideration. The change
proposed herein will eliminate the need for a tariff filing each time the licensing fees are changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Black Marlin requests that the Commission grant any and all waivers of its rules, regulations, and orders as may be
necessary, specifically (but not limited to) Section 154.22 of the Commission's Regulations, so as to permit the
tariff sheets submitted herewith to become effective September f1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Black Marlin further states that copies of the filing have been mailed to each of its customers affected by this filing
and interested state commissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Sections
385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before
August 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken,
but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public

Take notice that on August 12, 1994, Black Marlin Pipeline Company (Black Marlin) tendered for filing to become part

Black Marlin states that in Order No. 636, et seq. the Commission permitted pipelines to allocate capacity on the basis
of economic value to shippers rather than on a first-come, first-served basis which had been established as the standard
under Order No. 436. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virtually all pipelines now schedule and curtail interruptible capacity based on the price, or rate, being paid for
such capacity with a pro rata allocation, if necessary, among shippers paying the same price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Black Marlin is not a capacity constrained pipeline and scheduling and curtailment priorities have not
been issues in the Black Marlin proceedings, Black Marlin states that it is filing herein to change and clarify the
operation of the scheduling and curtailment provisions of its tariff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The currently effective Section 9, Scheduling and Curtailment, of the General Terms and Conditions (GTC) of Black
Marlin's FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1 provides that scheduling and curtailment will be based on the
rate being paid for capacity within each scheduling and curtailment category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this Section also retains language regarding the first-come, first-served basis and priority dates which
were originally established pursuant to Order No. 436. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Black Marlin states that it is filing herein to eliminate language regarding the first-come, first-served methodology
and priority dates so that it is clear that scheduling and curtailment, within each scheduling and/or curtailment
category, on Black Marlin is done by price, and pro rata at each price level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Black Marlin requests that the Commission grant any and all waivers of its rules, regulations, and orders as may be
necessary, specifically (but not limited to) Section 154.22 of the Commission's Regulations, so as to permit the
tariff sheets submitted herewith to become effective September 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Black Marlin further states that copies of the filing have been mailed to each of its customers affected by this filing
and interested state commissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Sections
385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All such motions or protests should be filed on or before August 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.

Take notice that on August 15, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco), P.O. Box 1396, Houston,
Texas 77251&hyph;1396, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;714&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Sections 7(c) and
7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for (1) a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing certain river crossings,
and (2) an order permitting and approving the abandonment of existing facilities at the same location, all as more
fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transco states that it has three pipelines which cross the Amite River in Louisiana: (1) 30-inch diameter Main Line
A, (2) 36-inch diameter Main Line B and (3) 36-inch Maine Line C. Transco states that all gas produced onshore and offshore
Texas and Louisiana which flows through Transco's system to Transco's markets in the deep south, atlantic seaboard
and eastern markets flows through the Amite River crossing (with the exception of the gas attached to Transco's mainline
by way of the Southeast Louisiana Gathering System, which interconnects with Transco's mainline at Compressor Station
No. 65, located approximately 11 miles north of the Amite River).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transco states that because of river scouring, bank washing and channel meander/realignment, Main Line A is exposed.
It is indicated that Line A has been taken out of service because Transco is concerned that a significant flood event
could occur and rupture the line. It is also indicated that Main Lines B and C are not yet exposed, but Transco is concerned
that they would become exposed because the river is realigning in a southward direction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transco states that it cannot perform these replacements pursuant to Section 2.55(b) of the Commission's Regulations
because of the Commission's recent clarification of Section 2.55(b) in the order issued on May 12, 1994, in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Arkla Energy Resources Company, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Docket No. CP91&hyph;2069&hyph;000 (67 FERC &para;61,173), involving the issue of replacements outside of existing
right-of-way. Transco states that it is imperative that it complete the new crossings in time to provide service during
the upcoming winter heating season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transco states that it proposes to install approximately 2,700 feet of new 36-inch diameter Main Line B by horizontal
directional drilling under the Amite River, at the location of its existing pipeline crossing of the Amite River.
Transco indicates that directionally drilled pipeline are more secure than the older pipelines which were installed
by way of trenching the river bed. It is stated that approximately 225 feet of 36-inch diameter pipe would be conventionally
installed from the entrance of the bore on the east side of the river and tied in to existing Main Lines A and B by means
of a new manifold. It is also indicated that approximately 225 feet of 36-inch diameter pipe would be conventionally
installed from the exit of the bore on the west bank of the river and tied into existing Main Lines A and B by means of a new
manifold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transco states that it also proposes to install approximately 2,700 feet of new 36-inch diameter Main Line C by horizontal
directional drilling under the Amite River. It is indicated that approximately 225 feet of 36-inch diameter pipe
will be conventionally installed from the entrance of the bore on the east side of the river and tied into existing Main
Line Lines A, B, and C by means of the manifold mentioned above. It is also stated that approximately 225 feet of 36-inch
diameter pipe would be conventionally installed from the exit of the bore on the west side of the river and tied into
Main Lines A, B, and C by means of the manifold mentioned above.

Transco states that proposed replacements would restore the long-term integrity of Transco's transmission system
at the Amite River crossings. It is stated that system capacity across the Amite River after installation of the two
new river crossings would be 2,361,000 Mcf per day compared with a current capacity of 2,369,000 Mcf per day. Transco
states that the three existing pipelines would be retired and removed. Transco estimates the cost of installing both
new lines at approximately $6,000,000, to be financed initially through short-term loans and funds on hand, with
permanent financing to be undertaken at a later date. Transco estimates the cost of the removal work at $280,000.

Transco states that issuance of a certificate and construction clearance by September 15, 1994, is justified for
three reasons: (1) The need for security of gas service during the upcoming winter heating season, (2) historically,
during the months of August and September, it is expected that the Amite River floodplain would be dryer than at any
time of the year, and thus provide the most favorable conditions for the contractor's equipment, and (3) the

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before August
31, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate and permission for abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity.
If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing
is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Transco to appear or
be represented at the hearing.

 Under section 3(c)(2)(B) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), pesticide registrants
are required to report to EPA and keep records of data from studies relative to the pesticides which are currently registered
under FIFRA. Registrants, upon request, must submit to EPA reports of additional data necessary to maintain a current
registration of pesticides. The Agency uses the information to assess whether the subject pesticide causes an unreasonable
adverse effect on human health and the environment and to determine whether to maintain the registration.

 Information Collection Request (ICR) for Customer Satisfaction Surveys (EPA ICR No. 1711.01).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is a new information collection request seeking generic clearance for EPA customer surveys, in accordance with
the objectives of Executive Order (E.O.) 12862 ``Setting Customer Standards'' (September 11, 1993). The E.O. states
that ``...Federal agencies shall take steps to survey their customers for the purposes of determining the kind and
quality of services they want and measure the level of satisfaction with existing services.'' A subsequent OMB memorandum
to Federal agencies (September 29, 1993) encourages agencies to seek generic clearance through OMB for information
collection activities associated with customer surveys. This ICR fulfills the EPA's obligations under the E.O.
by providing an efficient, expedited clearance process within the EPA for customer surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA services (such as hotlines, information clearinghouses, public affairs offices) conducting customer service
surveys may request their customers to provide: (1) Identification information; and (2) opinion information related
to the quality, timeliness and value of their service. The EPA may gather this information through mail or telephone
questionnaires, or through focus interviews with selected customers. In addition, EPA programs that provide materials
(software, guidance documents, manuals, brochures) to the public may seek customer feedback through short self-addressed
customer feedback forms on distributed materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information will be used by the EPA to establish a baseline of information for developing strategies to improve
Agency services, and as a yardstick for measuring the success of these strategies over time.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Burden Statement:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 20 minutes for mail surveys, 10
minutes for customer feedback forms, 15 minutes for telephone surveys, and 2 hours for focus sessions, for an average
burden of 15 minutes per response including time for reviewing instructions, gathering and compiling the information,
and completing and reviewing the response.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Reinventing Environmental Management'' an Accompanying Report of the National Performance Review (NPR), clearly
makes the case that the Federal government's daily operation_how it manages the lands, buildings, and other facilities
that it owns or operates, has a significant impact on the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Performance Review recommended that the President issue a directive to require the use of environmentally
and economically beneficial landscaping for Federal lands and facilities and federally funded projects. The NPR
called upon the directive to increase the use of native plant species and to reduce the amount of chemicals applied
to Federal landscapes. The NPR also called for the use of water efficient technologies in Federal landscaping projects;
to provide educational and conservation opportunities to the public and to establish a government wide environmentally
sound landscape program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the NPR, on April 26, 1994, President Clinton signed a Presidential Memorandum. The Memorandum called
for the establishment of guidelines for Federal facility managers on how to increase the use of native species, reduce
the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and implement water conservation techniques. Those guidelines
will be proposed by a Federal Inter-Agency workgroup established by the Federal Environmental Executive. The purpose
of this notice is to request input from interested parties on factors that should be included in the guidance. This
notice provides a brief discussion of the particular sections of the Memorandum and issues which will be considered
when the guidance is proposed. The guidelines should allow for climatic and geographic differences, and should provide
a framework for agencies to consider as they plan their landscape requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Landscape Memorandum identifies five (5) priorities. Each of these have raised questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Use Regionally Native Plants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intent:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to incorporate native plants wherever practicable into landscape projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The use of native plants is encouraged because regionally native plants are believed to be regionally adapted to environmental
conditions, i.e. soils, precipitation, light, extreme cold or heat, etc. By planting native plants we are using plants
that are therefore more hardy and more likely to be self-reliant than non-native alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concerns:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) What is a native plant? Executive Order 11987 on Exotic Organisms, signed by President Carter on May 24, 1977, used
the following definition: ``all species of plants (and animals) naturally occurring, either presently or historically,
in any ecosystem in the United States.'' It has been suggested that the word ``presently'' be eliminated from the definition,
so as to avoid naturalized plants from being considered native. An alternative definition could be: ``all species,
indigenous to, or known to exist in a region at the time of European settlement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Do commercial sources of native plants and seed exist to meet this new demand? It is believed that a substantial
group of native plant and seed sources exists in the Midwest, Southwest and Southeast regions. However, other regions
cannot meet the new demand. How can we develop more sources for native plants and seeds? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Does the public understand the use of native plants enough to support this project? Can the public understand that
all cemeteries operated by the United States Government should not be covered with lush Kentucky Blue Grass? Can the
public understand that the government cannot afford to maintain roadsides as if they were the nation's front yards?
Can the public accept a new ecological aesthetic? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) How will agencies be provided training in the use and maintenance of planted native landscapes? Do the Agencies
currently have resources that could be diverted to this new training, or is the new program going to require additional
resources? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Under what conditions is the planting of native species practicable and appropriate? Should native species be
used primarily outside urban areas? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) How do we avoid weed free seeds, to avoid accidental introduction of non-natives, or aggressive exotic species
to a project? Are state agricultural seed standards strong enough? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Design, Use, or Promote Construction Practices that Minimize Adverse Effects on the Natural Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intent:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The language here seeks to: (1) Maintain and promote the existing natural habitat; (2) Minimize disturbance to the
natural habitat; and (3) Integrate design and construction of Federal projects with the surrounding natural habitat.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These principals are to be applied to federally funded projects where cost effective and to the extent practicable.
We do not envision major restoration of natural habitats to be accomplished under this executive memorandum, nor
do we envision that cost and time considerations will be sublimated in that effort. Instead, we envision that through
thoughtful design work, proper planning and quality construction, these goals will be achieved. Although first-cost
construction may be higher, overall costs may prove lower as costs for irrigation, maintenance, fertilization and
pest control may decline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concerns: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) What is the definition of `natural habitat'? This definition could embrace both ``native'' and ``existing''
habitat with the determination being site specific and made on a case-by-case basis. Is a ``Natural Habitat'' the
local association of plants adapted to the soil, topography and climate of an area that provide food and cover for indigenous
species of the area? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To what extent should we expend additional revenue in support of minimizing adverse impacts to the natural habitat?
Clearly, if the implementation of these principles produces lower costs and minimal or no impact to time delivery,
it will be readily accepted, but, measuring costs and cost-effectiveness can be subjective. Record keeping will
be imperative.

(3) What is the best method for getting appropriate design principles incorporated into Federal agency design specifications
and guidance, etc? In particular, how can we get landscape designs integrated with the natural habitat, incorporating
native plants, xeriscaping principles and water efficient irrigation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) How can we ensure that the principles and practices identified in the Executive Memorandum are implemented by
Federal agencies? Should this be the responsibility of each Agency's Environmental Executive (designated under
Executive Order 12873)?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Seek to Prevent Pollution By, Among Other Things, Reducing Fertilizer and Pesticide Use, Using Integrated Pest
Management Techniques, Recycling Green Waste, and Minimizing Runoff. Landscaping Practices that Reduce the Use
of Toxic Chemicals Provide One Approach for Agencies to Reach Reduction Goals Established in Executive Order No.
12856, ``Federal Compliance with Right-To-Know Laws and Pollution Prevention Requirements;''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Landscaping practices which do not require, or require only limited, application of fertilizer and/or pesticides
may result in significant prevention of pollution in several ways. First, and most conspicuous, any decreased need
for application decreases the likelihood that adverse environmental impacts associated with runoff of these chemicals
will occur. In addition, reduced need for chemical substances will decrease the amount of energy expended to produce
these chemicals. One practice, the use of integrated pest management, not only serves to reduce or eliminate the need
for pesticide application and thus prevent pollution, it generally results in significant reductions in unintended
impacts to non-target species, resulting in an secondary environmental benefit beyond pollution prevention. Additionally,
recycling of ``green waste'' results in a range of environmental benefits linked to pollution prevention. The collection,
composting and ultimate reuse of green wastes not only reduces the amount of materials placed in landfills, it decreases
and can eliminate the need for man-made fertilizers and thus reaps the same benefits as other such landscaping practices.
Finally, landscaping practices may serve a vital role in pollution prevention through the use of plants as barriers
to pollution and to absorb natural or man made pollutants which may otherwise enter natural systems such as waterbodies.
For example, buffer plantings along waterways act to absorb excess nutrients and chemical pollutants which might
otherwise enter waterways.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concerns: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) How can the Federal community best accomplish this task? Non-traditional landscaping practices such as integrated
pest management not only require training to be effective, they require acceptance on the part of facility managers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Implement Water-Efficient Practices, Such As the Use of Mulches, Efficient Irrigation Systems, Audits to Determine
Exact Landscaping Water-Use Needs, and Recycled or Reclaimed Water and the Selecting and Siting of Plants in A Manner
that Conserves Water and Controls Soil Erosion. Landscaping practices, Such As Planting Regionally Native Shade
Trees Around Buildings to Reduce Air Conditioning Demands, Can Also Provide Innovative Measures to Meet the Energy
Consumption Reduction Goal Established in Executive Order No. 12902, ``Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation
at Federal Facilities;''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Certain landscaping practices by design result in elimination or reduction of supplementary water needed to sustain
landscaped areas and prevent or reduce soil erosion. Practices such as the use of mulches which reduce evaporation
from landscaped areas and effective siting of landscape plantings can decrease the need for supplemental water and
prevent physical erosion of the soil. Other practices, such as efficient irrigation systems and water audits, ensure
that supplemental water is used most effectively and only when necessary. Additionally, the use of recycled or reclaimed
water offers an alternative to the use of potable water which both satisfies landscaping water needs and conserves
energy by decreasing the need for treated water. Finally, consideration of the natural shading effect associated
with landscape plantings can serve to reduce heat loadings on buildings and result in energy conservation. These
landscaping practices can conserve valuable water resources and energy and provide significant environmental
benefits to affected Federal property managers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concerns: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Since the use of non-traditional landscaping practices will require training to ensure success, how can the Federal
government ensure that facility managers are aware of, and accept, non-traditional water-efficient landscaping
practices? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Are there potential problems with the use of recycled or reclaimed water? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Likewise, are there potential problems with the use of recycled materials, i.e. newspaper and sludge?

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many Federal facilities have a significant acreage of open land which remains unused for facility buildings and infrastructure.
In many instances, the public is actively invited to use these lands for passive recreational purposes such as bird
watching, picnicking, or hiking. These areas, therefore present a significant opportunity to showcase the aesthetic
and economic effectiveness of environmentally beneficial landscaping. Demonstration projects allow both public
and private interests to experience the benefits of landscaping practices and apply those practices to their own
landscaping activities. Other technology and information transfer methods such as workshops and brochures can
also provide this benefit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concerns: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) In this era of restricted resources, will the public understand the use of public funds for landscaping demonstration
projects?

The Report of the National Performance Review contains recommendations for a series of environmental actions, including
one to increase environmentally and economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficial landscaping practices at Federal facilities and federally funded projects. Environmentally beneficial
landscaping entails utilizing techniques that complement and enhance the local environment and seek to minimize
the adverse effects that the landscaping will have on it. In particular, this means using regionally native plants
and employing landscaping practices and technologies that conserve water and prevent pollution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These landscaping practices should benefit the environment, as well as generate long-term costs savings for the
Federal Government. For example, the use of native plants not only protects our natural heritage and provides wildlife
habitat, but also can reduce fertilizer, pesticide,and irrigation demands and their associated costs because native
plants are suited to the local environment and climate.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1986, EPA published Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (51 FR 33992; September 24, 1986). Scientific advances
in both risk assessment and carcinogenesis have led EPA and the broader scientific community to new perspectives
on cancer risk assessment and related new perspectives on EPA's Cancer Risk Assessment Guidelines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its efforts to update and revise the 1986 Guidelines, the Agency will hold a workshop in Reston, Virginia,
on September 12&hyph;14, 1994, to discuss the major changes contemplated for these guidelines. At this meeting,
experts on cancer risk assessment and its associated sciences will comment on and discuss a working draft for revising
the 1986 cancer risk assessment guidelines. The workshop aims to produce recommendations to the Agency on the use
of default assumptions and wider application of mechanistic data in cancer risk assessment, among other things.

Hearing Designation Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

designates for hearing a formal complaint proceeding to resolve material questions of fact surrounding the American
Telephone and Telegraph Company's (AT&amp;T's) handling of an operator-assisted telephone call involving the
complainants in this case, Elehue Kawika Freemon and Lucille K. Freemon (together the Freemons or complainants).
The issue to be decided in the proceeding is whether AT&amp;T's actions violated Section 705 of the Communications
Act and, if so, whether the Freemons suffered any measurable harm as a consequence of such violations and are entitled
to an award of damages from AT&amp;T.

Synopsis of Hearing Designation Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Freemons filed a formal complaint with the Commission pursuant to Section 208 of the Act alleging that AT&amp;T
had violated Section 705 of the Act by monitoring the complainants' telephone conversation and disclosing its contents
or meaning. AT&amp;T disputes the legal and factual bases of the Freemons' claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. After submission of numerous pleadings and motions to the Commission and discovery by the parties directed at clarifying
the basis of their respective claims, both the facts and circumstances surrounding AT&amp;T's handling of the Freemons'
call are sharply disputed. Although neither AT&amp;T nor the Freemons has formally requested that the complaint
be designated for hearing, both have informally advised Commission staff that they view a hearing as the most appropriate
and expeditious way to resolve the issues raised by the complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Based on review of the record adduced in this matter, the Commission concluded that further proceedings are necessary
to resolve material questions of fact bearing on whether AT&amp;T violated Section 705 of the Communications Act
in connection with its handling of the complainants' operator-assisted call as described in the complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
it is ordered,

&sect;&sect;154(i), 154(j), 201, 206, 207, 208 and 209, that the above-captioned complaint proceeding is designated

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last

The Office of Small Business, Scientific, and Trade Affairs (OSSTA), Office of External Affairs (OEA), is being abolished.
In order to streamline FDA's organization structure, FDA intends to abolish a number of organizations in keeping
with this Administration's reinventing government initiatives. The OSSTA is being abolished to reduce the number
of organizations reporting to the Deputy Commissioner for External Affairs. The small business functions will be
performed within the OEA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final criteria for meeting the general statutory
funding preference for fiscal year (FY) 1994 Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships under the authority
of section 831(b), title VIII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice
Improvement Amendments of 1992, title II of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public
Law 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 831(b) of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to make grants to provide financial assistance
to certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA) who are faculty members in accredited programs to enable such
nurse anesthetists to obtain advanced education relevant to their teaching functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statutory Funding Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 860(e) of the PHS Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement Amendments of 1992, title
II of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408, enacted on October
13, 1992, provides for the following statutory preference for this program of Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty
Fellowships, as well as for certain other programs under titles VII and VIII of the PHS Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statutory preference will be given to qualified applicants that: (1) Have a high rate for placing graduates in practice
settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (2) have achieved,
during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, a significant increase in the
rate of placing graduates in such settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of applications that have
been recommended for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Final Criteria for Meeting the General Statutory Funding Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 59 FR 25463 on May 16, 1994 to announce the FY 1994 grant cycle for this program and to propose the criteria for meeting
the general statutory funding preference. No comments were received during the 30 day comment period. Therefore,
the criteria for meeting the general statutory funding preference remain as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships, qualified applicants will meet the general statutory funding
preference if a minimum of 50% of the nurse anesthetist faculty are teaching in medically underserved communities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to achieve the goal of increasing the communication and collaboration among HUD, universities and local
communities, the Secretary has determined to create a new Office of University Partnerships within the Office of
the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. The purpose of this office is to strengthen HUD's ties
with academic institutions because of the ideas and research they can offer in the making of policy, and because of
their role in training the next generation of urban scholars and professionals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the creation of this new office, certain HUD programs which belong within it need to be relocated under the Assistant
Secretary for Policy Development and Research. These programs include the Work Study Program, the Community Outreach
Partnerships Program, and the Joint Community Development Program. Prior to when these delegations have taken,
and will take, effect, they were administered within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning
and Development. It is noted that the power and authority of the Secretary under the Work Study Program shall not be
delegated to the Assistant Secretary for PD&amp;R until September 6, 1994. This is in order to best serve the needs
of the public due to the present stage of the funding and review process for this program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains a notice of pendency before the Department of Labor (the Department) of a proposed class exemption
from certain prohibited transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA or the Act)
and from certain taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code). If granted, the proposed exemption
would exempt prospectively and retroactively to January 1, 1975, certain transactions engaged in by insurance company
general accounts in which an employee benefit plan has an interest, if certain specified conditions are met. Additional
exemptive relief is proposed for plans to engage in transactions with persons who provide services to insurance company
general accounts. The proposal would also permit transactions relating to the origination and operation of certain
asset pool investment trusts in which a general account has an interest as a result of the acquisition of certificates
issued by the trust. The proposed exemption, if granted, would affect participants and beneficiaries of employee
benefit plans, insurance company general accounts, as well as other persons engaging in the described transactions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains a notice of pendency before the Department of a proposed class exemption from certain of the
restrictions of sections 406 and 407 of ERISA and from certain taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code,
by reason of section 4975(c)(1) of the Code. The proposed exemption was requested in an application dated March 25,
1994, submitted by the American Council of Life Insurance (the ACLI)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 pursuant to section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and in accordance with procedures set forth
in 29 CFR section 2570 subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990). In addition, the Department is proposing additional
relief on its own motion pursuant to the authority described above.

Life insurance companies issue a variety of group contracts for use in connection with employee pension benefit plans,
some of which provide benefits the amount of which is guaranteed, some of which provide benefits that may fluctuate
with the investment performance of the insurance company, and some of which offer elements of both. Under section
401(b)(2) of ERISA, if an insurance company issues a ``guaranteed benefit policy'' to a plan, the assets of the plan
are deemed to include the policy, but do no, solely by reason of the issuance of the policy, include any of the assets
of the insurance company. Section 401(b)(2)(B) defines the term ``guaranteed benefit policy'' to mean an insurance
policy or contract to the extent that such policy or contract provides for benefits the amount of which is guaranteed
by the insurer. In addition, in ERISA Interpretive Bulletin 75&hyph;2, 29 CFR 2509.75&hyph;2, the Department stated
that if an insurance company issues a contract or policy of insurance to a plan and places the consideration for such
contract or policy in its general asset account, the assets in such account shall not be considered to be plan assets.

On December 13, 1993, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harris Trust.)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Supreme Court held that those funds allocated to an insurer's general account pursuant to a contract with a plan
that vary with the investment experience of the insurance company are ``plan assets'' under ERISA. As a result, the
Court concluded that Hancock was a fiduciary with respect to the management and disposition of such funds. Under the
reasoning of this decision, a broad range of activities involving insurance company general accounts are subject
to ERISA's fiduciary standards.

decision, the insurance industry, following adoption of IB 75&hyph;2, operated under the assumption that general
account assets were not plan assets, and thus, were not subject to ERISA's fiduciary responsibility provisions.
As a result of the retroactive effect of the Supreme Court decision, numerous transactions engaged in by insurance
company general accounts may have violated ERISA's prohibited transaction provisions. The insurance industry
believes that, absent exemptive relief, it will be subject to significant additional litigation with respect to
the operation of its general accounts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ACLI represents that presently, of the $1.5 trillion in general account assets of domestic life insurance companies,
more than $558 billion relate to life insurance, health insurance and a broad variety of annuity products purchased
by employee benefit plans. General account contracts, unlike all other investment and funding vehicles offered
to plans, provide risk pooling, guarantees of principal and rates of return, as well as benefit guarantees, all of
which are backed by every dollar in the general account. The Applicant further states that it is this pooling and assumption
of risk that distinguish insurance companies from typical investment firms and for which the state insurance regulatory
agencies impose stringent reserve and capital requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like any other business, insurance companies have developed new products to compete in an ever changing marketplace.
In the pension area, various forms of participating general account contracts, especially deposit administration
and immediate participation guarantee contracts, were specifically developed to be responsive to the expressed
needs of plan sponsors. The ACLI states that even before enactment of ERISA, participating general account contracts
provided a unique balance of investment participation and protection, as well as many billions of dollars of benefits
to plan participants and beneficiaries. Participating contracts allow contractholders to share in the general
accounts' favorable investment, mortality and morbidity experience, to obtain protection from unfavorable experience,
and to provide certainty and dependability for the payment of benefits to participants and beneficiaries. According
to the ACLI, these factors have enabled plan sponsors to fund their benefit promises and to increase the benefits to
plan participants and beneficiaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Supreme Court rendered its decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harris Trust
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the legal landscape applicable to general account activities has been significantly altered. The ACLI represents
that the Court's decision has created uncertainty regarding the status of general account operations and activities
under ERISA-governed plans and will have a long-term adverse effect on plan participants, the U.S. economy and the
insurance industry in the absence of exemptive relief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ACLI notes that insurance companies invest approximately $675 billion of general account assets in the economy
each year and that this is one of the largest sources of capital available in the United States, particularly for smaller
and medium-sized businesses which are the source of most of the new job creation in our country. The Applicant states
that the decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harris Trust
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has begun to slow, if not totally disrupt, the nation's capital markets. Investment bankers, brokers and banks, as
well as insurance companies, are all now hesitant to engage in common, commercially reasonable and economically
beneficial business transactions for fear of inadvertently violating ERISA's prohibited transaction restrictions.
The Applicant believes that without the relief requested in its application, many ordinary practices of the insurance
industry could be called into question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ACLI has requested unconditional retroactive relief from January 1, 1975, for all transactions that may be viewed
as having been prohibited because insurance company general accounts may have held plan assets, as well as certain
other transactions that may be viewed as having become prohibited merely as the result of an ERISA covered plan's purchase
of a participating general account contract. The ACLI states that, although it is not possible to identify with specificity
the types of transactions to be covered by the proposed exemption, such transactions would include (but are not limited
to) the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) all internal operations of the general account (internal transactions); (B) all investment transactions involving
general account assets, including transactions between the general account and a party in interest with respect
to a plan that has purchased a general account contract; and (C) the purchase by the general account of securities issued
by and real property leased to employers of employees covered by plans that have purchased general account contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Internal Transactions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ACLI represents that general accounts engage in a variety of internal activities which, given the application
of ERISA, could potentially be viewed as prohibited. For example, income and losses generated by general account
investments are allocated among lines of business (or, where applicable, among segments) or to surplus. Decisions
must be made regarding the use of surplus, i.e., whether and to what extent to use surplus to pay dividends to policyholders
or stockholders. In addition, general operational business decisions relating to salaries and benefits for the
employees of the insurer, the provision of office space and materials, advertising expenses, charitable contributions,
etc., could also be transactions subject to ERISA due to the pooled nature of general account assets. Thus, the ACLI
represents that conceivably any of the myriad of decisions made by an insurance company regarding the structuring
or internal operation of its business would need exemptive relief. In addition, the ACLI notes that many insurance
companies use affiliates to provide investment management or property management services with regard to general
account properties and assets.

Investment Transactions With Third Parties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant represents that due to the pooled nature of general account assets, it is conceivable that general account
investment transactions with persons who are parties in interest with respect to ERISA-governed plans which have
purchased participating general account contracts (external transactions) could be viewed as subject to the prohibited
transaction rules of ERISA. For example insurance companies are currently the most significant source of loans for
smaller and mid-sized companies in today's market. Many, if not all, of those companies have party in interest relationships
with plans that have purchased general account contracts. Application of ERISA's prohibited transaction provisions
would have an adverse impact on the primary source of credit for these companies. The ACLI further represents that
application of the prohibited transaction rules in this case could, therefore, call into question almost every investment
transaction by insurance company general accounts since the January 1, 1975, effective date of the ERISA fiduciary
provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant states that the relief needed for general account investment transactions would be similar to the broad
relief provided in Prohibited Transaction Exemption 78&hyph;19, 43 Fed. Reg. 59915 (December 22, 1978), as amended
and redesignated in PTE 90&hyph;1, 55 Fed. Reg. 2891, (January 29, 1990). PTE 90&hyph;1 provides conditional relief
for certain transactions between insurance company pooled separate accounts in which plans have an interest and
parties in interest with respect to those plans.

Section I(a) of PTE 90&hyph;1 exempts from the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(2) and 407(a) of ERISA and
the taxes imposed by section 4975(a) and (b) of the Code, by reason of section 4975 (c)(1)(A) through (D) of the Code:

that various other transactions would need retroactive relief as a result of the potential plan asset treatment of
general account assets.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the years, there have been literally thousands of persons and entities that have provided services to insurance
companies. According to the ACLI, because of the size of insurance company general accounts, the number of service
providers raises the possibility of countless, technical prohibited transactions which have posed no possibility
of abuse. Thus, the ACLI requests relief for transactions that would be prohibited merely because a person is deemed
to be a party in interest to a plan solely by reason of providing services to the general account (or who has a relationship
with such service providers described in sections 3(14) (F), (G), (H), or (I) of ERISA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ACLI further represents that, under the Department's plan assets regulation, 29 CFR &sect;2510.3&hyph;101(f)(2)(iii),
an insurance company investing general account assets could be viewed as a ``benefit plan investor'' for the purposes
of calculating the 25 percent significant participation test in section 2510.3&hyph;101(f)(1) of the regulation.
This could increase the number of entities that would hold plan assets as the result of a general account equity investment
in an entity, and thereby also increase the number of possible prohibited transactions.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The ACLI notes that, as a further consequence of the general account's investment in an entity, the manager of the entity
(and other service providers to the entity) might be deemed to be fiduciaries or other parties in interest under section
3(14) of ERISA. Therefore, the ACLI requests broad relief for transactions that would be prohibited solely because
an entity has significant participation by benefit plan investors as a result of equity investments by general account(s).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the Department's view that, for purposes of determining whether equity participation in an entity by benefit
plan investors is ``significant'' within the meaning of the significant participation test contained in the plan
assets regulation, 29 CFR &sect;2510.3&hyph;101(f), only the proportion of an insurance company general account's
equity investment in the entity that represents plan assets should be taken into account. Therefore, the proportion
of that investment that represents plan assets would equal the proportion of the insurance company general account
as a whole that constitutes plan assets.

Employer Securities and Employer Real Property
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant represents that the breadth of general account investment activities over the last 20 years makes it
likely that insurance companies have purchased and continued to hold for their general accounts, securities issued
by or properties leased to employers of employees covered by plans that purchased general account contracts. Because
insurance companies have made such investments with the understanding that general account assets were not plan
assets, it is possible that general account investments include securities issued by employers, and real property
leased to employers, that do not meet the standards set forth in section 407(a) of ERISA. The ACLI also believes that
relief is necessary for the acquisition or holding of qualifying employer securities or qualifying real property
by a plan under circumstances where the acquisition or holding contravenes sections 406 and 407(a) solely by reason
of being aggregated with employer securities or employer real property held by an insurance company general account
in which the plan holds an interest as a contractholder. The Applicant notes that the relief requested for such ``excess
holdings'' is similar to the relief provided for pooled separate accounts in section I(c) of PTE 90&hyph;1.

The Proposed Exemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scope of the exemption being proposed by the Department differs from that requested by the Applicant. As previously
noted, the Department has granted a class exemption for insurance company pooled separate accounts that provides
relief from ERISA's prohibited transaction provisions for a variety of transactions between separate accounts
and parties in interest with respect to plans participating in such accounts. The Department has decided to propose
similar relief, as described below, with respect to insurance company general account transactions to the extent
that it believes that the requirements of section 408(a) of ERISA would be met. On its own motion, the Department is
also proposing relief for certain transactions involving the operation of certain asset pool investment trusts.
However, as more fully discussed below, the Department is not prepared at this time to propose several additional
exemptions requested by the Applicant.

After considering the ACLI's requested exemption for activities in connection with the internal operation of general
accounts, the Department has determined that it does not have sufficient information regarding the operation of
such accounts to make the findings required by section 408(a)
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 of ERISA. In a letter dated May 20, 1994, the Department has requested from the ACLI the necessary information by posing
a number of questions concerning the internal operations of general accounts. In that letter, the Department indicated
that it would proceed with its review of their application as it pertains to the external transactions while awaiting
their response to the questions.

Section 408(a) of ERISA provides, among other things, that the Department may grant an exemption from the prohibited
transaction rules only if finds that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and
of its participants and beneficiaries, and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of such plan.

In addition to requesting broad retroactive relief for general account transactions, the ACLI application also
requests relief for certain other transactions that may be viewed as being prohibited under the Supreme Court's analysis
in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 merely as a result of a plan's purchase of a participating general account contract. As previously noted, the significant
participation test contained in the plan asset regulation (section 2510.3&hyph;101) is a ``safe harbor'' provision
which provides that the assets of an entity will be considered to include plan assets only if equity participation
by ``benefit plan investors'' is ``significant''. The ACLI represents that, under regulation section 2510.3&hyph;101(f)(2),
an insurance company investing general account assets in an entity could be viewed as a benefit plan investor for the
purposes of calculating the 25 percent significant participation test. As a result, transactions between the entity
and a party in interest to a plan with an interest in the general account could be prohibited under section 406 of ERISA.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the ACLI seeks broad exemptive relief for transactions that would be prohibited solely because an entity
is deemed to hold plan assets under the significant participation test as the result of an insurance company general
account investment in such entity.

General Exemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption consists of six separate parts. Section I sets forth the basic exemption and enumerates certain
conditions applicable to transactions described therein. Sections II and III of the proposal set forth three specific
exemptions. Section IV contains the general conditions applicable to transactions described in sections I and II.
Section V contains definitions for certain terms used in the proposed exemption. Section VI sets forth the effective
date of the exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Section I
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The general exemption set forth in section I would provide an exemption from the restrictions of sections 406(a) and
407(a) for: (1) any transaction between a party in interest with respect to a plan and an insurance company general
account, in which the plan has an interest as a contractholder; (2) any acquisition or holding by the general account
of employer securities or employer real property; and (3) any acquisition or holding of qualifying employer securities
or qualifying employer real property by a plan (other than through an insurance company general account) if the acquisition
or holding contravenes the restrictions of sections 406(A)(1)(E), 406(a)(2) and 407(a) of ERISA solely by reason
of being aggregated with employer securities or employer real property held by an insurance company general account.
The above exemptions are subject to the requirement that the plan's participation in the general account as measured
by the amount of the reserves arising from the contract held by the plan, (determined under section 807(d) of the Code)
does not exceed 10% of all liabilities of the general account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ACLI stated that it would be unfair to retroactively impose a percentage limitation in the requested exemption.
In this regard, the Applicant represents that the level of insurance company general account investments activities
and the breadth of general account holdings are so great that it would effectively preclude any single plan contractholder
from exerting any undue influence over the decisions of an insurance company. Nevertheless, the Department has decided
to reject the ACLI's recommendation that a percentage limitation not be imposed as a condition to broad exemptive
relief. In the past, the Department has conditioned the availability of a number of class exemptions providing similar
broad relief on a plan's interest in a collective fund or account not exceeding a specified percentage amount. The
Department continues to believe that a plan that provides a significant percentage of an entity's business would,
in many cases, be in a position to improperly influence the investment decisions of the entity. In any event, it does
not appear that compliance with such a condition would be difficult in light of the apparent size of most general accounts.

Section II
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section II is divided into two subparts. Section II(a) of the proposed exemption would permit transactions involving
persons who are parties in interest to a plan solely by reason of providing services to an insurance company general
account in which the plan has an interest as a contractholder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on precedents established in several class and individual exemptions the Department is proposing an exemption,
in section II(b), that permits the furnishing of services, facilities and any goods incidental to such services and
facilities by a place of public accommodation owned by an insurance company general account to parties in interest
if the services, facilities and incidental goods are furnished on a comparable basis to the general public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the regular operations of places of public accommodation, such as hotels and motels, that may be purchased by an
insurance company general account, many people, including parties in interest with respect to plans which have participating
contracts with the general account, may receive use of such rooms, service, food, etc. Such hotels and motels will
typically be managed by hotel management companies who probably would not be aware of the relationship of the hotel
and motel guests to the insurance company and the plans who purchased general account contracts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequent to the filing of the ACLI exemption application, the Department has received several suggestions with
respect to any exemption that may result from the Department's consideration of the ACLI request. While expressing
general endorsement for the exemption requested by the ACLI with respect to the operation of entities that are deemed
to hold plan assets under section 2510.3&hyph;101(f) as a result of an insurance company general account investment,
one commenter specifically focused on the impact of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harris Trust
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision on a number of exemptions previously granted by the Department for the operation of asset pool investment
trusts that issue asset-backed, pass-through certificates to plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PTE 83&hyph;1 (48 FR 895, January 7, 1983) provides conditional relief for the operation of certain mortgage pool
investment trusts and the acquisition and holding by plans of certain mortgage-backed pass-through certificates
evidencing interests therein. The Department also granted a large number of individual exemptions (e.g., PTE 89&hyph;88
[54 FR 42581, October 17, 1989]), each of which provides substantially identical relief for the operation of certain
asset pool investment trusts and the acquisition and holding by plans of certain asset-based pass-through certificates
representing interests in those trusts (collectively, the Underwriter Exemptions).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PTE 83&hyph;1 and the Underwriter Exemptions are conditioned, among other things, upon the certificates purchased
by plans not being subordinated to other classes of certificates issued by the same trust. The commenter further noted
that, in a typical asset pool investment trust, one or more classes of subordinated certificates are often issued.
Underwriters and issuers will sell senior certificates to plans in reliance on PTE 83&hyph;1 and the Underwriter
Exemptions, but will not knowingly sell any of the subordinated certificates to plans. Thus, the Above-described
exemptions provide relief for the operation of a pool that sells senior certificates to plans, but provide no relief
for the same acts of the pool trustee and servicer if plans purchase subordinated certificates issued by the same trust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter stated that life insurance companies have been significant purchasers of subordinated certificates.
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harris Trust
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision raises the potential for servicers and trustees of pools to be subject to excise taxes and civil penalty liability
for the same acts involving the operation of trusts which would be exempt if the certificates were not subordinated.
Accordingly, the commenter believes that exemptive relief is especially appropriate in situations where insurance
company general account investments in subordinated classes of certificates causes plan ownership of such classes
to equal or exceed 25 percent.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 In support of this request for specific relief, the commenter provided the following reasons: (1) asset pool investment
trusts are fixed pools, the assets of which are generally not subject to change once the certificates are sold; (2)
the pool sponsor's discretion and the servicer's discretion with respect to assets included in a trust are severely
limited and are governed by a written pooling and servicing agreement that is available to investors prior to purchasing
a certificate; (3) the assets in the trusts represent secured obligations; and (4) trustees of asset pool investment
trusts must be independent of the pool sponsors. Moreover, the commenter argued that the fact that the certificates
acquired by a general account are subordinated should not preclude the Department from providing exemptive relief
since the certificates will have been analyzed by insurance company purchasers, who are presumptively sophisticated
investors.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that the commenter's recommendation has merit and has determined to propose exemptive relief
on its own motion. Section III of the proposal would provide relief from sections 406(a), 406(b), and 407(a) of ERISA
for the operation of asset pool investment trusts in which the insurance general account has an interest as a result
of the acquisition of subordinated certificates.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal requires that the conditions of either PTE 83&hyph;1 or an applicable Underwriter Exemption be met other
than the requirements that the certificates acquired by the general account not be subordinated and receive a rating
that is in one of the three highest generic rating categories from an independent rating agency. In addition, the Department
has proposed additional relief for the operation of such trusts where a plan acquired subordinated certificates
in a transaction that was not prohibited or otherwise satisfied the conditions of PTE 75&hyph;1. The department has
proposed this exemption in recognition that no relief would be available for the operation of a trust if a plan purchased
subordinated certificates in a transaction that was not prohibited (or was otherwise covered by PTE 75&hyph;1) and
the underlying assets of the trust includes plan assets under the analysis adopted in the

Section IV contains general conditions which are applicable to all transactions described in sections I and II of
the proposed exemption. Transactions must be at least as favorable to the insurance company general account as arm's-length
transactions between unrelated parties. The proposal would also require that the transaction not be part of any agreement,
arrangement, or understanding designed to benefit a party in interest. Lastly, the party in interest entering into
the transaction cannot be the insurance company, any pooled separate account of the insurance company, or any affiliate
of the insurance company.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply and
the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act which require, among other things, that
a fiduciary discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries;

(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries, and protective of the rights of the participant and beneficiaries;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If granted, the proposed class exemption will be applicable to a particular transaction only if the transaction
satisfies the conditions specified in the class exemption; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed exemption, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Code and Act, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the face
that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction
is in fact a prohibited transaction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For purposes of this exemption, the time as of which any transaction, acquisition, or holding occurs is the date
upon which the transaction is entered into, the acquisition is made or the holding commences. In addition, in the case
of a transaction that is continuing, the transaction shall be deemed to occur until it is terminated. If any transaction
is entered into, or acquisition made, on or after January 1, 1975, or any renewal that requires the consent of the insurance
company occurs on or after January 1, 1975, and the requirements of this exemption are satisfied at the time the transaction
is entered into or renewed, respectively, or at the time the acquisition is made, the requirements will continue to
be satisfied thereafter with respect to the transaction or acquisition and the exemption shall apply thereafter
to the continued holding of the securities or property so acquired. This exemption also applies to any transaction
or acquisition entered into or renewed, or holding commencing prior to January 1, 1975, if either the requirements
of this exemption would have been satisfied on the date the transaction was entered into or acquisition was made (or
on which the holding commenced), or the requirements would have been satisfied on January 1, 1954 if the transaction
had been entered into, the acquisition was made, or the holding had commenced, on January 1, 1975. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this exemption shall cease to apply to a transction or holding exempt by virtue of section I(a) or section
I(b) at such time as the interest of the plan in the insurance company general account exceeds the percentage interest
limitation contained in section I(a), unless no portion of such excess results from an increase in the assets allocated
to the insurance company general account by the plan. For this purpose, assets allocated do not include the reinvestment
of general account earnings. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as exempting a transaction entered into
by an insurance company general account which becomes a transaction described in section 406 of the Act or section
4975 of the Code while the transaction is continuing, unless the conditions of the exemption were met either at the
time the transaction was entered into or at the time the transaction would have become prohibited but for this exemption.

Georgia Power Company, et al; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF&hyph;68 and NPF&hyph;81 issued to Georgia Power Company, Ogelthorpe Power Corporation Municipal
Electric Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee) for operation of the Vogtle Electric Generating
Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Burke County, Georgia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would revise the values of Z and S for the Pressurized Pressure-Low and -High reactor trip setpoints
(Technical Specification Table 2.2&hyph;1, Functional Units 9 and 10, respectively) to allow the use of alternate
types of pressure transmitters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change revises the allowances Z and S in Technical Specification Table 2.2&hyph;1 for the Pressurizer
Pressure-Low and -High trip setpoints (Table 2.2&hyph;1, Functional Units 9 and 10) to allow the use of Tobar, Veritrak,
or Rosemount pressure transmitters. Also, the corresponding values of Z and S for the Pressurizer Pressure-Low setpoint
for safety injection actuation (Table 3.3&hyph;3, Functional Unit 1d) are bounding for these pressure transmitters.
The allowances for Z and S are not assumed in any of the initiating events for the accident analyses. Therefore, the
probability of any accident previously evaluated will not be affected by the proposed changes. Furthermore, the
setpoints, allowable values, and total allowances are not affected. Since the total allowances are not affected,
it is ensured that the safety analysis limits for the trips are not affected. Therefore, the proposed change does not
involve a significant increase in the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety function provided by the reactor trips and safety injection actuation and the manner in which the plant
is operated are not affected. The setpoints, allowable values, and total allowances are not affected. Since the total
allowances are not affected, it is ensured that the safety analysis limits for the trips are not affected. Thus, this
change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does this change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For both the reactor trips and safety injection actuation, there are no changes to the setpoints. The total allowance
for each setpoint is the difference between the safety analysis limit and the setpoint. Since the total allowances
are not affected, there are no changes to the safety analysis limits. Therefore the proposed change will not involve
a reduction in margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By September 21, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the
subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes
to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules
of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy
of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Burke County Library, 412 Fourth Street,
Waynesboro, Georgia 30830. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition
for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how
that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons
why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's
right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,
or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding
on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the
proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or
who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the
first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity
requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding,
a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which
are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or
fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the
contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which
the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references
to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely
to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine
dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within
the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven,, would entitle the petitioner
to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least
one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Herbert N. Berkow: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition
was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Mr. Arther H. Domby, Troutman Sanders, NationsBank Plaza, 600 Peachtree Street, NE.,
Atlanta, Georgia 30308, attorney for the licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)_(v) and 2.714(d).

On February 3, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal subsequently was amended eight times. On April 14, 1993, May 7, 1993, May 13, 1993, May 14, 1993, August
26, 1993, October 21, 1993,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 April 14, 1994, and July 27, 1994, the NASD filed Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively, to the proposed
rule change.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rule change would amend Article III, Section 34 of the Rules of Fair Practice to include rules which prevent
NASD members or persons associated with an NASD member from participating in any ``limited partnership rollup transaction''
(as defined in the proposed rule change) unless the transaction includes certain specified provisions designed
to protect the rights of limited partners. The proposed rule change also would amend Article III, Section 34(b)(6)
to narrow the scope of transactions in which members are forbidden to receive differential compensation (``Differential
Compensation Amendment''). Finally, the proposed rule change would amend Schedule D of the By-Laws (``Schedule
D'') to prohibit the authorization for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market (``Nasdaq/NM'') of any security which
results from a covered partnership rollup transaction unless the transaction was conducted in accordance with certain
specified procedures designed to protect the rights of dissenting limited partners.

Amendment No. 1 superseded the original rule filing. Amendment No. 2 amended the rule language and the NASD's Statement
of Purpose in response to comments of the Commission staff. Amendment Nos. 3 and 4 made technical changes to the rule.
Notice of the proposed rule change (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32312, May 17, 1993) was then published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 29655, May 21, 1993). Amendment No. 5 made technical changes to the rule text and responded to the comment letters
that the Commission received in response to the publication of the release in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
. Amendment No. 6 made changes to the rule text to address issues of state law addressed in comment letters. Amendment
No. 7 amended the rule language to partially conform the rule to the Rollup Reform Act and narrowed the scope of transactions
in which members were forbidden to receive differential compensation. Amendment No. 8 amended the rule language
to conform the rule to the Rollup Reform Act in all relevant parts and reordered the text of the proposed rule change
in accordance with Section 34 of the Rules of Fair Practice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice of the proposed rule change, together with the substance of the proposal as amended by Amendment Nos. 1&hyph;4,
was provided by the issuance of a Commission release (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32312, May 17, 1993) and
by publication in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 29655, May 21, 1993). Seven comment letters were received in response to the Commission release. Three comment
letters expressed support for the proposed rule change.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 One comment letter stated that the proposed rule change should not be adopted ``in the absence of a legislative mandate.''
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Three comment letters neither supported nor opposed the proposed rule change but offered suggestions on how to enhance
the NASD's rule.

The Rollup Reform Act was enacted on December 17, 1993, as part of the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993.
Section 3(a) of the Rollup Reform Act added subparagraph (12) to Section 15A(b) of the Exchange Act to require that
the rules of a registered securities association prevent members of the association from participating in any limited
partnership rollup transaction unless the transaction provides procedures to protect certain rights of limited
partners. Section 3(c) of the Rollup Reform Act amended Section 15A(b) of the Exchange Act to require that the rules
of a registered securities association prohibit the authorization for quotation on an automated interdealer quotation
system sponsored by the association of any security designated by the SEC as a national market system security resulting
from a rollup transaction, unless the transaction provides certain rights for limited partners.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The NASD subsequently amended the proposed rule change to conform the language of the rule to the Rollup Reform Act.

The Differential Compensation Amendment would eliminate the definition of ``rollup of a direct participation program''
contained in Subsections (b)(6)(A) and (B) of Article III, Section 34, which prohibits the receipt of differential
compensation in connection with the solicitation of investor votes in rollup transactions, and substitute the term
``limited partnership rollup transaction'' wherever the term ``roll-up of a direct participation program'' currently
appears in these Subsections. The effect would be to permit NASD members to receive diffential compensation in connection
with the solicitation of investor votes in any ``roll-up of a direct participation program'' that does not also constitute
a ``limited partnership rollup transaction.'' See infra Section III.B.1.

During the 1980s, over $150 billion of public limited partnership interests were sold to U.S. investors.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Sources have estimated that 11 million investors have purchased limited partnership interests, of which approximately
eight million are small investors, with an average investment of about $10,000.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Limited partnership interests typically are risky and illiquid, due to the lack of an active trading market for such
interests.

A. Structure of A Limited Partnership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the typical publicly-offered limited partnership, a sponsoring organization solicits funds from investors
to use in the purchase of real estate, oil and gas facilities, high technology research, or other enterprises. The
sponsor usually serves as the general partner and is required to manage the assets and fulfill any obligations to the
investors imposed under the terms of the partnership agreement. The investors are the limited partners. A partnership
agreement typically will provide for limited partners to receive periodic payments during the term of their investment,
a return of their principal, and a specified return or profit and a portion of any additional proceeds upon the liquidation
of the partnership assets.

B. Reasons to Invest in a Limited Partnership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Investors purchased limited partnerships for several reasons. Perhaps most important, in the case of real estate
partnerships prior to the 1986 amendments to the Internal Revenue Code (''1986 Tax Act''), limited partnership investors
enjoyed significant tax benefits.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Limited partnerships permitted small investors to participate in commercial and multi-family real estate, oil
and gas facilities, and other investments previously limited to institutional or other large investors.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Investors in limited partnerships were promised that they would realize a return on their investment within a finite
period of time. Investors also were promised that sponsors would not realize any return on partnership assets until
investors received their share of the profits.

C. Advantages for partnership sponsors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sponsors have a financial incentive to organize limited partnerships for at least two reasons. First, the sponsor/general
partner expects to realize a profit on any appreciation of the assets after the limited partners receive their share.
Second, the sponsor/general partner derives income on an on-going basis for the management services provided in
maintaining and operating the property. The general partner also may receive up-front fees for organizing the limited
partnership.

D. Recent partnership performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In the late 1980s, the financial climate for limited partnership deteriorated dramatically. Several factors contributed
to limited partnerships' poor performance. The 1986 Tax Act took away any tax benefit for limited partnership investors.
Real estate and oil and gas markets also declined precipitously. This, together with a series of other circumstances,
caused many general partners to face a decreasing revenue base and a growing number of financial problems.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Since January 1, 1985, the number of limited partnership offerings filed with the Commission has decreased substantially
each year, from a high of 428 in 1985 to a low of 39 in 1991.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Interests in limited partnerships investing in real estate lost some or all of their economic value due to the dramatic
decline in real estate values during the late 1980s.

Several consequences flowed from the deteriorating climate for limited partnerships. Many general partners stopped
raising new capital altogether. Sales of assets from existing partnerships exceeded any new capital raised, thereby
eroding assets under management and significantly reducing general partner management fees.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 Some general partners responded to their predicament by changing the original partnership agreements and restructuring
the limited partnerships by proposing to reorganize or, in many cases, ``roll up'' existing limited partnership
interests into new, publicly-traded securities.

E. Rollups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From January 1, 1985 to June 30, 1994, approximately 82 limited partnership rollup transactions involving two or
more entities were registered with the Commission. These rollups have involved over 1,900 separate limited partnerships
with an estimated aggregate value well over seven billion dollars.

1. Rollup structure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A typical ``rollup'' will combine several non-traded individual limited partnerships into a single new entity that
publicly trades on a national securities exchange or on Nasdaq/NM. This entity generally is an infinite life vehicle
which is designed continually to reinvest proceeds from asset sales, unlike the provisions limited partnerships,
which are investments with a limited or finite term that, at some point in time, distribute proceeds, if any, to investors.
A rollup also can involve the reorganization of a single partnership into a new entity.

2. Benefits of rollups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some cases, reorganizing non-traded public limited partnerships that have lost substantial value and creating
a new publicly-traded, infinite life vehicle can enhance the value of the investments of the limited partners.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 For example, the new entity may offer investors liquidity previously unavailable, create economies of scale and
reduce administrative costs to improve performance, and create broader diversification of assets which will improve
investment safety.

3. Criticism of rollup 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Critics have said that the vast majority of limited partnership rollups result in the newly-traded security immediately
falling to a discount to its net asset value, as cash flow from the stronger partnerships is used to support losses from
the weaker partnerships.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 They further argue that ongoing asset management fees and expenses assessed by the general partners offset, and in
fact may exceed, the promised reduced administrative costs.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, the limited partners' equity is substantially diluted. One industry witness testified before Congress
that, in the large rollup transactions, limited partners have realized, on average, a drop of 45 percent from the exchange
value on the first day of trading in their newly issued rollup securities.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Congressional testimony also disclosed estimates that these limited partners when taken as a whole have lost approximately
$2 billion in equity, while rollup sponsors have earned over $250 million in fees.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 By one estimate, when compared to original exchange values, investors involved in public limited partnership rollups
have experience a decline of approximately 70 percent in limited partner equity.

While investor complaints have been sparked by the enormous declines in the value of the rollup security compared
with the ``exchange value'' stated in the prospectus, rollup sponsors have argued that the stated exchange value
is not intended to be the trading price of the security, and thus, such comparisons tend to overstate the magnitude
of investor losses.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 However, rollup disclosure documents generally have proven to be almost incomprehensible and it is likely that sponors
did not clearly disclose to investors that the stated exchange value is not intended to be the trading price of the security.

Congressinonal testimony revealed at least three other forms of abuses in connection with rollup transactions.
First, financially sound partnerships are merged with partnerships that are experiencing financial difficulty,
thereby diluting the interest of the limited partners of the sound partnerships.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 Second, some general partners have modified the original partnership's fee structure in order to give much larger
equity interests or fees to themselves, to the detriment of the limited partners.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, when the unattractive terms of the new rolled up security become apparent, the market further discounts
the newly traded security, pushing its price even lower.

The seriousness of the problem with rollup disclosure documents was underscored by Commission Chairman Richard
Breeden when he stated in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in the Spring of 1991 that, ``I have taken a
look at some of the documents filed with us in these roll-up transactions and I would like to meet the person who can understand
all of the disclosures in some of those documents.'' The Committee notes that a disclosure document which the Chairman
of the Securities and Exchange Commission has difficulty understanding is likely to prove daunting in complexity
to the average small investor in a limited partnership.

As noted above, Section 3(a) of the Rollup Reform Act amended Section 15A(b) of the Exchange Act to require that the
NASD rules that promote just and equitable principles of trade include rules to prevent NASD members from participating
in any limited partnership rollup transaction that does not provide procedures to protect certain specified rights
of limited partners. Such rights include:

(i) an appraisal and compensation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) retention of a security under substantially the same terms and conditions of the original issue;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) approval of the limited partnership rollup transaction by at least 75 percent of the outstanding interests
of each participating limited partnership; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) other rights designed to protect dissenting limited partners;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The right not to have their voting power unfairly reduced or abridged;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The right not to bear an unfair portion of the costs of a proposed rollup transaction that is rejected; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Restrictions on the general partner's conversion of contingent interests or fees into non-contingent interests
or fees and restrictions on the general partner's receipt of a non-contingent equity interest in exchange for fees
for services which have not yet been provided.

The Rollup Reform Act defines a ``dissenting limited partner'' as a person who, on the date on which rollup soliciting
material is mailed to investors, holds a beneficial interest in a limited partnership that is the subject of a limited
partnership rullup transaction and who votes against the transaction and complies with procedures established
by the NASD to perfect dissenter's rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3(c) of the Rollup Reform Act amended Section 15A(b) of the Exchange Act to require that the rules of a registered
securities association prohibit the authorization for quotation on an automated interdealer quotation system
sponsored by that association of any security designated by the Commission as a national market system security resulting
from a rollup transaction, unless such transaction provides certain rights for limited partners. The rights set
forth under this section are identical to those set forth in Section 3(a) for registered securities associations.

III. Description of Proposed Rule Change and Comments Received
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The NASD's proposed rule change would prevent its members from participating in any ``limited partnership rollup
transaction'' as that term is defined in the Rollup Reform Act if the transaction does not provide those procedures
to protect the rights of limited partners that are mandated by the Rollup Reform Act. The proposed rule change also
would narrow the scope of transactions in which members are forbidden to receive differential compensation. Finally,
the proposed rule change would prohibit the authorization for quotation on Nasdaq of any security designated by the
Commission as a national market system security resulting from a rollup transaction, unless the transaction provides
certain rights for dissenting limited partners.

Exclusions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' also incorporates six exclusions, in accordance
with the Rollup Reform Act. A transaction will not be deemed to be a limited partnership rollup transaction of it: (1)
involves only a limited partnership or partnerships having an operating policy or practice of retaining cash available
for distribution and reinvesting proceeds from the sale, financing, or refinancing of assets in accordance with
such criteria as the Commission determines appropriate; (2) involves only limited partnerships wherein the interests
of the limited partners are repurchased, recalled, or exchanged in accordance with the terms of the preexisting limited
partnership agreements for securities in an operating company specifically identified at the time of the formation
of the original limited partnership; (3) involves only securities to be issued or exchanged that are not required
to be and are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''); (4) involves only issuers that
are not required to register or report under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, both before and after the transaction;
(5) involves the combination or reorganization of one or more limited partnerships in which a non-affiliated party
succeeds to the interests of a general partner or sponsor, except those types of transactions as the Commission may
by rule deem to fall within the definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction,'' if: (a) such action is approved
by not less than 662/3 percent of the outstanding units of each of the participating limited partnerships; and (b)
as a result of the transaction, the existing general partners will receive only compensation to which they are entitled
as expressly provided for in the preexisting limited partnership agreements; or (6) involves a transaction, except
as the Commission may by rule deem to fall within the definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction,'' in
which the securities offered to investors are securities of another entity that are reported under a transaction
reporting plan declared effective by the Commission under Section 11A of the Exchange Act before the date of enactment
of the Rollup Reform Act, if: (a) such other entity was formed, and such class of securities was reported and regularly
traded, not less than 12 months before the date on which soliciting material is mailed to investors; and (b) the securities
of that entity issued to investors in the transaction do not exceed 20 percent of the total outstanding securities
of the entity, exclusive of any securities of such class held by or for the account of the entity or a subsidiary of the
entity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is soliciting comment on the Differential Compensation Amendment. As noted above, the Differential
Compensation Amendment would amend Subsection (b)(6) to: (i) limit the scope of the prohibition upon receipt of differential
compensation to transactions constituting ``limited partnership rollup transactions'' instead of transactions
constituting ``rollups of direct participation programs'';
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and (ii) prohibit the participation of members and persons associated with members in a limited partnership rollup
transaction unless the transaction includes provisions designed to protect the rights of limited partners.

Subsection (b)(6)(C) thus would regulate a member's solicitation activities, advisory activities, or the writing
of a fairness opinion. Subsections (b)(6)(A) and (B) currently regulate only a member's receipt of differential
compensation in the solicitation of votes or tenders.

Receipt of Differential Compensation in DPP Rollups Not Also Constituting Limited Partnership Rollup Transactions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Congress began to focus on investor protection, fairness and disclosure issues related to rollup transactions in
1990. One of the early abuses on which Congress focussed was payment of compensation to soliciting broker-dealer
only when an investor voted in favor of a rollup transaction. The Rollup Reform Act requires the NASD to adopt rules
proscribing the receipt by members of ``differential compensation'' when soliciting votes for a limited partnership
rollup transaction. The Commission previously had approved an NASD rule regulating its members' receipt of differential
compensation in DPP rollups.

Current Subsections (b)(6) (A) and (B) were adopted in that rule change to regulate the participation of members in
the solicitation of votes or tenders from participants in a rollup of a DPP. The NASD stated in Amendment No. 7 that at
the time of its adoption, the SEC and NASD were aware that the definition of ``rollup of a direct participation program''
was broader than the definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' then pending in Congress (and proposed
to be amended in this proposed rule change) because it applies to ``direct participation programs'' rather than ``limited
partnerships'' and does not include all of the exclusions that are available from the ``limited partnership rollup''
definition.

But see H.R. Rep. No. 254, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 95 (1991), which proposed to define ``partnership'' to include ``such

The NASD continues to be concerned that it may be confusing to have two definitions of a rollup transaction which are
different in scope set forth in Subsection 34(b).
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the NASD is proposing to amend Subsections (b)(6) (A) and (B) by replacing the special rollup definition
in those Subsections with the new definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' and by substituting
the term ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' wherever the term ``rollup of a direct participation program''
currently appears. The NASD notes that the result of this amendment would be to limit the scope of these Subsections
as they would not longer be applicable to almost any DPP rollup, but only to ``limited partnership rollup transactions''
as defined in the proposed rule change.

In September 1991, in Notice to Members 91&hyph;56, the NASD adopted rules which restrict differential compensation
in connection with the ``rollup of a direct participation program.'' The term ``rollup of a direct participation
program'' is a broader concept than ``limited partnership rollup transactions'' and accordingly the limitations
in the receipt of compensation and the allocation of expenses which is addressed in this earlier release will apply
even if the transaction is not considered a ``limited partnership rollup transaction.''

2. When a Limited Partnership Rollup Transaction is Presumed Not to be Unfair or Unreasonable. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i), the NASD proposes to define a series of circumstances with respect to limited
partnership rollup transactions which are presumed not to be unfair or unreasonable. In accordance with the Rollup
Reform Act, it is presumed not to be unfair or unreasonable if dissenting limited partners are offered one of the following:
an appraisal and compensation, retention of a security with substantially the same terms and conditions as the original
limited partnership, approval of the rollup transaction by not less than 75 percent of the outstanding units of each
participating limited partnership, or other comparable rights designed to protect dissenting limited partners.
Protections for limited partners also include the right of limited partners not to have their voting power unfairly
reduced, the right of limited partners not to bear unfair costs associated with a rollup transaction that is rejected,
and certain restrictions on abusive changes in management fees and compensation. As noted above, dissenters' rights
may be asserted only by a person who, on the date that rollup soliciting material is mailed to investors, is a holder
of a beneficial interest in the limited partnership that is the subject of the rollup. The proposed rule change would
require a transaction constituting a ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' to include one of the provisions
set forth in Subsections (b)(6)(C)(i) a., b., or c., discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Compensation Based on Appraisal: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)a. provides that dissenting limited partners must receive compensation based on an
appraisal made by an independent appraiser, unaffiliated with the sponsor or general partner of the program. The
appraisal provided should consist of an accurate measure of the present financial value of the dissenting investor's
ownership interest in the underlying assets of the limited partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forms of compensation based on appraisal may include cash, secured or unsecured debt instruments, or freely-tradable
securities. Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i) imposes several conditions upon the issuance of debt instruments to ensure
that the debt issued is equivalent in value to the cash payment and, if readily marketable, would likely trade in an
aftermarket at such value.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 This is intended to prevent dissenting investors from being forced to accept debt instruments which, reflecting
their below-market value, would immediately trade at a substantial discount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
39
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
All debt instruments must provide for a trustee and an indenture, and provide for prepayment with 80% of the net proceeds
of any sale or refinancing of the assets of the entity. All debt instruments must provide the holders with a market rate
of interest equal to at least 120% of the applicable federal rate and have a term not longer than 8 years. Unsecured debt
instruments may be used only when the entity issuing the debt has a limitation on total leverage not greater than 70%
of the appraised value of its assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Freely-tradable securities may be utilized as compensation only if issued by a company which has been listed on a national
securities exchange or traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market prior to the transaction. The number of freely-tradable
securities offered in return for partnership interests would be determined in relation to the average last sale price
of the securities in the 20-day period following the date of the meeting at which the vote on the rollup occurs.
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 If the issuer of the freely-tradable securities and the sponsor or general partner are affiliated (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 if it receives any material compensation from the issuer or its affiliates in conjunction with the rollup transaction
or the purchase of the general partner's interest), and the securities issued as compensation are new securities,
such securities must not represent more than 20% of the issued and outstanding securities of that class after issuance.
The 20% limitation on the amount of securities offered as compensation by an affiliate helps to establish a threshold
below which significant dilution could be presumed not to have not occurred.

In response to a comment by the ABA, the NASD clarified that the ``freely-tradable securities'' referred to in Subsection
(b)(6)(C)(i)a.4. would be valued at a 20-day period ``following the date of the meeting at which the vote on the limited
partnership rollup occurs. The `vote' referred to may be a vote, consent, or authorization.'' See Amendment No. 5.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Receipt of a Security With Substantially the Same Terms and Conditions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)b. provides that dissenting limited partners may receive or retain a security with substantially
the same terms and conditions as the original issue if certain conditions are met. Retention of a security under the
same terms and conditions as the original issue means the provision of a security that has the same characteristics
as the dissenting limited partners' original limited partnership interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Comparable Rights: Supermajority Approval, Review by Independent Committee, and Other Comparable Rights: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)c. permits members and persons associated with members to participate in a limited partnership
rollup transaction as long as the transaction includes ``other comparable rights'' provisions designed to protect
the rights of limited partners. This Subsection is intended to provide flexibility for sponsors and general partners
in structuring rollups, while at the same time providing protections for limited partners. ``Comparable rights''
may include the right to supermajority approval of the transaction, the right to review of the transaction by an independent
committee, or such other rights as the NASD deems comparable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(i) Supermajority Approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 General partners will not be required to provide the right of compensation, as provided in new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)
where at least 75% of the outstanding units of each of the individual limited partnerships participating approve
the rollup transaction. Any limited partnership that fails to reach the 75% threshold must be excluded from the rollup
transaction. The proposed rule change, however, would permit a limited partnership rollup transaction to be consummated
even though individual partnerships did not approve the transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(ii) Review by Independent Committee.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule change relating to review by an independent committee will require that the committee: (1) Be approved
by a majority of the outstanding securities of each participating limited partnership; (2) have access to the books
and records of the partnership; (3) prepare a report to the limited partners that are the subject of the rollup presenting
its findings and recommendations, including any minority views; (4) have the authority to negotiate the proposed
transaction with the general partner or sponsor on behalf of the limited partners, but not the authority to approve
the transaction; (5) deliberate for a period no longer than 60 days unless unanimously agreed upon by the members of
the independent committee or if approved by the NASD; (6) may be compensated and reimbursed by the partnerships subject
to the limited partnership rollup transaction and have the ability to retain independent counsel and financial advisors
to represent all limited partners at the limited partnerships' expense; and (7) be entitled to indemnification to
the maximum extent permitted by law from the general partners, sponsors, limited partnerships, and rolled-up entities
against claims, causes of action or lawsuits initiated by any party in interest, including limited partnerships
or limited partners, related to any action or decision made in furtherance of their responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(iii) Other Comparable Rights.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comparable rights for dissenting limited partners are not limited to supermajority approval or the establishment
of an independent committee, but may include any other comparable right proposed by general partners or sponsors,
provided that the general partners or sponsors demonstrate to the satisfaction of the NASD, or if the NASD determines
appropriate, to the satisfaction of an independent committee, that the rights proposed are comparable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regardless of compliance with Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i), a limited partnership rollup transaction will be presumed
to be unfair or unreasonable, pursuant to new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 if: (1) Certain actions taken by the general partner result in the unfair conversion and valuation of general partner
interests in a limited partnership rollup transaction; (2) a limited partnership rollup transaction fails to protect
the voting rights of the limited partners; (3) the transaction costs of a rejected limited partnership rollup transaction
are unfairly apportioned or allocated; or (4) the payment of fees to general partners in connection with limited partnership
rollup transactions are unfair, unreasonable, or inappropriate.

Where a limited partnership rollup transaction is determined by NASD staff to include one of the arrangements considered
to be unfair or unreasonable, the member bears the burden of rebutting the presumption by demonstrating that the arrangement
is not unfair or unreasonable or that the arrangement does not come within one of the enumerated unfair and unreasonable
arrangement provisions.

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)a. provides that it presumptively unfair and unreasonable for general partners, when
determining their interest in the new entity resulting from a limited partnership rollup transaction, to: (1) convert
an equity interest for which consideration has not been paid into a voting interest in the new entity if the equity interest
was not otherwise provided for in the limited partnership agreement and disclosed to limited partners; (2) fail to
follow the valuation methods, if any, in the partnership agreements when valuing their partnership interests;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
43
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or (3) utilize a projected value of their equity interest rather than the appraised current value of their equity interest
when determining their interest in the new entity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b. contains four provisions for the protection of investors with respect to voting rights.
New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b.1. provides that it is presumptively unfair if the voting rights in the entity resulting
from the limited partnerships rollup transaction do not follow the original voting rights of the limited partnerships
participating in the transaction. However, the NASD recognizes that certain material changes to voting rights may
be necessary to conform disparate rights that may exist among participating partnerships. Material changes may
be effected only if the NASD determines that the changes are not unfair or if an independent committee approves such
changes.

 of the interests in an entity resulting from a limited partnership rollup transaction is unable to vote to cause the
entity to take certain actions which are ordinarily the prerogative of the owners rather than management. Thus, it
is presumptively unfair not to permit a vote to amend the limited partnership agreement, articles of incorporation,
bylaws, or indenture. It is also presumptively unfair not to permit a vote to dissolve the entity. It is also presumptively
unfair not to permit a vote to remove and elect the general partners, board of directors, trustee, or similar governing
entity. Finally, it is presumptively unfair not to permit a vote to approve or disapprove the sale of substantially
all the assets of the entity, without concurrence by the sponsor, general partner(s), board of directors, trustee,
or similar governing entity, unless such actions would be inconsistent with state law.

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b.3. provides that it is presumptively unfair if the sponsor or general partner proposing
a limited partnership rollup transaction is not required to provide a document which clearly delineates instructions
and procedures of voting against or dissenting from a proposed transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b.4. provides that it is presumptively unfair if the general partner or sponsor fails
to utilize an independent third party to receive and tabulate all votes and dissents or fails to require the third party
to make the tabulation available to the general partner and any limited partner upon request at any time during and
after voting occurs.

c. Transaction Costs: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)c. provides that it is presumptively unfair if transaction costs of a rejected limited partnership
rollup transaction are not apportioned between the general and limited partners in accordance with the final vote
as follows: (1) in the case of a limited partnership rollup transaction which is not approved, the general partner
or sponsor bears transaction costs in proportion to the total number of abstentions and votes to reject the transaction,
and the limited partners bear transaction costs in proportion to the number of votes to approve the transaction; or
(2) in the case of a rollup transaction which is approved, but where some individual partnerships do not approve and
are not included in the approved transaction, the general partner is required to pay costs on behalf of the limited
partnerships who have voted not to approve the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to allocating total costs for a rejected limited partnership rollup transaction, the NASD believes
that subsections (b)(6(B) and (b)(6(C)(ii)d. taken together require the general partner to pay all the solicitation
expenses in addition to transaction costs in proportion to the total number of abstentions and votes to reject the
transaction. Additionally, limited partnerships which vote to reject and which are not included in a limited partnership
rollup transaction which is ultimately consummated, may not be assessed any transaction costs.

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)d. protects limited partners against the assessment of fees by a general partner which
are unfair, unreasonable, or inappropriate. New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)d.1. provides that it is presumptively
unfair for general partners to receive or convert unearned management fees discounted to a present value while also
proposing to receive new asset-based fees. A similar presumption of unfairness applies if property management fees
and other fees are inappropriate, unreasonable, greater than or not competitive with the fees that would be paid to
third parties for performing similar services under proposed Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)d.2. Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)d.3.
provides that substantial and adverse changes in fees are presumed unreasonable if not submitted to and approved
by an independent committee.

The NASD is proposing to amend Part I and III to Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws to establish listing standards for Nasdaq/NM
securities resulting from a limited partnership rollup transaction, as required by new Section 15A(b)(13) of the
Exchange Act. The rule language is the same as that proposed for inclusion in Subsection (b) of Article III, Section
34 of the Rules of Fair Practice with two minor exceptions. When the term ``direct participation program'' is used
in the definition section, a cross-reference is provided to the definition of that term in Article III, Section 34
of the Rules of Fair Practice. In addition, the term ``management fee'' is modified to refer only to such fees related
to a ``limited partnership.'' In comparison, the definition in Article III, Section 34(b) of the Rules of Fair Practice
substituted the term ``direct participation program'' because the term ``management fee'' is used elsewhere in
Article III, Section 34(b) of the Rules of Fair Practice and the definition, therefore, should be applicable to any
DPP.

The new listing criteria for limited partnership rollups are included in new Section 3 to Part III of Schedule D. Current
Sections 3 through 7 are redesignated to reflect the addition of new Section 3 and are amended to reference the limited
partnership rollup criteria. Proposed Section 8 is amended to permit the NASD to terminate an issue's designation
if it no longer complies with the requirements in redesignated Sections 5 and 6 or 7.

Application of Proposed Rule Change to UPREITs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
UPREIT transactions have certain general characteristics. A limited partnership or partnerships are consolidated
into an operating limited partnership. The consolidation is generally conducted as a private placement. In order
to effect a non-taxable exchange, the individual limited partnership interests or the properties are exchanged
for the operating limited partnership units.
<FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>
 The general partner of the operating limited partnership, a real estate investment trust (``REIT''), issues beneficial
interests to investors in exchange for cash to raise capital that will purchase some of the operating partnership
units. The operating partnership, in turn, may use the proceeds to pay the debts of the limited partnerships included
in the operating partnership. It may use the proceeds for other purposes, such as buying additional properties. The
REIT shares may be listed on a national securities exchange or Nasdaq/NM and, thus, reported under a transaction reporting
plan. As part of the transaction, the unitholders of the new operating partnership are generally given an open-ended
option after one year to redeem their operating partnership units for cash from the REIT. Instead of offering cash,
the typical REIT may, at its option, offer unitholders REIT units for the operating partnership units pursuant to
a private exchange offering or a registered exchange offering, depending on how the offering is structured. It is,
however, optional to the operating partnership unitholders as to whether to exercise the redemption right.

Built-in gain is deferred, not eliminated. Also, the exchange of old partnership interests for operating partnership
units is not necessarily tax-free under all circumstances. After the proceeds of the public REIT offering are used
to pay down debt, if a partner's share of liabilities of the operating partnership is less than the same partner's share
of liabilities of the old partnership, the partner will be treated as having received a cash distribution. If the distribution
exceeds the adjusted basis in the partner's operating units, the partner will recognize taxable gain. If the old partnerships
partly sell and partly contribute property to the operating partnership, partners in the operating partnership
may realize phantom income.

A. UPREIT Structures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
UPREIT transactions have varying structures. The NASD is currently aware of at least three structures. First, UPREITs
can be structured so that both the consolidation of limited partnership interests into the operating partnership
and the issuance of REIT shares to investors are effected pursuant to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
private placement exemptions under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act (``private placement exemption''), after
which the operating partnership units may be redeemed for cash or, at the REIT's option, exchanged for REIT shares
in a private exchange offering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second structure involves the consolidation of limited partners' interests into the operating limited partnership
in a registered transaction, with a simultaneous public offering of REIT units. The REIT shares are listed on a national
securities exchange or authorized for quotation on Nasdaq/NM and are reported under a transaction reporting plan.
The offer by the REIT to the limited partners in the operating partnership to exchange their operating partnership
units for REIT shares is effected as a registered exchange offer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third structure involves the consolidation of limited partners' interests into the operating limited partnership
pursuant to a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
private placement exemption, along with a public offering of units by the REIT general partner. The REIT is listed
on a national securities exchange or Nasdaq/NM. The REIT is thus a reporting company prior to any exchange offer of
REIT shares for operating partnership units. The offer by the REIT to the limited partners in the operating partnership
to exchange their operating partnership units for REIT shares is effected as a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
private placement with the shares then registered by the REIT for the benefit of new holders through a shelf-registration
statement or as a registered exchange offer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Applicability of the Proposed Rule Change to UPREIT Transactions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of an understanding reached between the staffs of the NASD and the SEC, the NASD's Corporate Financing Department
intends to work closely with the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance to review all direct, indirect and multi-step
limited partnership rollup transactions in their entirety, including UPREIT transactions, for an initial determination
of whether a transaction constitutes a ``limited partnership rollup transaction.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the first type of UPREIT transaction described above 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
is not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 subject to the proposed rule change where the claim of a private placement exemption for the exchange offer is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Such a transaction does not meet the definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' because the original
limited partners are receiving securities in the operating partnership that are not required to be registered under
the Securities Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the second type of UPREIT transaction described above 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
subject to the coverage of the proposed rule change because the transaction viewed in its entirety meets the definition
of ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' and does not qualify for any of the exemptions from the definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the third type of UPREIT transaction described above, the NASD will conduct its review of applicability
of the proposed rule change in conjunction with the SEC's review for an initial determination of whether the entire
transaction should be reviewed as a roll-up because it is a step transaction that indirectly involves a roll-up.
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 In the case of a valid private placement of operating partnership units followed by a registered exchange of units
for REIT shares in a short period of time, the two transactions may be stepped together and therefore subject to full
review under the proposed rule change. Another situation where the proposed rule change might be applicable to the
third type of UPREIT transaction is if the claim of a private placement for the consolidation into the operating partnership
is not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and the operating partnership transaction is required to be registered with the Commission and conducted as a public
offering at the same time that the public REIT offering occurs. In this instance also, the NASD would review the transaction
for compliance with the terms of the proposed rule change.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission received seven comment letters. The comment letters from the IPA, DeMott, and the ABA expressed support
for the proposed rule change. One comment letter, from Kelley, stated that the NASD rules should not be adopted ``in
the absence of a legislative mandate.'' The comment letters from Baker &amp; Botts, Kutak Rock, and Hogan &amp; Hartson
neither supported nor opposed the proposed rules but offered suggestions on how to enhance the NASD's rule.

Reform Act rendered moot many of the issues raised by commenters. The significant issues that were raised and not subsequently
mooted by the Rollup Reform Act are addressed below. In addition, the NASD also made several technical amendments
in response to the comment letters.

A. Right of Compensation Based on Appraisals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kelly noted that some partnerships, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 oil and gas, already include requirements for a supporting appraisal underlying the exchange value determination.
Therefore, according to Kelley, the NASD's requirement that dissenters' rights of compensation be based on appraisal,
would give the dissenters the right to a second appraisal which would be ``redundant and wasteful.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD has stated that ``an appraisal that functions to determine the transaction's exchange value could also be
used to determine the value of dissenters's compensation so long as the appraisal is done in a manner consistent with
the appropriate industry practice.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hogan &amp; Hartson argues that the appraisal rights provisions under new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i) should be clarified
to permit one partnership participating in a rollup to offer one type of right while another partnership may offer
another type of right, stating that such an option would be satisfactory from a fairness perspective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i) does not by its terms prohibit structuring a rollup offering such that different rights
may be offered to different partnerships involved in the same transaction. Further, the ``other comparable rights''
provision in Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)c.3. allows for variations in structuring that, subject to NASD approval,
are indeed comparable to rights provided in the proposed rule change, including variations in form as well as substance.

Two commentators
<FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>
 expressed concern about the use of ``freely-tradable securities'' as compensation for dissenting limited partners,
pursuant to new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)a.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of a ``freely-tradable security'' as compensation is reasonable. The listing standards of the exchanges
and of Nasdaq should provide adequate protection against dilution when ``freely-tradable securities'' are offered
as compensation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One the issue of valuation of the ``freely-tradable securities,'' the ABA voiced concern about the method that the
NASD will use to calculate the value of the securities that will be used as compensation. New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)
provides that the value of the freely-tradable security must be determined in relation to the last sale price ``in
the 20-day period following the effective date.'' The ABA noted that the ``effective date'' must refer to the effective
date of the registration statement rather than to the closing of the rollup occurs.''

C. Valuation Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)a.2. provides that a rollup is presumed to be unfair if the general partner fails to follow
the valuation provision in the limited partnership agreement. The ABA pointed out that partnership agreements do
not contain such valuation provisions, and suggested revised language to accommodate such a contingency and permit
reliance on ``more favorable'' valuation provisions than those in limited partnership agreements ``if any.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD stated that it does not want to make determinations as to whether a proposed valuation method is more favorable
than those contained in limited partnership agreements to which investors have previously agreed. However, the
NASD amended its rule to clarify that Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)b.1. applies to rollups which contain valuation provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hogan &amp; Hartson argues that the valuation requirements in new Subsections (b)(6)(C)(ii)a.2. and 3. should be
clarified by explanations of how valuation provisions of limited partnership agreements and utilization of current
value methodology can be both followed in the event of inconsistency, and requests that the NASD explain the meaning
of the terms ``current value'' and ``future value'' in new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)a.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the use of a ``current value'' for evaluating equity interests of the roll-up partnerships
when determining the general partner's/sponsor's interest in the new entity is fair because the guesswork involved
in arriving at any ``future value'' estimate may prejudice the limited partners in favor of the general partners,
especially if the estimated value is exaggerated. However, the NASD also believes that the valuation of partnership
interests should be appropriate to the particular industry, and that is permissible, for example, to interpret ``current
value'' on a ``going concern'' or ``liquidation'' basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)a.2., the NASD generally believes that the fairest valuation method of all
is that method which reflects, as much as possible, the original agreement or contract between the general partner/sponsor
and limited partners. However, the NASD believes that if the valuation provisions of the existing partnership agreements
require a future valuation of general partner interests which would be inconsistent with the proposed rule change's
requirement that current value be used, then the requirement to use current value supersedes the requirement to follow
valuation models in the original partnership agreements.

<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 The NASD amended its rule to make it clear that it would not conflict with or supersede state corporate law. In response

Hogan &amp; Hartson argued that the Rollup Reform Act did not mandate that the NASD impose specific voting rights,
especially for the operating partnership in UPREITs, because very few partnership agreements provide for such rights
in any case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the proposed rule change does not impose specific voting rights. First, as noted above,
the rule is drafted in a manner that defers to applicable state law. Second, if the NASD staff determines that a particular
voting arrangement is presumptively unfair or unreasonable, the member may nonetheless rebut the presumption if
it demonstrates that the arrangement is not unfair or unreasonable or that the arrangement does not come within one
of the enumerated unfair and unreasonable arrangement provisions.

New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)c. requires that transaction costs be apportioned according to voting so that, in a

the cost of a rejected rollup transaction in proportion to abstentions.

to bear ``all'' costs of a rollup transaction that is not approved, but only those costs in proportion to the total number
of abstentions and votes to reject the transaction; limited partners bear costs in proportion to the number or votes
to approve the transaction.

The Commission disagrees. In proposing Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)c., the NASD stated that it intended to ``encourage
general partners to structure a fair transaction that will be approved by limited partners.'' By placing the transaction
costs of a rejected rollup on the general partner or the sponsor, the NASD is imposing the appropriate burden on the
general partner or sponsor to structure a rollup in a manner intended to secure as many favorable votes as possible.

New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)d. sets forth criteria to use in determining whether fees paid to the general partner
in a rollup are presumptively unfair. Subsection (b)(6)(C)(iv)3. provides that changes in fees which are substantial
and adverse to limited partners are presumed unreasonable if not submitted to or approved by an independent party.
In order to simplify compliance with the terms of Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)(4)(C), the IPA suggested that the NASD,
in addition to an independent committee, be permitted to approve changes in fees which are substantial and adverse
to limited partners.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hogan &amp; Hartson argues that UPREIT transactions do not trigger the application of the proposed rule change because
such transactions either do not come under the definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction,'' or, conceding
the application of the definition, meet the requirements of one or more transactional exemptions from the definition.
Hogan &amp; Hartson concludes that the only part of the entire UPREIT transaction under consideration is the potential
redemption/exchange of operating units for cash or REIT shares, not the initial consolidation of individual partnership
interests into operating partnership units, nor the initial consolidation in conjunction with the redemption/exchange.
Hogan &amp; Hartson argues that the initial consolidation of limited partnership interests into an operating partnership
that does not have its shares traded on an exchange or authorized for quotation on Nasdaq/NM does not come within the
definition of a limited partnership rollup transaction and, thus, falls outside the purview of the proposed rule
change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission disagrees. UPREIT transactions should not be viewed in discrete stages, as if each stage in the transaction
were isolated from any other stage, with no contemplated interrelationship between the partners, promoters, investors
and financing plans of the partnership consolidation stage and the partners, promoters, investors and financing
plans of the exchange offering stage.

V. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds good cause for partially approving Amendments 5&hyph;8 on an accelerated basis.
<FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>
 As indicated above, the Commission recognizes that the rule change will provide important benefits to investors
who may be subject to limited partnership rollup transactions in that the amended proposed rule change will ensure
that investors' rights are protected in accordance with the intent of Congress as embodied in the Rollup Reform Act.
In addition, the Commission finds that notice in advance of approval of those Amendments intended to conform the proposed
rule change with the Rollup Reform Act is unnecessary because the Rollup Reform Act itself has given interested parties
constructive notice of pertinent terms of the Amendments. The Commission also finds that, except as noted above,
those amendments to the proposed rule change not intended to conform the proposed rule change with the Rollup Reform
Act are intended merely to clarify the rule change. The NASD will implement the rule change on November 1, 1994. The
Commission believes that accelerated approval will avoid unnecessary delay in requiring members to ensure that
they participate in limited partnership rollup transactions only if those transactions provide for fair treatment
of limited partnership investors, protect the rights of all limited partners, including dissenting limited partners,
and do not contain unfair or unreasonable terms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that, with the exception of the Differential Compensation Amendment, the proposed rule change
is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6)
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 of the Exchange Act, which require, in pertinent part, that the rules of a registered securities association be designed
to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, promote just and equitable principles of trade, and protect investors
and the public interest; the provisions of Section 15A(b)(12)
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 of the Exchange Act, which require the rules of a registered securities association to promote just and equitable
principles of trade include rules to prevent members of the association from participating in any limited partnership
rollup transaction that does not provide procedures to protect certain specified rights of limited partners; and
the provisions of Section 15A(b)(13)
<FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>
 of the Exchange Act, which require that the rules of a registered securities association prohibit the authorization
for quotation on an automated interdealer quotation system sponsored by the association any security designated
by the SEC as a national market system security resulting from a limited partnership rollup transaction, unless such
transaction provides certain rights for limited partners. The proposed rule change will restrict member participation
in unfair rollup transactions and prohibit inclusion in Nasdaq/NM of any securities resulting from an unfair rollup
transaction.

The Rollup Reform Act reflects a brief that partnership rollup transactions, when properly structured, may offer
significant benefits to investors and for businesses that have used these structures to raise capital. However,
Congress has determined that abusive limited partnership rollup transactions harm investors, undermine investor
confidence and threaten capital formation.
<FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rule change will permit rollups to take place but will curtail the abusive practices that have occurred
in the past. The proposed rule change is designed to ensure the fairness of partnership rollup to the limited partners
by giving dissenters the right to compensation, based on appraisal, rather than being forced into a rollup. In addition
the proposed rule change contains provisions which prevent the unfair conversion and valuation of the general partner's
interests in a rollup transaction, prevent investors' voting rights from being unfairly reduced or abridged, prevent
the limited partners from having to bear an unfair portion of the cost of a transaction that has been rejected, and prevent
the payment of fees to general partners in connection with a rollup that are unfair, unreasonable, or inappropriate.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the State Justice Institute Act of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 10701, et seq., as amended, the Institute is authorized
to award grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to State and local courts, nonprofit organizations, and
others for the purpose of improving the administration of justice in the State courts of the United States. Approximately
$111/2 million is available for award in FY 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Types of Grants Available and Funding Schedules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SJI grant program is designed to be responsive to the most pressing needs of the State courts. The Institute accordingly
offers six different types of grants, each of which responds to an important need of the State judiciaries. The types
of grants available in FY 1995 and the funding cycles for each program are provided below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Project Grants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These grants are awarded to support education, research, demonstration and technical assistance projects to improve
the administration of justice in the State courts. With limited exceptions (see sections II.B.2.b.i. and II.C.),
project grants are intended to support innovative projects of national significance. As provided in chapter V. of
the Guideline, project grants, with limited exceptions, may not exceed $200,000 a year. Applicants must ordinarily
submit a concept paper (see chapter VI.) and an application (see chapter VII.) in order to obtain a project grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in section VI.C., the Board may make an ``accelerated'' project grant of less than $40,000 on the basis
of the concept paper alone when the need for the project is clear and little additional information would be provided
in an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FY 1995 mailing deadline for project grant concept papers is November 23, 1994. Papers must be postmarked or bear
other evidence of submission by that date. With two exceptions noted immediately below, the FY 1995 funding cycle
will be substantially similar to the FY 1994 cycle: the Board will meet in early March, 1995 to invite formal applications
based on the most promising concept papers; applications will be due in May; and awards will be approved by the Board
in July. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first exception to this schedule pertains to proposals to follow up on the National Conference on Mass Tort Litigation
to be in November, 1994. Applicants interested in participating in this special round of funding may submit concept
papers proposing projects addressing the findings and recommendations of that conference by March 10, 1995. The
papers will be considered by the Board at its meeting in April, 1995. Invited applications will be reviewed at the Board's
July, 1995 meeting. See section II.B.2.l. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second exception is for projects to follow up on the National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in
the Courts to be held March 2&hyph;5, 1995. Concept papers for projects to implement the State action plans developed
at the conference must be mailed by October 6, 1995.

Package Grants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This grant program permits applicants to submit one concept paper (or application) for a ``package'' of related grants
rather than separate proposals for each related component of the package. Package grants of up to $750,000 per year
may be awarded to support projects that address interrelated topics or the core elements of a multifaceted program,
or that require the services of all or some of the same key staff persons. Package grants must enhance (not merely maintain)
an applicant's services and must otherwise meet the Institute's grant criteria. The Board retains the discretion
to support all, none, or selected portions of the proposed package. Package grant concept papers and applications
will be considered on the same schedule as project grants. See sections III.J., V.C. and D., VI.A.2.b. and 3.b., VII.A.3.,
VII.C., and VII.D. for more information about package grants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Technical Assistance Grants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this program, a State or local court may receive a grant of up to $30,000 to engage outside experts to provide technical
assistance to diagnose, develop, and implement a response to a jurisdiction's problems. The Guideline allocates
up to $600,000 in FY 1995 funds to support technical assistance grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Curriculum Adaptation Grants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A grant of up to $20,000 may be awarded to a State or local court to replicate or modify a model training program developed
with SJI funds. The Guideline allocates up to $350,000 for these grants in FY 1995, the same amount allocated in FY 1994.
See section II.B.2.b.i.(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like Technical Assistance grant applications, letters requesting Curriculum Adaptation grants may be submitted
at any time during the fiscal year. However, in order to permit the Institute sufficient time to evaluate these proposals,
letters must be submitted no later than 90 days before the projected date of the training program. See section II.B.2.b.i.(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scholarships
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Guideline allocates up to $250,000 of FY 1995 funds for scholarships to enable judges and court managers to attend
out-of-State education and training programs. See section II.B.2.b.v. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Guideline establishes four deadlines for scholarship requests: November 1, 1994 for training programs beginning
between February 1, 1995 and April 30, 1995; February 1, 1995 for programs beginning between May 1, 1995 and July 31,
1995; May 1, 1995 for programs beginning between August 1, 1995 and October 31, 1995; and August 1, 1995 for programs
beginning between November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in past years, the proposed Guideline provides that each scholarship application must be accompanied by a concurrence
signed by the chief justice of the applicant's State. The purpose of this requirement has been to assure that: the applicant's
participation in the program benefits the State; the applicant's absence to attend the program would not present
an undue hardship to the court; and receipt of a scholarship would not diminish the amount of funds made available by
the State for judicial education. Because this requirement has caused some confusion among applicants and there
are variations among States in the manner in which the concurrence request is considered, the Institute is particularly
interested in receiving comments regarding the benefits and drawbacks of continuing the concurrence requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Renewal Grants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are two types of renewal grants available from SJI: Continuation grants (see sections III.H., V.C. and D., and
IX.A.) and on-going support grants (see sections III.I., V.C. and D., and IX.B.). Continuation grants are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to support limited duration projects that involve the same type of activities as the original project. On-going
support grants may be awarded for up to a three-year period to support national-scope projects that provide the State
courts with critically needed services, programs, or products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Guideline establishes a target for renewal grants of no more than $3 million, a little more than 25% of the total
amount available for grants in FY 1995. See section IX. Grantees should accordingly be aware that the award of a grant
to support a project does not constitute a commitment to provide either continuation funding or on-going support.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant for a continuation or on-going support grant must submit a letter notifying the Institute of its intent
to seek such funding, no later than 120 days before the end of the current grant period. The Institute will then notify
the applicant of the deadline for its renewal grant application. See section IX. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Interest Categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Guideline contains 12 Special Interest categories, i.e., those project areas that the Board has identified as
being of particular importance to the State courts. Four new categories have been added this year: ``Children and
Families in Court'' (section II.B.2.e.); ``Resolution of Current Evidentiary Issues'' (section II.B.2.g.); ``Eliminating
Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts'' (section II.B.2.i.); and ``Improving the Courts' Response to Gender-Related
Crimes of Violence'' (section II.B.2.k.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five of FY 1994's Special Interest categories have been eliminated: ``Court Financing;'' ``Delay Reduction'' (although
section II.B.2.b.iv. of the 1995 Guideline solicits applications for a National Symposium on Reducing Litigation
Delay) (see also section II.B.2.d.); ``Intermediate Sanctions;'' ``Improving the Use of Juries'' (jury issues
are now addressed in the ``Enhancing Court-Community Relations'' Special Interest category (section II.B.2.a.);
and ``Family Violence and the Courts'' (although the issues addressed by that category are now addressed by new Special
Interest categories e. and k. noted above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Guideline also solicits proposals to conduct two major national conferences: the National Symposium on Reducing
Litigation Delay noted above and a National Symposium on Sentencing Issues. See section II.B.2.b.iv. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Consultant Rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Institute is strongly committed to assuring that the compensation paid to consultants working under SJI grants
is reasonable in terms of both the total amount paid to an individual consultant, and the amount paid for individual
tasks. A recent internal review of consultant rates found that the number of consultants charging in excess of $300
a day has risen significantly in recent years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board of Directors is concerned about both the level of compensation paid consultants, and the increase in the
number of consultants receiving compensation under SJI-supported projects. Although no changes in the Grant Guideline
are required, the Institute will be undertaking changes in procedure (including Board participation in the review
process and more detailed reports from applicants and grantees) to assure that the compensation paid consultants
is commensurate with the nature and quality of the services to be performed; reasonable, in terms of the tasks performed
and in total; and consistent with the public service mission of the Institute.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Recommendations to Grant Writers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the past seven years, Institute staff have reviewed approximately 2,700 concept papers and 1,300 applications.
On the basis of those reviews, inquiries from applicants, and the views of the Board, the Institute offers the following
recommendations to help potential applicants present workable, understandable proposals that can meet the funding
criteria set forth in this Guideline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute suggests that applicants make certain that they address the questions and issues set forth below when
preparing a concept paper or application. Concept papers and applications should, however, be presented in the formats
specified in sections VI. and VII. of the guideline, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What is the subject or problem you wish to address?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Describe the subject or problem and how it affects the courts and the public. Discuss how your approach will improve
the situation or advance the state of the art or knowledge, and explain why it is the most appropriate approach to take.
When statistics or research findings are cited to support a statement or position, the source of the citation should
be referenced in a footnote or a reference list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What do you want to do? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Explain the goal(s) of the project in simple, straightforward terms. The goals should describe the intended consequences
or expected overall effect of the proposed project (e.g., to enable judges to sentence drug-abusing offenders more
effectively, or to dispose of civil cases within 24 months), rather than the tasks or activities to be conducted (e.g.,
hold three training sessions, or install a new computer system). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the greatest extent possible, an applicant should avoid a specialized vocabulary that is not readily understood
by the general public. Technical jargon does not enhance a paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
How will you do it? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Describe the methodology carefully so that what you propose to do and how you would do it are clear. All proposed tasks
should be set forth so that a reviewer can see a logical progression of tasks and relate those tasks directly to the accomplishment
of the project's goal(s). When in doubt about whether to provide a more detailed explanation or to assume a particular
level of knowledge or expertise on the part of the reviewers, err on the side of caution and provide the additional information.
A description of project tasks also will help identify necessary budget items. All staff positions and project costs
should relate directly to the tasks described. The Institute encourages applicants to attach letters of cooperation
and support from the courts and related agencies that will be involved in or directly affected by the proposed project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
How will you know it works? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Include an evaluation component that will determine whether the proposed training, procedure, service, or technology
accomplished the objectives it was designed to meet. Concept papers and applications should describe the criteria
that will be used to evaluate the project's effectiveness and identify program elements which will require further
modification. The description in the application should include how the evaluation will be conducted, when it will
occur during the project period, who will conduct it, and what specific measures will be used. In most instances, the
evaluation should be conducted by persons not connected with the implementation of the procedure, training, service,
or technique, or the administration of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute has also prepared a more thorough list of recommendations to grant writers regarding the development
of project evaluation plans. Those recommendations are available from the Institute upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
How will others find out about it? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Include a plan to disseminate the results of the training, research, or demonstration beyond the jurisdictions and
individuals directly affected by the project. The plan should identify the specific methods which will be used to
inform the field about the project, such as the publication of law review or journal articles, or the distribution
of key materials. A statement that a report or research findings ``will be made available to'' the field is not sufficient.
The specific means of distribution or dissemination as well as the types of recipients should be identified. Reproduction
and dissemination costs are allowable budget items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What are the specific costs involved? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The budget in both concept papers and applications should be presented clearly. Major budget categories such as personnel,
benefits, travel, supplies, equipment, and indirect costs should be identified separately. The components of ``Other''
or ``Miscellaneous'' items should be specified in the application budget narrative, and should not include set-asides
for undefined contingencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What, if any, match is being offered? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Courts and other units of State and local government (not including publicly-supported institutions of higher education)
are required by the State Justice Institute Act to contribute a match (cash, non-cash, or both) of not less than 50 percent
of the grant funds requested from the Institute. All other applicants also are encouraged to provide a matching contribution
to assist in meeting the costs of a project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The match requirement works as follows: If, for example, the total cost of a project is anticipated to be $150,000,
a State or local court or executive branch agency may request up to $100,000 from the Institute to implement the project.
The remaining $50,000 (50% of the $100,000 requested from SJI) must be provided as match. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cash match includes funds directly contributed to the project by the applicant, or by other public or private sources.
It does not include income generated from tuition fees or the sale of project products. Non-cash match refers to in-kind
contributions by the applicant, or other public or private sources. This includes, for example, the monetary value
of time contributed by existing personnel or members of an advisory committee (but not the time spent by participants
in an educational program attending program sessions). When match is offered, the nature of the match (cash or in-kind)
should be explained and, at the application stage, the tasks and line items for which costs will be covered wholly or
in part by match should be specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Which of the two budget forms should be used?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section VII.A.3. of the SJI Grant Guideline encourages use of the spreadsheet format of Form C1 if the funding request
exceeds $100,000. Form C1 also works well for projects with discrete tasks, regardless of the dollar value of the project.
Form C, the tabular format, is preferred for projects lacking a number of discrete tasks, or for projects requiring
less than $100,000 of Institute funding. Generally, use the form that best lends itself to representing most accurately
the budget estimates for the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
How much detail should be included in the budget narrative?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The budget narrative of an application should provide the basis for computing all project-related costs, as indicated
in section VII.D. of the SJI Grant Guideline. To avoid common shortcomings of application budget narratives, include
the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Personnel estimates that accurately provide the amount of time to be spent by personnel involved with the project
and the total associated costs, including current salaries for the designated personnel (e.g., Project Director,
50% for one year, annual salary of $50,000 = $25,000). If salary costs are computed using an hourly or daily rate, the
annual salary and number of hours or days in a work-year should be shown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Estimates for supplies and expenses supported by a complete description of the supplies to be used, nature
and extent of printing to be done, anticipated telephone charges, and other common expenditures, with the basis for
computing the estimates included (e.g., 100 reports x 75 pages each x .05/page = $375.00). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supply and expense estimates offered simply as ``based on experience'' are not sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to expedite Institute review of the budget, make a final comparison of the amounts listed in the budget narrative
with those listed on the budget form. In the rush to complete all parts of the application on time, there may be many last-minute
changes; unfortunately, when there are discrepancies between the budget narrative and the budget form or the amount
listed on the application cover sheet, it is not possible for the Institute to verify the amount of the request. A final
check of the numbers on the form against those in the narrative will preclude such confusion. The Institute will provide
an illustrative budget and budget form upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What travel regulations apply to the budget estimates?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Transportation costs and per diem rates must comply with the policies of the applicant organization, and a copy of
the applicant's travel policy should be submitted as an appendix to the application. If the applicant does not have
a travel policy established in writing, then travel rates must be consistent with those established by the Institute
or the Federal Government (a copy of the Institute's travel policy is available upon request). The budget narrative
should state which regulations are in force for the project and should include the estimated fare, the number of persons
traveling, the number of trips to be taken, and the length of stay. The estimated costs of travel, lodging, ground transportation,
and other subsistence should be listed separately. When combined, the subtotals for these categories should equal
the estimate listed on the budget form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
May grant funds be used to purchase equipment?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Generally, grant funds may be used to purchase only the equipment that is necessary to demonstrate a new technological
application in a court, or that is otherwise essential to accomplishing the objectives of the project. Equipment
purchases to support basic court operations ordinarily will not be approved. The budget narrative must list the equipment
to be purchased and explain why the equipment is necessary to the success of the project. Written prior approval of
the Institute is required when the amount of computer hardware to be purchased or leased exceeds $10,000, or the software
to be purchased exceeds $3,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
To what extent may indirect costs be included in the budget estimates?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is the policy of the Institute that all costs should be budgeted directly; however, if an applicant has an indirect
cost rate that has been approved by a Federal agency within the last two years, an indirect cost recovery estimate may
be included in the budget. A copy of the approved rate agreement should be submitted as an appendix to the application.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an applicant does not have an approved rate agreement, an indirect cost rate proposal should be prepared in accordance
with Section XI.H.4. of the Grant Guideline, based on the applicant's audited financial statements for the prior
fiscal year. (Applicants lacking an audit must budget all project costs directly.) If an indirect cost rate proposal
is to be submitted, the budget should reflect estimates based on that proposal. Obviously, this requires that the
proposal be completed at the time of application so that the appropriate estimates may be included; however, grantees
have until three months after the project start date to submit the indirect cost proposal to the Institute for approval.
An indirect cost rate worksheet on computer diskette is available from the Institute upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Does the budget truly reflect all costs required to complete the project?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After preparing the program narrative portion of the application, applicants may find it helpful to list all the major
tasks or activities required by the proposed project, including the preparation of products, and note the individual
expenses, including personnel time, related to each. This will help to ensure that, for all tasks described in the
application (e.g., development of a videotape, research site visits, distribution of a final report), the related
costs appear in the budget and are explained correctly in the budget narrative.

Recommendations To Grantees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Institute's staff works with grantees to help assure the smooth operation of the project and compliance with the
SJI Guidelines. On the basis of monitoring more than 800 grants, the Institute staff offers the following suggestions
to aid grantees in meeting the administrative and substantive requirements of their grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
After the grant has been awarded, when are the first quarterly reports due?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Quarterly Progress Reports and Financial Status Reports must be submitted within 30 days after the end of every calendar
quarter_i.e. no later than January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30_regardless of the project's start date. The
reporting periods covered by each quarterly report end 30 days before the respective deadline for the report. When
an award period begins December 1, for example, the first Quarterly Progress Report describing project activities
between December 1 and December 31 will be due on January 30. A Financial Status Report should be submitted even if funds
have not been obligated or expended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By documenting what has happened over the past three months, Quarterly Progress Reports provide an opportunity for
project staff and Institute staff to resolve any questions before they become problems, and make any necessary changes
in the project time schedule, budget allocations, etc. Thus, the Quarterly Project Report should describe project
activities, their relationship to the approved timeline, and any problems encountered and how they were resolved,
and outline the tasks scheduled for the coming quarter. It is helpful to attach copies of relevant memos, draft products,
or other requested information. An original and one copy of a Quarterly Progress Report and attachments should be
submitted to the Institute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional Quarterly Progress Report or Financial Status Report forms may be obtained from the grantee's Program
Manager at SJI, or photocopies may be made from the supply received with the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Do reporting requirements differ for renewal grants or package grants?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recipients of a continuation, on-going support, or package grant are required to submit quarterly progress and financial
status reports on the same schedule and with the same information as recipients of a grant for a single new project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A continuation or an on-going support grant should be considered as a supplement to and extension of the original award,
and the reports numbered accordingly. For example, if the last quarterly report filed under the original award is
report number six, the first report including a portion of the renewal grant should be report number seven. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recipients of a package grant should file a summary Financial Status Report covering the entire package as well as
separate financial reports for each of the projects in the package, identified by letter of the alphabet (e.g., SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;A;
SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;B; SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What information about project activities should be communicated to SJI?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, grantees should provide prior notice of critical project events such as advisory board meetings or training
sessions so that the Institute Program Manager can attend if possible. If methodological, schedule, staff, budget
allocations, or other significant changes become necessary, the grantee should contact the Institute's program
monitor prior to implementing any of these changes, so that possible questions may be addressed in advance. Questions
concerning the financial requirements section of the Guideline, quarterly financial reporting or payment requests,
should be addressed to the Chief or Deputy Chief of the Institute's Finance and Management Division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is helpful to include the grant number assigned to the award on all correspondence to the Institute.

4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Why is it important to address the special conditions that are attached to the award document?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In some instances, a list of special conditions is attached to the award document. The special conditions are imposed
to establish a schedule for reporting certain key information, to assure that the Institute has an opportunity to
offer suggestions at critical stages of the project, and to provide reminders of some, but not all of the requirements
contained in the Grant Guideline. Accordingly, it is important for grantees to check the special conditions carefully
and discuss with their Program Manager any questions or problems they may have with the conditions. Most concerns
about timing, response time, and the level of detail required can be resolved in advance through a telephone conversation.
The Institute's primary concern is to work with grantees to assure that their projects accomplish their objectives,
not to enforce rigid bureaucratic requirements. However, if a grantee fails to comply with a special condition or
with other grant requirements, the Institute may, after proper notice, suspend payment of grant funds or terminate
the grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections X., XI., and XII. of the Grant Guideline contain the Institute's administrative and financial requirements.
Institute Finance and Management Division staff are always available to answer questions and provide assistance
regarding these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What is a Grant Adjustment?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A Grant Adjustment is the Institute's form for acknowledging the satisfaction of special conditions, or approving
changes in grant activities, schedule, staffing, sites, or budget allocations requested by the project director.
It also may be used to correct errors in grant documents, add small amounts to a grant award, or deobligate funds from
the grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What schedule should be followed in submitting requests for reimbursements or advance payments?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Requests for reimbursements or advance payments may be made at any time after the project start date and before the
end of the 90-day close-out period. However, the Institute follows the U.S. Treasury's policy limiting advances
to the minimum amount required to meet immediate cash needs. Given normal processing time, grantees should not seek
to draw down funds for periods greater than 30 days from the date of the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Do procedures for submitting requests for reimbursement or advance payment differ for renewal grants or package
grants?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The basic procedures are the same for any grant. A continuation or an on-going support grant should be considered as
a supplement to and extension of the original award, and the payment requests numbered accordingly. For example,
if the last payment request under the original award is number nine, then the first request for funds from the continuation
award should be number ten. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recipients of a package grant should file separate requests for each project in the package. For example, if there
are three projects within a package grant, a grantee should prepare three separate payment requests, each identified
by the letter of the alphabet designated in the award document (e.g., SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;A;
SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;B; SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;C). Subsequent
payment requests should be numbered consecutively for each project within the package (e.g., project SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;A
payment number 2; SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;B payment number 4; etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If things change during the grant period, can funds be reallocated from one budget category to another?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Institute recognizes that some flexibility is required in implementing a project design and budget. Thus, grantees
may shift funds among direct cost budget categories. When any one reallocation or the cumulative total of reallocations
are expected to exceed five percent of the approved project budget, a grantee must specify the proposed changes, explain
the reasons for the changes, and request Institute approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same standard applies to renewal grants and package grants. In addition, prior written Institute approval is
required to shift leftover funds from the original award to cover activities to be conducted under the renewal award,
or to use renewal grant monies to cover costs incurred during the original grant period. Prior written Institute approval
also is needed to shift funds between projects included in a package grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What is the 90-day close-out period?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Following the last day of the grant, a 90-day period is provided to allow for all grant-related bills to be received
and posted, and grant funds drawn down to cover these expenses. No obligations of grant funds may be incurred during
this period. The last day on which an expenditure of grant funds can be obligated is the end date of the grant period.
Similarly, the 90-day period is not intended as an opportunity to finish and disseminate grant products. This should
occur before the end of the grant period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Starting the day after the end of the award period, and during the following 90 days, all monies that have been obligated
should be expended. All payment requests must be received by the end of the 90-day ``close-out-period.'' Any unexpended
monies held by the grantee that remain after the 90-day follow-up period must be returned to the Institute. Any funds
remaining in the grant that have not been drawn down by the grantee will be deobligated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Are funds granted by SJI ``Federal'' funds?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State Justice Institute Act provides that, except for purposes unrelated to this question, ``the Institute shall
not be considered a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government.'' 42 U.S.C. &sect;10704(c)(1).
Because SJI receives appropriations from Congress, some grantee auditors have reported SJI grants funds as ``Other
Federal Assistance.'' This classification is acceptable to SJI but is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If SJI is not a Federal Agency, do OMB circulars apply with respect to audits?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Except to the extent that they are inconsistent with the express provisions of the SJI Grant Guideline, OMB Circulars
A&hyph;110, A&hyph;21, A&hyph;87, A&hyph;88, A&hyph;102, A&hyph;122, A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133 are incorporated
into the Grant Guideline by reference. Because the Institute's enabling legislation specifically requires the
Institute to ``conduct, or require each recipient to provide for, an annual fiscal audit'' [see 42 U.S.C. &sect;10711(c)(1)],
the Grant Guideline sets forth options for grantees to comply with this statutory requirement. (See Section XI.J.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to FY 1994, the Institute did not require grantees to comply with the audit-related provisions of OMB circulars
A&hyph;110, A&hyph;128, or A&hyph;133, but did require that grantees, lacking an audit report prepared for a Federal
agency, conduct an independent audit in compliance with generally accepted auditing standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Guideline makes it clear that SJI will accept audits conducted in accordance with the Single Audit Act
of 1984 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;128, or A&hyph;133, in satisfaction of the annual
fiscal audit requirement. Grantees who are required to undertake these audits in conjunction with Federal grants
may include SJI funds as part of the audit even if the receipt of SJI funds would not require such audits. This approach
gives grantees an option to fold SJI funds into the governmental audit rather than to undertake a separate audit to
satisfy SJI's Guideline requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute requires that non-profit grantees perform an A&hyph;133 type of audit if they receive payments totalling
more than $50,000. These audits must be conducted in accordance with the Government Accounting Standards issued
by the Comptroller General of the United States and must include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. An opinion on whether the financial statements of the grantee present fairly its financial position and the results
of its financial operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. A report on the grantee's internal control structure over financial reporting; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. A report on the tests of compliance with applicable laws and regulations that have a direct and material effect on
the financial statement amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For grantees receiving SJI grant payments totalling $50,000 or less during their fiscal year, the annual fiscal audit
may be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, grantees that receive payments from the Institute of more than $50,000 in a fiscal year must have their annual
audit conducted in accordance with Government Accounting Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United
States rather than with generally accepted auditing standards. Grantees that receive $50,000 or less from SJI in
a fiscal year must also submit an annual audit to SJI, but they would have the option to conduct an audit of the entire
grantee organization in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards; include SJI funds in an audit of
Federal funds conducted in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984 and OMB Circular A&hyph;128 or A&hyph;133;
or conduct an audit of only the SJI funds in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. (See Guideline
Section XI.J.2.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Does SJI have a CFDA number?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Auditors often request that a grantee provide the Institute's Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number
for guidance in conducting an audit in accordance with Government Accounting Standards. Because SJI is not a Federal
agency, it has not been issued such a number, and there are no additional compliance tests to satisfy under the Institute's
audit requirements beyond those of a standard governmental audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, because SJI is not a Federal agency, SJI funds should not be aggregated with Federal funds to determine if
$50,000 or more in assistance was received in a fiscal year. For example, if in fiscal year 1994 grantee ``X'' received
$10,000 in Federal funds from a Department of Justice (DOJ) grant program and $20,000 in grant funds from SJI, the new
SJI requirements would not be triggered. The same distinction would preclude an auditor from considering the additional
SJI funds in determining what Federal requirements apply to the DOJ funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantees who are required to satisfy either the Single Audit Act, OMB Circular A&hyph;128, or A&hyph;133, and who
include SJI grant funds in those audits, need to remember that because of its status as a private non-profit corporation,
SJI is not on routing lists of cognizant Federal agencies. Therefore, the grantee needs to submit a copy of the audit
report prepared for such a cognizant Federal agency directly to SJI. The Institute's audit requirements may be found
in Section XI.J.2. of the Grant Guideline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Guideline sets forth the proposed programmatic, financial, and administrative requirements of grants, cooperative
agreements, and contracts awarded by the State Justice Institute. The Institute, a private, nonprofit corporation
established by an Act of Congress, is authorized to award grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to improve
the administration and quality of justice in the State courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grants may be awarded to State and local courts and their agencies; national nonprofit organizations controlled
by, operating in conjunction with, and serving the judicial branch of State governments; and national nonprofit
organizations for the education and training of judges and support personnel of the judicial branch of State governments.
The Institute may also award grants to other nonprofit organizations with expertise in judicial administration;
institutions of higher education; individuals, partnerships, firms, or corporations; and private agencies with
expertise in judicial administration if the objectives of the funded program can be better served by such an entity.
Funds may be awarded, as well, to Federal, State or local agencies and institutions other than courts for services
that cannot be provided adequately through nongovernmental arrangements. In addition, the Institute may provide
financial assistance in the form of interagency agreements with other grantors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute will consider applications for funding support that address any of the areas specified in its enabling
legislation as amended. However, the Board of Directors of the Institute has designated certain program categories
as being of special interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute has established one round of competition for FY 1995 funds. The concept paper submission deadline for
all but two funding categories is November 23, 1994. Concept papers proposing projects that follow up on the November
1994 National Conference on the Management of Mass Tort Cases must be mailed by March 10, 1995. Concept papers to implement
the plans developed at the March 1995 National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts must be
mailed by October 6, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that between $11 million and $11.5 million will be available for award. This Guideline applies to
all concept papers and applications submitted, as well as grants awarded in FY 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The awards made by the State Justice Institute are governed by the requirements of this Guideline and the authority
conferred by Pub. L. 98&hyph;620, Title II, 42 U.S.C. 10701, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State Justice Institute (``Institute'') was established by Pub. L. 98&hyph;620 to improve the administration
of justice in the State courts in the United States. Incorporated in the State of Virginia as a private, nonprofit corporation,
the Institute is charged, by statute, with the responsibility to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Direct a national program of financial assistance designed to assure that each citizen of the United States is provided
ready access to a fair and effective system of justice; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Foster coordination and cooperation with the Federal judiciary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Promote recognition of the importance of the separation of powers doctrine to an independent judiciary; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Encourage education for judges and support personnel of State court systems through national and State organiza-tions,
including universities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To accomplish these broad objectives, the Institute is authorized to provide funds to State courts, national organiza-tions
which support and are supported by State courts, national judicial education organizations, and other organizations
that can assist in improving the quality of justice in the State courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute is supervised by an eleven-member Board of Directors appointed by the President, by and with the consent
of the Senate. The Board is statutorily composed of six judges, a State court administrator, and four members of the
public, no more than two of whom can be of the same political party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through the award of grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements, the Institute is authorized to perform the following
activities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Support research, demonstrations, special projects, technical assistance, and training to improve the adminis-tration
of justice in the State courts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Provide for the preparation, publication, and dissemination of information regarding State judicial systems;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Participate in joint projects with Federal agencies and other private grantors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Evaluate or provide for the evaluation of programs and projects funded by the Institute to determine their impact
upon the quality of criminal, civil, and juvenile justice and the extent to which they have contributed to improving
the quality of justice in the State courts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Encourage and assist in furthering judicial education; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Encourage, assist, and serve in a consulting capacity to State and local justice system agencies in the develop-ment,

B. Special Interest Program Categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. General Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Institute is interested in funding both innovative programs and programs of proven merit that can be replicated
in other jurisdictions. Although applications in any of the statutory program areas are eligible for funding in FY
1995, the Institute is especially interested in funding those projects that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Formulate new procedures and techniques, or creatively enhance existing arrangements to improve the courts;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Address aspects of the State judicial systems that are in special need of serious attention; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Have national significance in terms of their impact or replicability in that they develop products, services and
techniques that may be used in other States; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Create and disseminate products that effectively transfer the information and ideas developed to relevant audiences
in State and local judicial systems or provide technical assistance to facilitate the adaptation of effective programs
and procedures in other State and local jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A project will be identified as a ``Special Interest'' project if it meets the four criteria set forth above and (1)
it falls within the scope of the ``special interest'' program areas designated below, or (2) information coming to
the attention of the Institute from the State courts, their affiliated organizations, the research literature,
or other sources demonstrates that the project responds to another special need or interest of the State courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concept papers and applications which address a ``Special Interest'' category will be accorded a preference in the
rating process. (See the selection criteria listed in sections VI.B., ``Concept Paper Submission Requirements
for New Projects,'' and VIII.B., ``Application Review Procedures.'')

2. Specific Categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has designated the areas set forth below as ``Special Interest'' program categories. The order of listing
does not imply any ordering of priorities among the categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Improving Public Confidence in the Courts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This category includes research, demonstration, evaluation and education projects designed to improve the public's
confidence in the State courts' ability to administer justice fairly, and to test innovative methods for eliminating
economic, racial, ethnic, cultural or gender-based barriers to justice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants should be aware that the Institute is supporting two national conferences addressing issues on the relationship
between the courts and the communities they serve. The National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in
the Courts will be held March 2&hyph;5, 1995 in Albuquerque, New Mexico; the National Videoconference Town Hall Meeting
on Enhancing Public Confidence in the Courts is scheduled for June, 1995 at sites to be selected. (See also, section
II.B.2.i, infra.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute is particularly interested in supporting innovative projects that examine, develop, and test methods
that trial or appellate courts may use to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;respond to the needs of the culturally, demographically, economically and physically diverse public the
courts serve; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;address court-community problems resulting from the influx of legal and illegal immigrants, including projects
to define the impact of immigration on State courts; design and assess procedures for use in custody, visitation,
and other domestic relations cases when key family members or property are outside the United States; facilitate
communication with Federal authorities when illegal aliens are involved in State court proceedings; and develop
protocols to facilitate service of process, the enforcement of orders of judgment, and the disposition of criminal
and juvenile cases when a non-U.S. citizen or corporation is involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;handle cases involving pro se litigants fairly and effectively; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;increase public understanding of jury decisions and the juror selection and service process; foster positive
attitudes toward jury service; and enhance the attractiveness of juror service through, e.g., incentives to participate,
modifications of terms of service, and/or juror orientation and education programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institute funds may not be used to directly or indirectly support legal representation of individuals in specific
cases. In addition, it is unlikely that the Institute will support development or testing of additional automated
kiosks such as those being used by the courts in Arizona, California, and Florida. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previous SJI-supported projects that address these issues include: evaluation of an experimental community court
in New York City; development of a manual for management of court interpretation services and materials for training
and assisting court interpreters; development of touchscreen computer systems, videotapes and written materials
to assist pro se litigants; a demonstration of the use of volunteers to monitor guardianships; studies of effective
and efficient methods of providing legal representation to indigent parties in criminal and family cases and the
applicability of various dispute resolution procedures to different cultural groups; guidelines for court-annexed
day care systems; and development of a manual for implementing innovations in jury selection, use, and management;
technical assistance and training to facilitate implementation of the Standards on Jury Management; development
of a guide for making juries accessible to persons with disabilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Education and Training for Judges and Other Key Court Personnel. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Institute continues to be interested in supporting an array of projects to strengthen and broaden the availability
of court education programs at the State, regional, and national levels. Accordingly, this category is divided into
five subsections: (i) State Initiatives; (ii) National and Regional Education Programs; (iii) Judicial Education
Technical Assistance; (iv) Conferences; and (v) Scholarships. All Institute-supported conferences and education
and training seminars should be accessible to persons with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State Initiatives. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This category includes support for training projects developed or endorsed by a State's courts for the benefit of
judges and other court personnel in that State. Funding of these initiatives does not include support for training
programs conducted by national providers of judicial education unless such a program is designed specifically for
a particular State and has the express support of the State Chief Justice, State Court Administrator, or State Judicial
Educator. The types of programs to be supported within this category should be defined by individual State need but
may include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Development of State Court Education Programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Projects to assist development of State court education programs include, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Seed money for the creation of an ongoing State-based entity for planning, developing, and administering
judicial education programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Seed money for innovative interdisciplinary and, as appropriate, interbranch educational programs, such
as those addressing: (1) The development of better working relationships across court divisions and between courts
and criminal justice, social service, and treatment agencies; (2) organizational and leadership development,
including team-building; and (3) the specific educational needs of nonsupervisory staff as well as those filling
more direct managerial roles; and (4) the development and implementation of strategies for coping with the gap between
resources and the demand for services; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The development of the expertise, information, and commitment required for the preparation and implementation
of State court education plans, including model plans for career-long education of the judiciary (e.g., new judge
training and orientation followed by continuing education and career development) and for the career-long education
of court managers, clerks, and other court personnel.

Curriculum Adaptation Projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Description of the Program. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is reserving up to $350,000 to provide support for adaptation and implementation of model curricula and/or
model training programs previously developed with SJI support. The exact amount to be awarded for curriculum adaptation
grants will depend on the number and quality of the applications submitted in this category and other categories of
the Guideline. The program is designed to provide State and local courts with sufficient support to prepare and conduct
a State-specific or regional modification of a model curriculum, course module, national or regional conference
program, or other model education program developed with SJI funds by any other State or national organization. An
illustrative list of the curricula that may be appropriate for the adaptation is contained in Appendix VII. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only State or local courts may apply for Curriculum Adaptation funding. Grants to support adaptation of educational
programs previously developed with SJI funds are limited to no more than $20,000 each. As with other awards to State
or local courts, cash or in-kind match must be provided equal to at least 50% of the grant amount requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review Criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Curriculum Adaptation grants will be awarded on the basis of criteria including: the need for the educational program;
the need for outside funding to support the program; the likelihood of effective implementation; and expressions
of interest by the judges and/or court personnel who would be directly involved in or affected by the project. In making
implementation awards, the Institute will also consider factors such as the reasonableness of the amount requested,
compliance with the statutory match requirements, diversity of subject matter, geographic diversity, the level
of appropriations available in the current year, and the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Project Description. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Why is this education program needed at the present time? What is the model curriculum or training program to be tested?
How will it be adapted for State use, and who will be responsible for adapting the model curriculum? Who will the participants
be, how will they be recruited, and from where will they come (e.g., from across the State, from a single local jurisdiction,
from a multi-State region)? How many participants are anticipated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Need for funding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Why cannot State or local resources fully support the modification and presentation of the model curriculum? What
is the potential for replicating or integrating the program in the future using State or local funds, once it has been
successfully adapted and tested? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Likelihood. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What is the proposed date for presenting the program? What types of modifications in the length, format, and content
of the model curriculum are anticipated? How will the presentation of the program be evaluated and by whom? (Ordinarily,
an outside evaluation is not necessary.) What measures will be taken to facilitate subsequent presentations of the
adapted program?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Judicial Education Technical Assistance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unlike the preceding categories which support direct training, ``Technical Assistance'' refers to services necessary
for the development of effective educational projects for judges and other court personnel. Projects in this category
should focus on the needs of the States, and applicants should demonstrate their ability to work effectively with
State judicial educators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute is currently funding the following judicial education technical assistance projects: the Judicial
Education Reference Information and Technology Transfer Project (JERITT), which collects and disseminates information
(as well as providing technical assistance) on continuing education programs for judges and court personnel; the
Judicial Education/Adult Education Project (JEAEP), which provides expert assistance on the application of adult

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Judicial Response to Crime,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to enable State and Federal judges, legislators, prosecutors, defense counsel, corrections officials, legal academics,
social science researchers, media representatives, and members of the public to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Evaluate what is known about the impact of current sentencing practices on adult offenders, juvenile offenders
tried as adults, and juvenile offenders, the criminal and juvenile justice systems, and the public's perception
of justice; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Explore how changes in sentencing legislation and judicial practices might better accomplish the goals of
sentencing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Identify changes in procedure, new sources of information or education, and other innovations that might
better assure that a sentence serves the judge's intended sentencing goal(s) in a particular case; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Recommend specific changes in law, policy, and procedure that would help courts better accomplish the goals
of sentencing and improve the public's confidence in the justice system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the topics which could be addressed at the Symposium would be: the impact that Federal and State sentencing guidelines,
mandatory minimums, and other determinate sentencing approaches have had on the courts and other components of the
criminal justice system, the public, and offenders; whether these approaches have fulfilled their envisioned purposes;
whether sentencing innovations (e.g., giving judges greater access to information about the offender, the victim,
and available sentencing options; changed plea bargaining practices; and greater use of intermediate sanctions)
might better assure just and effective sentencing; and whether current sentencing legislation, processes, and
decisions adequately reflect the public's expectations of justice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Institute has supported over 20 projects examining methods for improving caseflow in various types and levels
of courts, or training judges and court managers on pretrial and trial management. The Institute is interested in
supporting a symposium that would bring together litigation delay researchers, technical assistance providers,
trial and appellate court judges and managers both from courts that have not successfully implemented programs for
improving caseflow and reducing the time to disposition as well as those that have, State court administrators, attorneys,
scholars, and others to synthesize and share the information resulting from the projects funded by the Institute
and others; determine the approaches to pretrial, trial, and individual docket management that appear to be most
effective and the best methods for implementing them; identify the programs that may be needed to assist courts in
further reducing litigation delay; define and prioritize the topics for further research on improving caseflow
management; and encourage and assist courts that are experiencing litigation delay to undertake measures to ensure
the prompt and fair disposition of cases.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Program Description/Scholarship Amounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purposes of the Institute scholarship program are to: enhance the knowledge, skills, and abilities of judges
and court managers; enable State court judges and court managers to attend out-of-State educational programs sponsored
by national and State providers that they could not otherwise attend because of limited State, local and personal
budgets; and provide States, judicial educators, and the Institute with evaluative information on a range of judicial
and court-related education programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scholarships will be granted to individuals only for the purpose of attending an out-of-State educational program
within the United States. The annual or midyear meeting of a State or national organization of which the applicant
is a member does not qualify as an out-of-State educational program for scholarship purposes, even though it may include
workshops or other training sessions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This category includes research, evaluation, and demonstration projects addressing the findings and recommendations
developed at the National Symposium on Court-Connected Dispute Resolution Research, conducted in Orlando in October
1993. The Institute is interested in projects that enhance the courts' ability to compare findings among research
studies; address the nature and operation of ADR programs within the context of the court system as a whole; compare
dispute resolution processes to attorney settlement as well as trial; and promote the ability of the courts to move
toward on-going self-evaluation of court-connected dispute resolution programs. Among the topics of greatest
interest are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The Structure of Court-Connected Dispute Resolution Programs including such issues as the appropriate timing
for referrals to dispute resolution services and the effects implementing such referrals at various stages during
litigation; the effect of different referral methods including any differences in outcome between voluntary and
mandatory referrals; cultural issues, including the nature of cultural conflict and its effect on outcomes; and
approaches that provide rural courts and other under-served areas with adequate court-connected dispute resolution
services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. The Selection, Qualifications and Training of Court-Connected Neutrals including what selection procedures
are most effective; what standards should be used to qualify a neutral; what constitutes effective dispute resolution
training; on what basis and when people should be eliminated from the training process; how courts can maintain and
improve neutrals' skills; and how ineffective neutrals should be removed from the pool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. Innovative uses of court-connected dispute resolution for resolving complex cases including land-use litigation.

In previous funding cycles, grants have been awarded to support evaluation of the use of mediation in civil, domestic
relations, juvenile, medical malpractice, appellate, and minor criminal cases. SJI grants also have supported
assessments of the impact of early neutral evaluation of motor vehicle cases, the impact of private judging on State
courts, multi-door courthouse programs, arbitration of civil cases, and civil settlement programs. In addition,
SJI has supported the creation of a consumer guide to choosing a mediator; the development of training programs for
judges; and technical assistance on implementation of multi-door courthouse programs, developing standards for
court-annexed mediation programs, examination of the applicability of various dispute resolution procedures
to different cultural groups, and creation of a national database of court-connected dispute resolution programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants should be aware that the Institute will not provide operational support for on-going ADR programs. Courts
also should be advised that it is preferable for the applicant to support operational costs of a new program, with Institute
funds targeted to support related technical assistance, training, and evaluation needs.

Planning and Managing the Future of the Courts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Institute is interested in supporting activities that would enable courts to implement and evaluate long-range
strategic planning processes and complementary innovative management approaches in their own jurisdictions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The types of projects that fall within this category are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Development, implementation, institutionalization, and evaluation of long-range planning approaches
in individual States and local jurisdictions, e.g., the development or inclusion of strategic planning techniques,
environmental scanning, trends analysis, benchmarking, and other comprehensive long-range, strategic planning
methods as components of courts' current planning processes or as part of the initiation of such a process; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Adaptation, implementation and evaluation of innovative management approaches, such as total quality management,
designed to complement, enhance or support use of a long-range strategic planning process. This includes the development
and testing of performance standards and other techniques to enable trial and appellate court officials to conduct
user evaluations of the quality of court services and to measure public, internal, and supplier satisfaction as a
means to improve court performance. Also included is the planning, implementation, and evaluation of innovative
delay and cost reduction programs including assessments of the advantages and disadvantages of privatizing court
activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Development, implementation, and evaluation of mechanisms for linking assessments of effectiveness such
as the Trial Court Performance Standards to fiscal planning and budgeting, including service efforts and accomplishments
approaches (SEA), performance audits, and performance budgeting; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Development, presentation and evaluation of training necessary to enable judges and court staff to participate
productively in the implementation or institutionalization of the planning process and/or related innovative
management approaches, including training to enhance the ability of courts to develop effective plans for coping
with natural other disasters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute has supported futures commissions in seven States. Because the Board of Directors believes that a sufficient
variety of commission models now exists, the Institute will not support the development or implementation of any
State futures commissions in FY 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute also has supported planning, futures, and innovative management projects including: national and
Statewide ``future and the courts'' conferences and training; development of curricula, guidebooks and a video
on visioning, and a long-range planning guide for trial courts; the provision of technical assistance to courts conducting
futures and long-range planning activities, including development of a court futures network on Internet; a test
of the feasibility of implementing the Trial Court Performance Standards in four States; the development of Appellate
Court Performance Standards; the application of total quality management principles to court operations, and the

In previous funding cycles, the Institute supported a national and a State symposium on courts, children, and the
family; a national symposium on enhancing coordination of cases involving the same family that are being heard in
different courts; development and evaluation of a curriculum addressing the adjudication of allegations of child
sexual abuse when custody is in dispute; and the development and testing of curricula to enhance judges' understanding
of the dynamics of family violence and guide them in adjudication family violence cases and custody cases in which
spousal abuse is involved. In addition, the Institute has supported studies of the appropriate use of mediation in
child abuse cases and in divorce, custody, and visitation cases involving family violence; development of a video
and other materials for parties and children awaiting a court hearing in domestic relations cases involving family
violence; a benchbook for judges on child abuse and neglect caws stemming from parental substance abuse; curricula

This category includes the testing of innovative applications of technology to improve the operation of court management
systems and judicial practices at both the trial and appellate court levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute seeks to support local experiments with promising but untested applications of technology in the courts
that include a structured evaluation of the impact of the technology in terms of costs, benefits, and staff workload.
In this context, ``untested'' refers to novel applications of technology developed for the private sector and other
fields that have not previously been applied to the courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute is particularly interested in supporting efforts to determine what benefits and problems may occur
as a result of courts entering the ``information superhighway,'' including projects to establish standards for
judicial electronic data interchange (EDI); local, Statewide, and/or interstate demonstrations of the courts'
use of EDI (i.e., the exchange of documents or data in a computerized format that enables courts to process or perform
work electronically on the documents received) beyond simple image transfer (facsimile or computer-imaging);
and demonstrations and evaluations of innovative judicial/court uses of electronic communications networks including
those required to meet the reporting mandates contained in recent Federal legislation such as the Brady Act and the
National Child Protection Act. In addition, the Institute is interested in demonstrations and evaluation of the
effective use of management information systems to monitor, assess, and predict evolving court needs; and evaluations
of innovative technologies highlighted at the Fourth National Conference on Court Technology held in Nashville
in October 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ordinarily, the Institute will not provide support for the purchase of equipment or software in order to implement
a technology that has been thoroughly tested in other jurisdictions such as the establishment of videolinks between
courts and jails, the use of optical imaging for recordkeeping, and the creation of an automated management information
system. (See section XI.H.2.b. regarding other limits on the use of grant funds to purchase equipment and software.)

Substance Abuse.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This category includes the development and evaluation of innovative techniques for courts to handle the increasing
volume of substance abuse-related criminal, civil, juvenile and domestic relations cases fairly and expeditiously;
and the planning and presentation of seminars or other educational forums for judges, probation officers, caseworkers,
and other court personnel to examine court-related issues concerning alcohol and other drug abuse and develop specific
plans for how individual courts can respond effectively to the impact of substance abuse-related cases on their ability
to manage their overall caseloads fairly and efficiently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute is particularly interested in funding innovative projects which evaluate the applicability of court-enforced
treatment programs to substance abuse-related cases involving juveniles and cases requiring treatment services
in addition to substance abuse treatment (e.g., spousal abuse, child abuse, or mental health cases); establish coordinated
efforts between local courts and treatment providers for the effective disposition of cases involving substance
abuse; or evaluate the effectiveness of various court responses to treating substance abuse. Proposals should demonstrate
a direct impact on the ability of State courts to handle cases involving substance abuse fairly and effectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute will not fund projects focused on developing additional assessment tools, establishing court-enforced
treatment programs for adult substance abusers, or providing support for basic court or treatment services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute is currently supporting the presentation of a National Symposium on the Implementation and Operation
of Court-Enforced Drug Treatment Programs. In previous funding cycles, the Institute has sponsored a National Conference
on Substance Abuse and the Courts, and State efforts to implement the plans developed at that Conference. It has also
supported projects to evaluate court-enforced treatment programs initiated by the Dade County, Florida, Pulaski
County, Arkansas, and New York City courts, and the effectiveness of other court-based alcohol and drug assessment
programs; replicate the Dade County program in non-urban sites; assess the impact of legislation and court decisions
dealing with drug-affected infants, and strategies for coping with increasing caseload pressures; develop a benchbook
to assist judges in child abuse and neglect cases involving parental substance abuse; test the use of a dual diagnostic
treatment model for domestic violence cases in which substance abuse was a factor; and present local and regional
educational programs for judges and other court personnel on substance abuse and its treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) also are supporting two technical assistance projects:
one by the National Center for State Courts to assist courts in implementing the plans developed at the National Conference;
and the other by the American University Court Technical Assistance Project to identify successful drug case management
strategies, conduct seminars on drug case management, and develop a guidebook for implementing drug case processing
initiatives. In addition, the Institute and the Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance Abuse
Treatment (CSAT) have entered into inter-agency agreement to conduct regional training programs for State judges
and legislators on substance abuse treatment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of the Program.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board will set aside up to $600,000 of Fiscal Year 1995 funds (in addition to any technical assistance funds remaining
from Fiscal Year 1994) to support the provision of technical assistance to State and local courts. The exact amount
to be awarded for these grants will depend on the number and quality of the applications submitted in this category
and other categories of the Guideline. It is anticipated, however, that at least $150,000 will be available each quarter
to support Technical Assistance grants. The program is designed to provide State and local courts with sufficient
support to obtain technical assistance to diagnose a problem, develop a response to that problem, and initiate implementation
of any needed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Assistance grants are limited to no more than $30,000 each, and may cover the cost of obtaining the services
of expert consultants, travel by a team of officials from one court to examine a practice, program or facility in another
jurisdiction that the applicant court is interested in replicating, or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technical assistance must be completed within 12 months after the start-date of the grant. Only State or local
courts may apply for Technical Assistance grants. As with other awards to State or local courts, cash or in-kind match
must be provided equal to at least 50% of the grant amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Assistance grant recipients also are subject to the same quarterly reporting requirements as other Institute
grantees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the conclusion of the grant period, a Technical Assistance grant recipient must complete a Technical Assistance
Evaluation Form. The grantee also must submit to the Institute two copies of a final report that explains how it intends
to act on the consultant's recommendations as well as two copies of the consultant's written report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review Criteria.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Technical Assistance grants will be awarded on the basis of criteria including: whether the assistance would address
a critical need of the court; the soundness of the technical assistance approach to the problem; the qualifications
of the consultant(s) to be hired, or the specific criteria that will be used to select the consultant(s); commitment
on the part of the court to act on the consultant's recommendations; and the reasonableness of the proposed budget.
The Institute will also consider factors such as the level and nature of the match that would be provided, diversity
of subject matter, geographic diversity, and the level of appropriations available to the Institute in the current
year and the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application Procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In lieu of concept papers and formal applications, applicants for Technical Assistance grants may submit, at any
time, an original and three copies of a detailed letter describing the proposed project and addressing the criteria
listed above. Letters from an individual trial or appellate court must be signed by the presiding judge or manager
of that court. Letters from the State court system must be signed by the Chief Justice or State Court Administrator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there is no prescribed form for the letter nor a minimum or maximum page limit, letters of application should
include the following information to assure that each of the criteria is addressed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Need for Funding.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 What is the critical need facing the court? How will the proposed technical assistance help the court to meet this critical
need? Why cannot State or local resources fully support the costs of the required consultant services? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Project Description.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 What tasks would the consultant be expected to perform? Who (organization or individual) would be hired to provide
the assistance and how was this consultant selected? If a consultant has not yet been identified, what procedures
and criteria would be used to select the consultant? (Applicants are expected to follow their jurisdiction's normal
procedures for procuring consultant services.) What is the time frame for completion of the technical assistance?
How would the court oversee the project and provide guidance to the consultant? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the consultant has been identified, a letter from that individual or organization documenting interest in and
availability for the project, as well as the consultant's ability to complete the assignment within the proposed
time period and for the proposed cost, should accompany the applicant's letter. The consultant must agree to submit
a detailed written report to the court and the Institute upon completion of the technical assistance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the support or cooperation of agencies, funding bodies, organizations, or courts other than the applicant, would
be needed in order for the consultant to perform the required tasks, written assurances of such support or cooperation
must accompany the application letter. Support letters also may be submitted under separate cover; however, to ensure
that there is sufficient time to bring them to the attention of the Board's Technical Assistance Committee, letters
sent under separate cover must be received not less than two weeks prior to the Board meeting at which the technical
assistance requests will be considered (i.e., by November 4, 1994; February 17, 1995; April 28, 1995; and July 14,
1995).

Likelihood of implementation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What steps have been/will be taken to facilitate implementation of the consultant's recommendations upon completion
of the technical assistance? For example, if the support or cooperation of other agencies, funding bodies, organizations,
or a court other than the applicant will be needed to adopt the changes recommended by the consultant and approved by
the court, how will they be involved in the review of the recommendations and development of the implementation plan?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Budget and matching State contribution. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A completed Form E, ``Preliminary Budget'' (see Appendix IV to the Grant Guideline), must be included with the applicant's
letter requesting technical assistance. Please note that the estimated cost of the technical assistance services
should be broken down into the categories listed on the budget form rather than aggregated under the Consultant/Contractual
category. In addition, the budget should provide for submission of three copies of the consultant's final report
to the Institute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Support for the project from the State supreme court or its designated agency or council. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Written concurrence on the need for the technical assistance must be submitted. This concurrence may be a copy of SJI
Form B (see Appendix V.) signed by the Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court or the Chief Justice's designee, or a
letter from the State Chief Justice or designee. The concurrence may be submitted with the applicant's letter or under
separate cover prior to consideration of the application. The concurrence also must specify whether the State Supreme
Court would receive, administer, and account for the grant funds, if awarded, or would designate the local court or
a specified agency or council to receive the funds directly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Letters of application may be submitted at any time; however, all of the letters received during a calendar quarter
will be considered at one time. Applicants submitting letters between October 1, 1994, and January 15, 1995, will
be notified of the Board's decision by March 31, 1995; those submitting letters between January 16, and March 15, 1995,
will be notified by May 31, 1995. Notification of the Board's decisions concerning letters received between March
16 and June 15, 1995, will be made by August 31, 1995; and applicants submitting letters between June 16 and September
29, 1995, will be notified by November 30, 1995. The Board has delegated its authority to approve these grants to its
Technical Assistance Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Assistance grant program described in this section should not be confused with the Judicial Education

match is the direct outlay of funds by the grantee to support the project. In-kind match consists of contributions
of time, services, space, supplies, etc., made to the project by the grantee or others (e.g., advisory board members)
working directly on the project. Under normal circumstances, allowable match may be incurred only during the project
period. When appropriate, and with the prior written permission of the Institute, match may be incurred from the date
of the Institute Board of Directors' approval of an award. Match does not include project-related income such as tuition
or revenue from the sale of grant products, or the time of participants attending an education program. Amounts contributed
as cash or in-kind match may not be recovered through the sale of grant products during or following the grant period.

IV. Eligibility for Award 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In awarding funds to accomplish these objectives and purposes, the Institute has been authorized by Congress to award
grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to State and local courts and their agencies (42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1)(A));
national nonprofit organizations controlled by, operating in conjunction with, and serving the judicial branches
of State governments (42 U.S.C. 10705 (b)(1)(B)); and national nonprofit organizations for the education and training
of judges and support personnel of the judicial branch of State governments (42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1)(C)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant will be considered a national education and training applicant under section 10705(b)(1)(C) if: (1)
The principal purpose or activity of the applicant is to provide education and training to State and local judges and
court personnel; and (2) the applicant demonstrates a record of substantial experience in the field of judicial education
and training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute also is authorized to make awards to other nonprofit organizations with expertise in judicial administration,
institutions of higher education, individuals, partnerships, firms, corporations, and private agencies with
expertise in judicial administration, provided that the objectives of the relevant program area(s) can be served
better. In making this judgment, the Institute will consider the likely replicability of the projects' methodology
and results in other jurisdictions. For-profit organizations are also eligible for grants and cooperative agreements;
however, they must waive their fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute may also make awards to Federal, State or local agencies and institutions other than courts for services
that cannot be adequately provided through nongovernmental arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Institute may enter into inter-agency agreements with other public or private funders to support projects
consistent with the purpose of the State Justice Institute Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each application for funding from a State or local court must be approved, consistent with State law, by the State's
Supreme Court or its designated agency or council. The latter shall receive all Institute funds awarded to such courts
and be responsible for assuring proper administration of Institute funds, in accordance with section XI.B.2. of
this Guideline. A list of persons to contact in each State regarding approval of applications from State and local
courts and administration of Institute grants to those courts is contained in Appendix I.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Except as specified below, concept papers and applications for new projects other than national conferences,
and applications for continuation grants may request funding in amounts up to $300,000, although new and continuation
awards in excess of $200,000 are likely to be rare and to be made, if at all, only for highly promising proposals that
will have a significant impact nationally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applications for on-going support grants may request funding in amounts up to $600,000, except as provided in paragraph
V.C.3. At the discretion of the Board, the funds to support on-going support grants may be awarded either entirely
from the Institute's appropria-tions for the fiscal year of the award or from the Institute's appropriations for
successive fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year of the award. When funds to support the full amount of an on-going
support grant are not awarded from the appropriations for the fiscal year of award, funds to support any subsequent
years of the grant will be made available upon (1) the satisfactory performance of the project as reflected in the quarterly
Progress Reports required to be filed and grant monitoring, and (2) the availability of appropriations for that fiscal
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. An application for a package grant may request funding in an amount up to a total of $750,000 per year.

VI. Concept Paper Submission Requirements for New Projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concept papers are an extremely important part of the application process because they enable the Institute to learn
the program areas of primary interest to the courts and to explore innovative ideas, without imposing heavy burdens
on prospective applicants. The use of concept papers also permits the Institute to better project the nature and amount
of grant awards. This requirement and the submission deadlines for concept papers and applications may be waived
for good cause (e.g., the proposed project would provide a significant benefit to the State courts or the opportunity
to conduct the project did not arise until after the deadline). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Format and Content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All concept papers must include a cover sheet, a program narrative, and a preliminary budget, regardless of whether
the applicant is proposing a single project or a ``package of projects,'' or whether the applicant is requesting accelerated
award of a grant of less than $40,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Cover Sheet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cover sheet for all concept papers must contain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A title describing the proposed project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The name and address of the court, organization or individual submitting the paper; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The name, title, address (if different from that in b.), and telephone number of a contact person(s) who can provide
further information about the paper; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The letter of the Special Interest Category (see section II.B.2.) or the number of the statutory Program Area (see
section II.B.1.) that the proposed project addresses most directly; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The estimated length of the proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants requesting the Board to waive the application requirement and approve a grant of less than $40,000 based
on the concept paper, should add APPLICATION WAIVER REQUESTED to the information on the cover page. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The program narrative of a concept paper describing a single project should be no longer than necessary, but 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in no case should exceed eight (8) double-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper. Margins must not be less than 1 inch and
type no smaller than 12 point and 12 cpi must be used. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The narrative should describe: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Why this project is needed and how it will benefit State courts? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the project is to be conducted in a specific location(s), applicants should discuss the particular needs of the
project site(s) to be addressed by the project, why those needs are not being met through the use of existing materials,
programs, procedures, services or other resources, and the benefits that would be realized by the proposed sites(s).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the project is not site specific, applicants should discuss the problems that the proposed project will address,
why existing materials, programs, procedures, services or other resources do not adequately resolve those problems,
and the benefits that would be realized from the project by State courts generally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to use the results? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A description of the products that will result, the degree to which they will be applicable to courts across the nation,
and the manner in which the products and results of the project will be disseminated.

Concept Papers Requesting a Package Grant Covering More Than One Project. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The program narrative of a concept paper requesting a package grant (see definition in section III.I.) should be no
longer than necessary, but in no case should exceed 15 double-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper. Margins must not
be less than 1 inch, and type no smaller than 12-point and 12 cpi must be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to addressing the issues listed in paragraph VI.A.2.a., the program narrative of a package grant concept
paper must describe briefly each component project, as well as how its inclusion enhances the entire package; and
explain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. How are the proposed projects related? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. How would their operation and administration be enhanced if they were funded as a package rather than as individual
projects; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. What disadvantages, if any, would accrue by considering or funding them separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concept Papers Requesting a Package Grant Covering More Than One Project.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A separate preliminary budget for each component project of the package, as well as a combined budget that reflects
the costs of the entire package, must be attached to the narrative. Each project budget must be identified by the title
that corresponds to the narrative description of the project in the program narrative and a letter of the alphabet
(i.e. A, B, C). Each of these budgets must include the estimates and information specified on Form E included in Appendix
IV of this Guideline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concept Papers Requesting Accelerated Award of a Grant of Less than $40,000.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applicants requesting a waiver of the application requirement and approval of a grant based on a concept paper under
section VI.C., must attach to Form E (see Appendix IV) a budget narrative explaining the basis for each of the items
listed, and whether the costs would be paid from grant funds or through a matching contribution or other sources. The
budget narrative is not counted against the eight-page limit for the program narrative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Institute encourages concept paper applicants to attach letters of cooperation and support from the courts
and related agencies that will be involved in or directly affected by the proposed project. Letters of support also
may be sent under separate cover. However, in order to ensure that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's
attention, support letters sent under separate cover must be received no later than January 13, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Institute will not accept concept papers with program narratives exceeding the limits set in sections VI.A.2.a.
and b. The page limit does not include the cover page, budget form, the budget narrative if required under section VI.A.3.c.,
and any letters of cooperation or endorsements. Additional material should not be attached unless it is essential
to impart a clear understanding of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants submitting more than one concept paper may include material that would be identical in each concept
paper in a cover letter, and incorporate that material by reference in each paper. The incorporated material will
be counted against the eight-page limit for each paper. A copy of the cover letter should be attached to each copy of
each concept paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Sample concept papers from previous funding cycles are available from the Institute upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Selection Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. All concept papers will be evaluated by the staff on the basis of the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The demonstration of need for the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The soundness and innovativeness of the approach described; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The benefits to be derived from the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The reasonableness of the proposed budget; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The proposed project's relationship to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. The degree to which the findings, procedures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, technology, or other results of the project can be transferred to other jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. ``Single jurisdiction'' concept papers submitted pursuant to section II.C. will be rated on the proposed project's
relation to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B., and on the special requirements
listed in section II.C.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In determining which concept papers will be selected for development into full applications, the Institute will
also consider the availability of financial assistance from other sources for the project; the amount and nature
(cash or in-kind) of the applicant's anticipated match; whether the applicant is a State court, a national court support
or education organization, a non-court unit of government, or another type of entity eligible to receive grants under
the Institute's enabling legislation (see 42 U.S.C. 10705(b) (as amended) and section IV above); the extent to which
the proposed project would also benefit the Federal courts or help the State courts enforce Federal constitutional
and legislative requirements, and the level of appropriations available to the Institute in the current year and
the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Review Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concept papers will be reviewed competitively by the Board of Directors. Institute staff will prepare a narrative
summary and a rating sheet assigning points for each relevant selection criterion for those concept papers which
fall within the scope of the Institute's funding program and merit serious consideration by the Board. Staff will
also prepare a list of those papers that, in the judgment of the Executive Director, propose projects that lie outside
the scope of the Institute's funding program or are not likely to merit serious consideration by the Board. The narrative
summaries, rating sheets, and list of non-reviewed papers will be presented to the Board for their review. Committees
of the Board will review concept paper summaries within assigned program areas and prepare recommendations for the
full Board. The full Board of Directors will then decide which concept paper applicants should be invited to submit
formal applications for funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to invite an application is solely that of the Board of Directors. With regard to concept papers requesting
a package grant, the Board retains discretion to invite an application including all, none, or selected portions
of the package for possible funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board may waive the application requirement and approve a grant based on a concept paper for a project requiring
less than $40,000, when the need for and benefits of the project are clear, and the methodology and budget require little
additional explanation.

D. Submission Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An original and three copies of all concept papers submitted for consideration in Fiscal Year 1995 must be sent by first
class or overnight mail or by courier no later than November 23, 1994, except for concept papers proposing projects
that follow-up on the National Conference on the Managment of Mass Tort Cases which must be sent by March 10, 1995 (see
section II.B.2.l.), and concept papers proposing to implement an action plan developed during the National Conference
on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts which must be sent by October 6, 1995 (see section II.B.2.i.). A postmark
or courier receipt will constitute evidence of the submission date. All envelopes containing concept papers should
be marked CONCEPT PAPER and should be sent to: State Justice Institute, 1650 King Street, Suite 600, Alexandria, Virginia
22314. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is preferable for letters of cooperation and support to be appended to the concept paper when it is submitted. If
support letters are sent under separate cover, they must be received no later than January 13, 1995 in order to ensure
that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's attention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute will send written notice to all persons submitting concept papers of the Board's decisions regarding
their papers and of the key issues and questions that arose during the review process. A decision by the Board not to
invite an application may not be appealed, but does not prohibit resubmission of the concept paper or a revision thereof
in a subsequent round of funding. The Institute will also notify the designated State contact listed in the Appendix
when the Board invites applications that are based on concept papers which are submitted by courts within their State
or which specify a participating site within their State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Receipt of each concept paper will be acknowledged in writing. Extensions of the deadline for submission of concept
papers will not be granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program narrative should address the following topics: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Project Objectives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A clear, concise statement of what the proposed project is intended to accomplish. In stating the objectives of the
project, applicants should focus on the overall programmatic objective (e.g., to enhance understanding and skills
regarding a specific subject, or to determine how a certain procedure affects the court and litigants) rather than
on operational objectives (e.g., provide training for 32 judges and court managers, or review data from 300 cases).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Need for the Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the project is to be conducted in a specific location(s), a discussion of the particular needs of the project site(s)
to be addressed by the project and why those needs are not being met through the use of existing materials, programs,
procedures, services or other resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the project is not site specific, a discussion of the problems that the proposed project will address, and why existing
materials, programs, procedures, services or other resources do not adequately resolve those problems. The discussion
should include specific references to the relevant literature and to the experience in the field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An application requesting a package grant to support more than one project also must describe how the proposed projects
in the package are related; how their operation and administration would be enhanced if they were funded as a package
rather than as individual projects; and what disadvantages, if any, would accrue by considering or funding them separately.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Tasks, Methods and Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tasks and Methods.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A delineation of the tasks to be performed in achieving the project objectives and the methods to be used for accomplishing
each task. For example: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
For research and evaluation projects,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the data sources, data collection strategies, variables to be examined, and analytic procedures to be used for conducting
the research or evaluation and ensuring the validity and general applicability of the results. For projects involving
human subjects, the discussion of methods should address the procedures for obtaining respondents' informed consent,
ensuring the respondents' privacy and freedom from risk or harm, and the protection of others who are not the subjects
of research but would be affected by the research. If the potential exists for risk or harm to the human subjects, a discussion
should be included of the value of the proposed research and the methods to be used to minimize or eliminate such risk.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
For education and training projects,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the adult education techniques to be used in designing and presenting the program, including the teaching/ learning
objectives of the educational design, the teaching methods to be used, and the opportunities for structured interaction
among the participants; how faculty will be recruited, selected, and trained; the proposed number and length of the
conferences, courses, seminars or workshops to be conducted; the materials to be provided and how they will be developed;
and the cost to participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

For demonstration projects,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the demonstration sites and the reasons they were selected, or if the sites have not been chosen, how they will be identified
and their cooperation obtained; how the program or procedures will be implemented and monitored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
For technical assistance projects,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the types of assistance that will be provided; the particular issues and problems for which assistance will be provided;
how requests will be obtained and the type of assistance determined; how suitable providers will be selected and briefed;
how reports will be reviewed; and the cost to recipients.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application requesting a package grant for more than one project must describe separately the tasks associated
with each project in the proposed package. Each project must be identified by a separate letter of the alphabet (i.e.,
A, B, C) and a descriptive title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Every project design must include an evaluation plan to determine whether the project met its objectives. The evaluation
should be designed to provide an objective and independent assessment of the effectiveness or usefulness of the training
or services provided; the impact of the procedures, technology or services tested; or the validity and applicability
of the research conducted. In addition, where appropriate, the evaluation process should be designed to provide
ongoing or periodic feedback on the effectiveness or utility of particular programs, educational offerings, or
achievements which can then be further refined as a result of the evaluation process. The plan should present the qualifications
of the evaluator(s); describe the criteria, related to the project's programmatic objectives, that will be used
to evaluate the project's effectiveness; explain how the evaluation will be conducted, including the specific data
collection and analysis techniques to be used; discuss why this approach is appropriate; and present a schedule for
completion of the evaluation within the proposed project period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation plan should be appropriate to the type of project proposed. For example: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. An evaluation approach suited to many 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
research 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
projects is a review by an advisory panel of the research methodology, data collection instruments, preliminary
analyses, and products as they are drafted. The panel should be comprised of independent researchers and practitioners
representing the perspectives affected by the proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. The most valuable approaches to evaluating 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
educational or training 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
programs will serve to reinforce the participants' learning experience while providing useful feedback on the impact
of the program and possible areas for improvement. One appropriate evaluation approach is to assess the acquisition
of new knowledge, skills, attitudes or understanding through participant feedback on the seminar or training event.
Such feedback might include a self-assessment on what was learned along with the participant's response to the quality
and effectiveness of faculty presentations, the format of sessions, the value or usefulness of the material presented
and other relevant factors. Another appropriate approach would be to use an independent observer who might request
verbal as well as written responses from participants in the program. When an education project involves the development
of curricular materials an advisory panel of relevant experts can be coupled with a test of the curriculum to obtain
the reactions of participants and faculty as indicated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. The evaluation plan for a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
demonstration 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
project should encompass an assessment of program effectiveness (e.g., how well did it work?); user satisfaction,
if appropriate; the cost-effectiveness of the program; a process analysis of the program (e.g., was the program implemented
as designed? did it provide the services intended to the targeted population?); the impact of the program (e.g., what
effect did the program have on the court? what benefits resulted from the program?); and the replicability of the program
or components of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. For 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
technical assistance 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
projects, applicants should explain how the quality, timeliness, and impact of the assistance provided will be determined,
and should develop a mechanism for feedback from both the users and providers of the technical assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
v. Evaluation plans involving 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
human subjects 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
should include a discussion of the procedures for obtaining respondents' informed consent, ensuring the respondents'
privacy and freedom from risk or harm, and the protection of others who are not the subjects of evaluation but would
be affected by it. Other than the provision of confidentiality to respondents, human subjects protection issues
ordinarily are not applicable to participants evaluating an education program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vi. The evaluation plan in a package grant application should address the issues listed above for the particular types
of projects included in the package, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the individual components as well
as the benefits and limitations of the projects as a package.

5. Project Management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A detailed management plan including the starting and completion date for each task; the time commitments to the project
of key staff and their responsibilities regarding each project task; and the procedures that will be used to ensure
that all tasks are performed on time, within budget, and at the highest level of quality. In preparing the project time
line, Gantt Chart, or schedule, applicants should make certain that all project activities, including publication
or reproduction of project products and their initial dissemination will occur within the proposed project period.
The management plan must also provide for the submission of Quarterly Progress and Financial Reports within 30 days
after the close of each calendar quarter (i.e., no later than January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Package grant applications must include a management plan for each project included in the package with the same project
title and alphabetic identifier describing the project in the program narrative, as well as a plan embracing the package
as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A description of the products to be developed by the project (e.g., training curricula and materials, videotapes,
articles, manuals, or handbooks), including when they will be submitted to the Institute. The application must explain
how and to whom the products will be disseminated; describe how they will benefit the State courts including how they
can be used by judges and court personnel; identify development, production, and dissemination costs covered by
the project budget; and present the basis on which products and services developed or provided under the grant will
be offered to the courts community and the public at large (i.e. whether products will be distributed at no cost to recipients,
or if costs are involved, the reason for charging recipients and the estimated price of the product). Ordinarily,
applicants should schedule all product preparation and distribution activities within the project period. Applicants
also should provide for the preparation of a one-page abstract summarizing products resulting from a project for
inclusion on the Institute's electronic bulletin board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Package grant applications must discuss these issues with regard to the products that would result from each of the
projects included in the package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The type of products to be prepared depend on the nature of the project. For example, in most instances, the products
of a research, evaluation, or demonstration project should include an article summarizing the project findings
that is publishable in a journal serving the courts community nationally, an executive summary that will be disseminated
to the project's primary audience, or both. Applicants proposing to conduct empirical research or evaluation projects
with national import should describe how they will make their data available for secondary analysis after the grant
period. (See section X.W.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The curricula and other products developed by education and training projects should be designed for use outside
the classroom so that they may be used again by original participants and others in the course of their duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants must provide for submitting a final draft of the final grant product(s) to the Institute for review and
approval at least 30 days before the product(s) are submitted for publication or reproduction. No grant funds may
be obligated for publication or reproduction of a final grant product without the written approval of the Institute.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants must also provide for including in all project products a prominent acknowledgment that support was received
from the Institute and a disclaimer paragraph based on the example provided in section X.Q. of the Guideline. The ``SJI''
logo must appear on the front cover of a written product, or in the opening frames of a video product, unless the Institute
approves another placement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty copies of all project products, including videotapes, must be submitted to the Institute. In addition, a copy
of each product must be sent to the library established in each State to collect the materials developed with Institute
support. (A list of these libraries is contained in Appendix II.) To facilitate their use, all videotaped products
should be distributed in VHS format. For all wordprocessed products, grantees must submit a diskette of the text in
ASCII. For non-text products, a copy of the summary or a brief abstract in ASCII must be submitted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the cooperation of courts, organizations, agencies, or individuals other than the applicant is required to conduct
the project, written assurances of cooperation and availability should be attached as an appendix to the application,
or they may be sent under separate cover. In order to ensure that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's
attention, letters of support sent under separate cover must be received at least four weeks before the meeting of
the Board of Directors at which the application will be considered (i.e., no later than October 17, 1994, February
1, 1995, March 31, 1995, June 23, 1995, or August 18, 1995, respectively).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Budget Narrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The budget narrative should provide the basis for the computation of all project-related costs. An application for
a package grant for more than one project must include a separate budget narrative for each project component, with
the same alphabetic identifier and project title used to describe each component project in the program narrative.
Additional background or schedules may be attached if they are essential to obtaining a clear understanding of the
proposed budget. Numerous and lengthy appendices are strongly discouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget narrative should cover the costs of all components of the project and clearly identify costs attributable
to the project evaluation. Under OMB grant guidelines incorporated by reference in this Guideline, grant funds may
not be used to pay for coffee breaks during seminars or meetings, or to purchase alcoholic beverages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Justification of Personnel Compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant should set forth the percentages of time to be devoted by the individuals who will serve as the staff of
the proposed project, the annual salary of each of those persons, and the number of work days per year used for calculating
the percentages of time or daily rate of those individuals. The applicant should explain any deviations from current
rates or established written organization policies. If grant funds are requested to pay the salary and related costs
for a current employee of a court or other unit of government, the applicant should explain why this would not constitute
a supplantation of State or local funds in violation of 42 U.S.C. 10706 (d)(1). An acceptable explanation may be that
the position to be filled is a new one established in conjunction with the project or that the grant funds will be supporting
only the portion of the employee's time that will be dedicated to new or additional duties related to the project.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant should provide a description of the fringe benefits provided to employees. If percentages are used,
the authority for such use should be presented as well as a description of the elements included in the determination
of the percentage rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Consultant/Contractual Services and Honoraria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant should describe the tasks each consultant will perform, the estimated total amount to be paid to each
consultant, the basis for compensation rates (e.g., number of days &times; the daily consultant rates), and the method
for selection. Rates for consultant services must be set in accordance with section XI.H.2.c. Honorarium payments
must be justified in the same manner as other consultant payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Travel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transportation costs and per diem rates must comply with the policies of the applicant organization. If the applicant
does not have an established travel policy, then travel rates shall be consistent with those established by the Institute
or the Federal Government. (A copy of the Institute's travel policy is available upon request.) The budget narrative
should include an explanation of the rate used, including the components of the per diem rate and the basis for the estimated
transportation expenses. The purpose for travel should also be included in the narrative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant funds may be used to purchase only the equipment that is necessary to demonstrate a new technological application
in a court, or that is otherwise essential to accomplishing the objectives of the project. Equipment purchases to
support basic court operations ordinarily will not be approved. The applicant should describe the equipment to be
purchased or leased and explain why the acquisition of that equipment is essential to accomplish the project's goals
and objectives. The narrative should clearly identify which equipment is to be leased and which is to be purchased.
The method of procurement should also be described. Purchases for automatic data processing equipment must comply
with section XI.H.2.b. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Supplies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant should provide a general description of the supplies necessary to accomplish the goals and objectives
of the grant. In addition, the applicant should provide the basis for the amount requested for this expenditure category.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Construction expenses are prohibited except for the limited purposes set forth in section X.H.2. Any allowable construction
or renovation expense should be described in detail in the budget narrative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Telephone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants should include anticipated telephone charges, distinguishing between monthly charges and long distance
charges in the budget narrative. Also, applicants should provide the basis used in developing the monthly and long
distance estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Postage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Anticipated postage costs for project-related mailings should be described in the budget narrative. The cost of
special mailings, such as for a survey or for announcing a workshop, should be distinguished from routine operational
mailing costs. The bases for all postage estimates should be included in the justification material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Printing/Photocopying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Anticipated costs for printing or photocopying should be included in the budget narrative. Applicants should provide
the details underlying these estimates in support of the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Indirect Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants should describe the indirect cost rates applicable to the grant in detail. If costs often included within
an indirect cost rate are charged directly (e.g., a percentage of the time of senior managers to supervise product
activities), the applicant should specify that these costs are not included within their approved indirect cost
rate. These rates must be established in accordance with section XI.H.4. If the applicant has an indirect cost rate
or allocation plan approved by any Federal granting agency, a copy of the approved rate agreement should be attached
to the application.

12. Match 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant should describe the source of any matching contribution and the nature of the match provided. Any additional
contributions to the project should be described in this section of the budget narrative as well. If in-kind match
is to be provided, the applicant should describe how the amount and value of the time, services or materials actually
contributed will be documented sufficiently clearly to permit them to be included in an audit of the grant. Applicants
should be aware that the time spent by participants in education courses does not qualify as in-kind match. (Samples
of forms used by current grantees to track in-kind match are available from the Institute upon request.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants that do not contemplate making matching contributions continuously throughout the course of the project
or on a task-by-task basis must provide a schedule within 30 days after the beginning of the project period indicating
at what points during the project period the matching contributions will be made. (See sections III.F., VIII.B.,
X.B. and XI.D.1.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Submission Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. An application package containing the application, an original signature on FORM A (and on FORM B, if the application
is from a State or local court, or on the Disclosure of Lobbying Form if the applicant is not a unit of State or local government),
and four photo-copies of the application package must be sent by first class or overnight mail, or by courier no later
than May 10, 1995. A postmark or courier receipt will constitute evidence of the submission date. Please mark application
on all application package envelopes and send to: State Justice Institute, 1650 King Street, Suite 600, Alexandria,
Virginia 22314. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Receipt of each proposal will be acknowledged in writing. Extensions of the deadline for receipt of applications
will not be granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants invited to submit more than one application may include material that would be identical in each application
in a cover letter, and incorporate that material by reference in each application. The incorporated material will
be counted against the 25-page (or in the case of package grant applications, the 40-page) limit for the program narrative.
A copy of the cover letter should be attached to each copy of each application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. It is preferable for letters of cooperation or support to be appended to the application when it is submitted. If
support letters are sent under separate cover, they must be received no later than four weeks before the meeting of
the Board of Directors at which the application will be considered (i.e. no later than October 17, 1994, February 1,
1995, March 31, 1995, June 23, 1995, or August 18, 1995, respectively) in order to ensure that there is sufficient time
to bring them to the Board's attention.

VIII. Application Review Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Preliminary Inquiries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Institute staff will answer inquiries concerning application procedures. The staff contact will be named in
the Institute's letter inviting submission of a formal application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Selection Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. All applications will be rated on the basis of the criteria set forth below. The Institute will accord the greatest
weight to the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The soundness of the methodology; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The appropriateness of the proposed evaluation design; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The qualifications of the project's staff; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The applicant's management plan and organizational capabilities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The reasonableness of the proposed budget; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. The demonstration of need for the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. The products and benefits resulting from the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. The demonstration of cooperation and support of other agencies that may be affected by the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The proposed project's relationship to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B.;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. The degree to which the findings, procedures, training, technology, or other results of the project can be transferred
to other jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. ``Single jurisdiction'' applications submitted pursuant to section II.C.1. will also be rated on the proposed
project's relation to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B. and on the special requirements
listed in section II.C.1.b. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In determining which applicants to fund, the Institute will also consider whether the applicant is a State court,
a national court support or education organization, a non-court unit of government, or other type of entity eligible
to receive grants under the Institute's enabling legislation (see 42 U.S.C. 10705(6) (as amended) and Section IV
above); the availability of financial assistance from other sources for the project; the amount and nature (cash
or in-kind) of the applicant's match; the extent to which the proposed project would also benefit the Federal courts
or help the State courts enforce Federal constitutional and legislative requirements; and the level of appropriations
available to the Institute in the current year and the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Review and Approval Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications will be reviewed competitively by the Board of Directors. The Institute staff will prepare a narrative
summary of each application, and a rating sheet assigning points for each relevant selection criterion. When necessary,
applications may also be reviewed by outside experts. Committees of the Board will review applications within assigned
program categories and prepare recommendations to the full Board. The full Board of Directors will then decide which
applications to approve for a grant. The decision to award a grant is solely that of the Board of Directors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Awards approved by the Board will be signed by the Chairman of the Board on behalf of the Institute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Return Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless a specific request is made, unsuccessful applications will not be returned. Applicants are advised that Institute
records are subject to the provisions of the Federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Notification of Board Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Institute will send written notice to applicants concerning all Board decisions to approve or deny their respective
applications and the key issues and questions that arose during the review process. A decision by the Board to deny
an application may not be appealed, but does not prohibit resubmission of a concept paper based on that application
in a subsequent round of funding. The Institute will also notify the designated State contact listed in Appendix I
when grants are approved by the Board to support projects that will be conducted by or involve courts in their State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Response to Notification of Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants have 30 days from the date of the letter notifying them that the Board has approved their application to
respond to any revisions requested by the Board. If the requested revisions (or a reasonable schedule for submitting
such revisions) have not been submitted to the Institute within 30 days after notification, the approval will be automatically
rescinded and the application presented to the Board for reconsideration.

IX. Renewal Funding Procedures and Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Institute recognizes two types of renewal funding as described below_``continuation grants'' and ``on-going
support grants.'' The award of an initial grant to support a project does not constitute a commitment by the Institute
to renew funding. The Board of Directors anticipates allocating no more than $3 million of available FY 1995 grant
funds for renewal grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Continuation Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose and Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continuation grants are intended to support projects with a limited duration that involve the same type of activities
as the previous project. They are intended to enhance the specific program or service produced or established during
the prior grant period. They may be used, for example, when a project is divided into two or more sequential phases,
for secondary analysis of data obtained in an Institute-supported research project, or for more extensive testing
of an innovative technology, procedure, or program developed with SJI grant support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for a project to be considered for continuation funding, the grantee must have completed the project tasks
and met all grant requirements and conditions in a timely manner, absent extenuating circumstances or prior Institute
approval of changes to the project design. Continuation grants are not intended to provide support for a project for
which the grantee has underestimated the amount of time or funds needed to accomplish the project tasks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A continuation grant may be awarded for either a single project or for more than one project as a package grant (see sections
III.J., V.C.1 and 3, and V.D.1 and 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Application Procedures_Letters of Intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In lieu of a concept paper, a grantee seeking a continuation grant must inform the Institute, by letter, of its intent
to submit an application for such funding as soon as the need for renewal funding becomes apparent but no less than 120
days before the end of the current grant period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A letter of intent must be no more than 3 single-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper and must contain a concise but
thorough explanation of the need for continuation; an estimate of the funds to be requested; and a brief description
of anticipated changes in scope, focus or audience of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Letters of intent will not be reviewed competitively. Institute staff will review the proposed activities for
the next project period and, within 30 days of receiving a letter of intent, inform the grantee of specific issues to
be addressed in the continuation application and the date by which the application for a continuation grant must be
submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Application Format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application for a continuation grant must include an application form, budget forms (with appropriate documentation),
a project abstract conforming to the format set forth in section VII.B., a program narrative, a budget narrative,
a disclosure of lobbying form from (applicants other than units of State or local government), and certain certifications
and assurances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program narrative should conform to the length and format requirements set forth in section VII.C. However, rather
than the topics listed in section VII.C., the program narrative of an application for a continuation grant should
include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Project Objectives. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A clear, concise statement of what the continuation project is intended to accomplish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Need for Continuation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An explanation of why continuation of the project is necessary to achieve the goals of the project, and how the continuation
will benefit the participating courts or the courts community generally. That is, to what extent will the original
goals and objectives of the project be unful-filled if the project is not continued, and conversely, how will the findings
or results of the project be enhanced by continuing the project? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A continuation application requesting a package grant to support more than one project should explain, in addition,
how the proposed projects are related; how their operation and administration would be enhanced by the grant; the
advantages of funding the projects as a package rather than individually; and the disadvantages, if any, that would
accrue by considering or funding them separately.

Report of Current Project Activities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A discussion of the status of all activities conducted during the previous project period. Applicants should identify
any activities that were not completed, and explain why. A continuation application requesting a package grant must
describe separately the activities undertaken in each of the projects included within the proposed package.

d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation Findings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The key findings, impact, or recommendations resulting from the evaluation of the project, if they are available,
and how they will be addressed during the proposed continuation. If the findings are not yet available, applicants
should provide the date by which they will be submitted to the Institute. Ordinarily, the Board will not consider an
application for continuation funding until the Institute has received the evaluator's report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tasks, Methods, Staff and Grantee Capability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A full description of any changes in the tasks to be performed, the methods to be used, the products of the project, how
and to whom those products will be disseminated, the assigned staff, or the grantee's organizational capacity. Applicants
should include, in addition, the criteria and methods by which the proposed continuation project would be evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A continuation application for a package grant must address these issues separately for each project included in
the proposed package, using the same alphabetic identifiers and project titles as in the original application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Task Schedule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A detailed task schedule and time line for the next project period. A continuation application for a package grant
should include a separate task schedule and timeline for each project included in the proposed package, as well as
a schedule and time line that covers the package of projects as a whole. The same alphabetic identifiers and project
titles used in the original application should be used to identify the component projects in the renewal application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Sources of Support. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An indication of why other sources of support are inadequate, inappropriate or unavailable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Budget and Budget Narrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Provide a complete budget and budget narrative conforming to the requirements set forth in paragraph VII.D. Changes
in the funding level requested should be discussed in terms of corresponding increases or decreases in the scope of
activities or services to be rendered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A continuation application for a package grant must include a separate budget narrative identified alphabetically
(i.e. A, B, C) and by project title for each project component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. References to Previously Submitted Material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application for a continuation grant should not repeat information contained in a previously approved application
or other previously submitted materials, but should provide specific references to such materials where appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The submission requirements set forth in section VII.E., other than the deadline for mailing, apply to applications
for a continuation grant. Such applications will be rated on the selection criteria set forth in section VIII.B. The
key findings and recommendations resulting from an evaluation of the project and the proposed response to those findings
and recommendations will also be considered. The review and approval process, return policy, and notification procedures
are the same as those for new projects set forth in sections VIII.C.&hyph;VIII.E.

1. Purpose and Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On-going support grants are intended to support projects that are national in scope and that provide the State courts
with services, programs or products for which there is a continuing important need. An on-going support grant may
also be used to fund longitudinal research that directly benefits the State courts. On-going support grants are subject
to the limits on size and duration set forth in V.C.2 and V.D.2. A project is eligible for consideration for an on-going
support grant if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The project is supported by and has been evaluated under a grant from the Institute; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
b. The project is national in scope and provides a significant benefit to the State courts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. There is a continuing important need for the services, programs or products provided by the project as indicated
by the level of use and support by members of the court community; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The project is accomplishing its objectives in an effective and efficient manner; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. It is likely that the service or program provided by the project would be curtailed or significantly reduced without
Institute support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each project supported by an on-going support grant must include an evaluation component assessing its effectiveness
and operation throughout the grant period. The evaluation should be independent, but may be designed collaboratively
by the evaluator and the grantee. The design should call for regular feedback from the evaluator to the grantee throughout
the project period concerning recommendations for midcourse corrections or improvement of the project, as well
as periodic reports to the Institute at relevant points in the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An interim evaluation report must be submitted 18 months into the grant period. The decision to obligate Institute
funds to support the third year of the project will be based on the interim evaluation findings and the applicant's
response to any deficiencies noted in the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final evaluation assessing the effectiveness, operation of, and continuing need for the project must be submitted
90 days before the end of the three-year project period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a detailed annual task schedule must be submitted not later than 45 days before the end of the first and
second years of the grant period, along with an explanation of any necessary revisions in the projected costs for the
remainder of the project period. (See also section IX.B.3.h.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Application Procedures_Letters of Intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board will consider awarding an on-going support grant for a period of up to 36 months. The total amount of the grant
will be fixed at the time of the initial award. Funds ordinarily will be made available in annual increments as specified
in section V.C.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In lieu of a concept paper, a grantee seeking an on-going support grant must inform the Institute, by letter, of its
intent to submit an application for such funding as soon as the need for renewal funding becomes apparent but no less
than 120 days before the end of the current grant period. The letter of intent should be in the same format as that prescribed
for continuation grants in section IX.A.2.a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Application Procedures and Format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application for an on-going support grant must include an application form, budget forms (with appropriate documentation),
a project abstract conforming to the format set forth in section VII.B., a program narrative, a budget narrative,
and certain certifications and assurances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program narrative should conform to the length and format requirements set forth in section VII.C. However, rather
than the topics listed in section VII.C., the program narrative of applications for on-going support grants should
address: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of Need for and Benefits of the Project. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Provide a detailed discussion of the benefits provided by the project to the State courts around the country, including
the degree to which State courts, State court judges, or State court managers and personnel are using the services
or programs provided by the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An application for on-going support of a package grant should explain, in addition, how the proposed projects are
related; how their operation and administration would be enhanced by the grant; the advantages of funding the projects
as a package rather than individually; and the disadvantages, if any, that would accrue by considering or funding
them separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Demonstration of Court Support. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Demonstrate support for the continuation of the project from the courts community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report on Current Project Activities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Discuss the extent to which the project has met its goals and objectives, identify any activities that have not been
completed, and explain why. An application for on-going support of a package grant must describe separately the activities
undertaken in each of the projects included within the proposed package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation Findings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attach a copy of the final evaluation report regarding the effectiveness, impact, and operation of the project, specify
the key findings or recommendations resulting from the evaluation, and explain how they will be addressed during
the proposed renewal period. Ordinarily, the Board will not consider an application for on-going support until the
Institute has received the evaluator's report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Objectives, Tasks, Methods, Staff and Grantee Capability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Describe fully any changes in the objectives; tasks to be performed; the methods to be used; the products of the project;
how and to whom those products will be disseminated; the assigned staff; and the grantee's organizational capacity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An application for on-going support of a package grant must address these issues separately for each project included
in the proposed package, using the same alphabetic identifiers and project titles as in the original application.

Task Schedule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Present a general schedule for the full proposed project period and a detailed task schedule for the first year of
the proposed new project period. An application for on-going support of a package grant should include a separate
task schedule and timeline for each project included in the proposed package, as well as a schedule and time line that
covers the package of projects as a whole. The same alphabetic identifiers and project titles used in the original
application should be used to identify the component projects in the renewal application.

4. Budget and Budget Narrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Provide a complete three-year budget and budget narrative conforming to the requirements set forth in paragraph
VII.D. Changes in the funding level requested should be discussed in terms of corresponding increases or decreases
in the scope of activities or services to be rendered. A complete budget narrative should be provided for each year,
or portion of a year, for which grant support is requested. Changes in the funding level requested should be discussed
in terms of corresponding increases or decreases in the scope of activities or services to be rendered. The budget
should provide for realistic cost-of-living and staff salary increases over the course of the requested project
period. Applicants should be aware that the Institute is unlikely to approve a supplemental budget increase for an
on-going support grant in the absence of well-documented, unanticipated factors that clearly justify the requested
increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A continuation application for a package grant must include a separate budget narrative identified alphabetically
(i.e. A, B, C) and by project title for each project component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. References to Previously Submitted Material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application for an on-going support grant should not repeat information contained in a previously approved application
or other previously submitted materials, but should provide specific references to such materials where appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Submission Requirements, Review and Approval Process, and Notification of Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The submission requirements set forth in section VII.E., other than the deadline for mailing, apply to applications
for an on-going support grant. Such applications will be rated on the selection criteria set forth in section VIII.B.
The key findings and recommendations resulting from an evaluation of the project and the proposed response to those
findings and recommendations will also be considered. The review and approval process, return policy, and notification
procedures are the same as those for new projects set forth in sections VIII.C.&hyph;VIII.E.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
X. Compliance Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State Justice Institute Act contains limitations and conditions on grants, contracts and cooperative agreements
of which applicants and recipients should be aware. In addition to eligibility requirements which must be met to be
considered for an award from the Institute, all applicants should be aware of and all recipients will be responsible
for ensuring compliance with the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. State and Local Court Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each application for funding from a State or local court must be approved, consistent with State law, by the State's
Supreme Court, or its designated agency or council. The latter shall receive, administer, and be accountable for
all funds awarded to such courts. 42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(4). Appendix I to this Guideline lists the agencies, councils
and contact persons designated to administer Institute awards to the State and local courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Matching Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. All awards to courts or other units of State or local government (not including publicly supported institu-tions
of higher education) require a match from private or public sources of not less than 50% of the total amount of the Institute's
award. For example, if the total cost of a project is anticipated to be $150,000, a State court or executive branch agency
may request up to $100,000 from the Institute to implement the project. The remaining $50,000 (50% of the $100,000
requested from SJI) must be provided as a match. A cash match, non-cash match, or both may be provided, but the Institute
will give preference to those applicants who provide a cash match to the Institute's award. (For a further definition
of match, see section III.F.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement to provide match may be waived in exceptionally rare circumstances upon approval of the Chief Justice
of the highest court in the State and a majority of the Board of Directors. 42 U.S.C. 10705(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Other eligible recipients of Institute funds are not required to provide a match, but are encouraged to contribute
to meeting the costs of the project. In instances where match is proposed, the grantee is responsible for ensuring
that the total amount proposed is actually contributed. If a proposed contribution is not fully met, the Institute
may reduce the award amount accordingly, in order to maintain the ratio originally provided for in the award agreement
(see sections VIII.B. above and XI.D.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Conflict of Interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Personnel and other officials connected with Institute-funded programs shall adhere to the following requirements:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. No official or employee of a recipient court or organization shall participate personally through decision, approval,
disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise in any proceeding, application,
request for a ruling or other determination, contract, grant, cooperative agreement, claim, controversy, or other
particular matter in which Institute funds are used, where to his/her knowledge he/she or his/her immediate family,
partners, organi-zation other than a public agency in which he/she is serving as officer, director, trustee, partner,
or employee or any person or organization with whom he/she is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective
employment, has a financial interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In the use of Institute project funds, an official or employee of a recipient court or organization shall avoid any
action which might result in or create the appearance of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Using an official position for private gain; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of the Institute program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Requests for proposals or invitations for bids issued by a recipient of Institute funds or a subgrantee or subcontractor
will provide notice to prospective bidders that the contractors who develop or draft specifications, requirements,
statements of work and/or requests for proposals for a proposed procurement will be excluded from bidding on or submitting
a proposal to compete for the award of such procurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Funds awarded to recipients by the Institute shall not be used, indirectly or directly, to influence Executive orders
or similar promulgations by Federal, State or local agencies, or to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation
by Federal, State or local legislative bodies. 42 U.S.C. 10706(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the Board of Directors to award funds only to support applications submitted by organizations that
would carry out the objectives of their applications in an unbiased manner. Consistent with this policy and the provisions
of 42 U.S.C. 10706, the Institute will not knowingly award a grant to an applicant that has, directly or through an entity
that is part of the same organization as the applicant, advocated a position before Congress on the specific subject
matter of the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Political Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No recipient shall contribute or make available Institute funds, program personnel, or equipment to any political
party or association, or the campaign of any candidate for public or party office. Recipients are also prohibited
from using funds in advocating or opposing any ballot measure, initiative, or referendum. Finally, officers and
employees of recipients shall not intentionally identify the Institute or recipients with any partisan or nonpartisan
political activity associated with a political party or association, or the campaign of any candidate for public
or party office. 42 U.S.C. 10706(a).

F. Advocacy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No funds made available by the Institute may be used to support or conduct training programs for the purpose of advocating
particular nonjudicial public policies or encouraging nonjudicial political activities. 42 U.S.C. 10706(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Prohibition Against Litigation Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No funds made available by the Institute may be used directly or indirectly to support legal assistance to parties
in litigation, including cases involving capital punishment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Supplantation and Construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that funds are used to supplement and improve the operation of State courts, rather than to support basic
court services, funds shall not be used for the following purposes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To supplant State or local funds supporting a program or activity (such as paying the salary of court employees who
would be performing their normal duties as part of the project, or paying rent for space which is part of the court's
normal operations); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To construct court facilities or structures, except to remodel existing facilities or to demonstrate new architectural
or technological techniques, or to provide temporary facilities for new personnel or for personnel involved in a
demonstration or experimental program; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Solely to purchase equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Confidentiality of Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided by Federal law other than the State Justice Institute Act, no recipient of financial assistance
from SJI may use or reveal any research or statistical information furnished under the Act by any person and identifiable
to any specific private person for any purpose other than the purpose for which the information was obtained. Such
information and copies thereof shall be immune from legal process, and shall not, without the consent of the person
furnishing such information, be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action, suit, or other judicial,
legislative, or administrative proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Human Research Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All research involving human subjects shall be conducted with the informed consent of those subjects and in a manner
that will ensure their privacy and freedom from risk or harm and the protection of persons who are not subjects of the
research but would be affected by it, unless such procedures and safeguards would make the research impractical.
In such instances, the Institute must approve procedures designed by the grantee to provide human subjects with relevant
information about the research after their involvement and to minimize or eliminate risk or harm to those subjects
due to their participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
K. Nondiscrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No person may, on the basis of race, sex, national origin, disability, color, or creed be excluded from participation
in, denied the benefits of, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity supported by Institute
funds. Recipients of Institute funds must immediately take any measures necessary to effectuate this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
L. Reporting Requirements

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recipients of Institute funds, other than scholarships awarded under section II.B.2.b.v., shall submit Quarterly
Progress and Financial Reports within 30 days of the close of each calendar quarter (that is, no later than January
30, April 30, July 30, and October 30). Two copies of each report must be sent. The Quarterly Progress Reports shall
include a narrative description of project activities during the calendar quarter, the relationship between those
activities and the task schedule and objectives set forth in the approved application or an approved adjustment thereto,
any significant problem areas that have developed and how they will be resolved, and the activities scheduled during
the next reporting period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The quarterly financial status report shall be submitted in accordance with section XI.G.2. of this guideline. A
final project progress report and financial status report shall be submitted within 90 days after the end of the grant
period in accordance with section XI.K.2. of this Guideline.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each recipient must provide for an annual fiscal audit which shall include an opinion on whether the financial statements
of the grantee present fairly its financial position and financial operations are in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. For grantees receiving more than $50,000 in Institute grant payments during their fiscal
year, the audit shall also include reports on the grantee's internal control structure and compliance with applicable
regulations. (See section XI.J. of the Guideline for the requirements of such audits.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After providing a recipient reasonable notice and opportunity to submit written documentation demonstrating why
fund termination or suspension should not occur, the Institute may terminate or suspend funding of a project that
fails to comply substantially with the Act, Institute guidelines, or the terms and conditions of the award. 42 U.S.C.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the conclusion of the project, title to all expendable and nonexpendable personal property purchased with Institute
funds shall vest in the recipient court, organization, or individual that purchased the property if certification
is made to the Institute that the property will continue to be used for the authorized purposes of the Institute-funded
project or other purposes consistent with the State Justice Institute Act, as approved by the Institute. If such certification
is not made or the Institute disapproves such certification, title to all such property with an aggregate or individual
value of $1,000 or more shall vest in the Institute, which will direct the disposition of the property.

R. Institute Approval of Grant Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No grant funds may be obligated for publication or reproduction of a final product developed with grant funds without
the written approval of the Institute. Grantees shall submit a final draft of each such product to the Institute for
review and approval. These drafts shall be submitted sufficiently before the product is scheduled to be sent for publication
or reproduction to permit Institute review and incorporation of any appropriate changes agreed upon by the grantee
and the Institute.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
S. Distribution of Grant Products to State Libraries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees shall send 20 copies of each final product developed with grant funds to the Institute, unless the product
was developed under either a curriculum adaptation or a technical assistance grant, in which case submission of 2
copies is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantees shall send one copy of each final product developed with grant funds to the library established in each State
to collect materials prepared with Institute support. (A list of these libraries is contained in Appendix II. Labels
for these libraries are available from the Institute upon request.) Recipients of curriculum adaptation and technical
assistance grants are not required to submit final products to State libraries.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as otherwise provided in the terms and conditions of an Institute award, a recipient is free to copyright any
books, publications, or other copyrightable materials developed in the course of an Institute-supported project,
but the Institute shall reserve a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise
use, and to authorize others to use, the materials for purposes consistent with the State Justice Institute Act.

U. Inventions and Patents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If any patentable items, patent rights, processes, or inventions are produced in the course of Institute-sponsored
work, such fact shall be promptly and fully reported to the Institute. Unless there is a prior agreement between the
grantee and the Institute on disposition of such items, the Institute shall determine whether protection of the invention
or discovery shall be sought. The Institute will also determine how the rights in the invention or discovery, including
rights under any patent issued thereon, shall be allocated and administered in order to protect the public interest
consistent with ``Government Patent Policy'' (President's Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies,
February 18, 1983, and statement of Government Patent Policy).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When Institute funds fully cover the cost of developing, producing, and disseminating a product, (e.g., a report,
curriculum, videotape or software), the product should be distributed to the field without charge. When Institute
funds only partially cover the development, production, or dissemination costs, the grantee may recover its costs
for developing, reproducing, and disseminating the material to those requesting it, to the extent that those costs
were not covered by Institute funds or grantee matching contributions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants should disclose their intent to sell grant-related products in both the concept paper and the application.
Grantees must obtain the written, prior approval of the Institute of their plans to recover project costs through
the sale of grant products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written requests to recover costs ordinarily should be received during the grant period and should specify the nature
and extent of the costs to be recouped, the reason that such costs were not budgeted (if the rationale was not disclosed
in the approved application), the number of copies to be sold, the intended audience for the products to be sold, and
the proposed sale price. If the product is to be sold for more than $25.00, the written request also should include a
detailed itemization of costs that will be recovered and a certification that the costs were not supported by either
Institute grant funds or grantee matching contributions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, following the end of the grant period, the sale of grant products results in revenues that exceed those costs, the
revenue must continue to be used for the authorized purposes of the Institute-funded project or other purposes consistent
with the State Justice Institute Act that have been approved by the Institute. See sections III.G. and XI.F. for requirements
regarding project-related income.

W. Availability of Research Data for Secondary Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon request, grantees must make available for secondary analysis a diskette(s) or data tape(s) containing research
and evaluation data collected under an Institute grant and the accompanying code manual. Grantees may recover the
actual cost of duplicating and mailing or otherwise transmitting the data set and manual from the person or organization
requesting the data. Grantees may provide the requested data set in the format in which it was created and analyzed.

X. Approval of Key Staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the qualifications of an employee or consultant assigned to a key project staff position are not described in the
application or if there is a change of a person assigned to such a position, a recipient shall submit a description of
the qualifications of the newly assigned person to the Institute. Prior written approval of the qualifications of
the new person assigned to a key staff position must be received from the Institute before the salary or consulting
fee of that person and associated costs may be paid or reimbursed from grant funds.

2. Responsibilities of State Supreme Court 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each application for funding from a State or local court must be approved, consistent with State law, by the State's
Supreme Court, or its designated agency or council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State Supreme Court shall receive all Institute funds awarded to such courts and shall be responsible for assuring
proper administration of Institute funds. The State Supreme Court is responsible for all aspects of the project,
including proper accounting and financial recordkeeping by the subgrantee. The responsibilities include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reviewing Financial Operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State Supreme Court should be familiar with, and periodically monitor, its subgrantees' financial operations,
records system and procedures. Particular attention should be directed to the maintenance of current financial
data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recording Financial Activities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subgrantee's grant award or contract obligation, as well as cash advances and other financial activities, should
be recorded in the financial records of the State Supreme Court in summary form. Subgrantee expenditures should be
recorded on the books of the State Supreme Court 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OR 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
evidenced by report forms duly filed by the subgrantee. Non-Institute contributions applied to projects by subgrantees
should likewise be recorded, as should any project income resulting from program operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Budgeting and Budget Review. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State Supreme Court should ensure that each subgrantee prepares an adequate budget as the basis for its award commitment.
The detail of each project budget should be maintained on file by the State Supreme Court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accounting for Non-Institute Contributions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State Supreme Court will ensure, in those instances where subgrantees are required to furnish non-Institute
matching funds, that the requirements and limitations of this guideline are applied to such funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Audit Requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State Supreme Court is required to ensure that subgrantees have met the necessary audit requirements as set forth
by the Institute (see sections X.M. and XI.J). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting Irregularities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State Supreme Court and its subgrantees are responsible for promptly reporting to the Institute the nature and
circumstances surrounding any financial irregularities discovered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Accounting System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grantee is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of accounting and internal controls
for itself and for ensuring that an adequate system exists for each of its subgrantees and contractors. An acceptable
and adequate accounting system is considered to be one which: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Properly accounts for receipt of funds under each grant awarded and the expenditure of funds for each grant by category
of expenditure (including matching contributions and project income); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Assures that expended funds are applied to the appropriate budget category included within the approved grant;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Presents and classifies historical costs of the grant as required for budgetary and evaluation purposes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provides cost and property controls to assure optimal use of grant funds; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Is integrated with a system of internal controls adequate to safeguard the funds and assets covered, check the accuracy
and reliability of the accounting data, promote operational efficiency, and assure conformance with any general
or special conditions of the grant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Meets the prescribed requirements for periodic financial reporting of operations; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Provides financial data for planning, control, measurement, and evaluation of direct and indirect costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Total Cost Budgeting and Accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accounting for all funds awarded by the Institute shall be structured and executed on a ``total project cost'' basis.
That is, total project costs, including Institute funds, State and local matching shares, and any other fund sources
included in the approved project budget shall be the foundation for fiscal administration and accounting. Grant
applications and financial reports require budget and cost estimates on the basis of total costs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Timing of Matching Contributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Matching contributions need not be applied at the exact time of the obligation of Institute funds. However, the full
matching share must be obligated during the award period, except that with the prior written permission of the Institute,
contributions made following approval of the grant by the Institute's Board but before the beginning of the grant
may be counted as match. Grantees that do not contemplate making matching contributions continuously throughout
the course of a project or on a task-by-task basis, are required to submit a schedule within 30 days after the beginning
of the project period indicating at what points during the project period the matching contributions will be made.
In instances where a proposed cash match is not fully met, the Institute may reduce the award amount accordingly, in
order to maintain the ratio originally provided for in the award agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Records for Match 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All grantees must maintain records which clearly show the source, amount, and timing of all matching contributions.
In addition, if a project has included, within its approved budget, contributions which exceed the required matching
portion, the grantee must maintain records of those contributions in the same manner as it does the Institute funds
and required matching shares. For all grants made to State and local courts, the State Supreme Court has primary responsibility
for grantee/subgrantee compliance with the requirements of this section. (See section XI.B.2.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Maintenance and Retention of Records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All financial records, supporting documents, statistical records and all other records pertinent to grants, subgrants,
cooperative agreements or contracts under grants shall be retained by each organization participating in a project
for at least three years for purposes of examination and audit. State Supreme Courts may impose record retention and
maintenance requirements in addition to those prescribed in this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The retention requirement extends to books of original entry, source documents supporting accounting transactions,
the general ledger, subsidiary ledgers, personnel and payroll records, cancelled checks, and related documents
and records. Source documents include copies of all grant and subgrant awards, applications, and required grantee/subgrantee
financial and narrative reports. Personnel and payroll records shall include the time and attendance reports for
all individuals reimbursed under a grant, subgrant or contract, whether they are employed full-time or part-time.
Time and effort reports will be required for consultants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Retention Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three-year retention period starts from the date of the submission of the final expenditure report or, for grants
which are renewed annually, from the date of submission of the annual expenditure report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees and subgrantees are expected to see that records of different fiscal years are separately identified and
maintained so that requested information can be readily located. Grantees and subgrantees are also obligated to
protect records adequately against fire or other damage. When records are stored away from the grantee's/subgrantee's
principal office, a written index of the location of stored records should be on hand, and ready access should be assured.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees and subgrantees must give any authorized representative of the Institute access to and the right to examine
all records, books, papers, and documents related to an Institute grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Project-Related Income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Records of the receipt and disposition of project-related income must be maintained by the grantee in the same manner
as required for the project funds that gave rise to the income. The policies governing the disposition of the various
types of project-related income are listed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A State and any agency or instrumentality of a State including State institutions of higher education and State hospitals,
shall not be held accountable for interest earned on advances of project funds. When funds are awarded to subgrantees
through a State, the subgrantees are not held accountable for interest earned on advances of project funds. Local
units of government and nonprofit organizations that are direct grantees must refund any interest earned. Grantees
shall so order their affairs to ensure minimum balances in their respective grant cash accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Royalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grantee/subgrantee may retain all royalties received from copyrights or other works developed under projects
or from patents and inventions, unless the terms and conditions of the project provide otherwise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Registration and Tuition Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Registration and tuition fees shall be used to pay project-related costs not covered by the grant, or to reduce the
amount of grant funds needed to support the project. Registration and tuition fees may be used for other purposes only
with the prior written approval of the Institute. Estimates of registration and tuition fees, and any expenses to
be offset by the fees, should be included in the application budget forms and narrative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Income from the Sale of Grant Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When grant funds fully cover the cost of producing and disseminating a limited number of copies of a product, the grantee
may, with the written prior approval of the Institute, sell additional copies reproduced at its expense only at a price
that recovers actual reproduction and distribution costs that were not covered by Institute grant funds or grantee
matching contributions to the project. When grant funds only partially cover the costs of developing, producing
and disseminating a product, the grantee may, with the written prior approval of the Institute, recover costs for
developing, reproducing, and disseminating the material to the extent that those costs were not covered by Institute
grant funds or grantee matching contributions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the sale of products occurs during the project period, the costs and income generated by the sales must be reported
on the Quarterly Financial Status Reports and documented in an auditable manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whenever possible, the intent to sell a product should be disclosed in the concept paper and application or reported
to the Institute in writing once a decision to sell products has been made. The grantee must request approval to recover
its product development, reproduction, and dissemination costs as specified in section X.V.

and conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Payments and Financial Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Payment of Grant Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The procedures and regulations set forth below are applicable to all Institute grant funds and grantees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Request for Advance or Reimbursement of Funds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees will receive funds on a ``Check-Issued'' basis. Upon receipt, review, and approval of a Request for Advance
or Reimbursement by the Institute, a check will be issued directly to the grantee or its designated fiscal agent. A
request must be limited to the grantee's immediate cash needs. The Request for Advance or Reimbursement, along with
the instructions for its preparation, will be included in the official Institute award package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of submitting Requests for Advance or Reimbursement, recipients of continuation and on-going support
grants should consider these grants as supplements to and extensions of the original award and number their requests
on a project rather than a grant basis. (See Recommendations to Grantees in the Introduction for further guidance.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Payment requests for projects within a package grant may be submitted at the same time, but must be calculated separately
by component project. The alphabetic project identifier (A, B, C, etc.) should be appended to the grant number in Block
5 of the Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (See Recommendations to Grantees in the Introduction for further guidance.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Termination of Advance and Reimbursement Funding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a grantee organization receiving cash advances from the Institute: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to attain program or project goals, or to establish procedures that
will minimize the time elapsing between cash advances and disbursements, or cannot adhere to guideline requirements
or special conditions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Engages in the improper award and administration of subgrants or contracts; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. Is unable to submit reliable and/or timely reports;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
the Institute may terminate advance financing and require the grantee organization to finance its operations with
its own working capital. Payments to the grantee shall then be made by check to reimburse the grantee for actual cash
disbursements. In the event the grantee continues to be deficient, the Institute reserves the right to suspend reimbursement
payments until the deficiencies are corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Principle of Minimum Cash on Hand. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recipient organizations should request funds based upon immediate disbursement requirements. Grantees should
time their requests to ensure that cash on hand is the minimum needed for disbursements to be made immediately or within
a few days. Idle funds in the hands of subgrantees will impair the goals of good cash management.

2. Financial Reporting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to obtain financial information concerning the use of funds, the Institute requires that grantees/subgrantees
of these funds submit timely reports for review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two copies of the Financial Status Report are required from all grantees, other than recipients of scholarships under
section II.B.2.b.v., for each active quarter on a calendar-quarter basis. This report is due within 30 days after
the close of the calendar quarter. It is designed to provide financial information relating to Institute funds, State
and local matching shares, and any other fund sources included in the approved project budget. The report contains
information on obligations as well as outlays. A copy of the Financial Status Report, along with instructions for
its preparation, will be included in the official Institute Award package. In circumstances where an organization
requests substantial payments for a project prior to the completion of a given quarter, the Institute may request
a brief summary of the amount requested, by object class, in support of the Request for Advance or Reimbursement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantees receiving a continuation or on-going support grant should provide financial information and number their
quarterly Financial Status Reports on a project rather than a grant basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantees receiving a package grant must submit a quarterly financial report summarizing the financial activity
for the entire package and separate reports for each project within the package. On the separate reports for the component
projects, the alphabetic project identifier (A, B, C, etc.) must be appended to the grant number in Block 5 of the Financial
Status Report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Consequences of Non-Compliance With Submission Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Failure of the grantee organization to submit required financial and program reports may result in a suspension of
grant payments or revocation of the grant award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preagreement Costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The written prior approval of the Institute is required for costs which are considered necessary to the project but
occur prior to the award date of the grant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Equipment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Grant funds may be used to purchase or lease only that equipment which is essential to accomplishing the goals and objectives
of the project. The written prior approval of the Institute is required when the amount of automated data processing
(ADP) equipment to be purchased or leased exceeds $10,000 or the software to be purchased exceeds $3,000.

3. Travel Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transportation and per diem rates must comply with the policies of the applicant organization. If the applicant does
not have an established written travel policy, then travel rates shall be consistent with those established by the
Institute or the Federal Government. Institute funds shall not be used to cover the transportation or per diem costs
of a member of a national organization to attend an annual or other regular meeting of that organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Indirect Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These are costs of an organization that are not readily assignable to a particular project, but are necessary to the
operation of the organization and the performance of the project. The cost of operating and maintaining facilities,
depreciation, and administrative salaries are examples of the types of costs that are usually treated as indirect
costs. It is the policy of the Institute that all costs should be budgeted directly; however, if a recipient has an indirect
cost rate approved by a Federal agency as set forth below, the Institute will accept that rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approved Plan Available.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The Institute will accept an indirect cost rate or allocation plan approved for a grantee during the preceding two
years by any Federal granting agency on the basis of allocation methods substantially in accord with those set forth
in the applicable cost circulars. A copy of the approved rate agreement must be submitted to the Institute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Where flat rates are accepted in lieu of actual indirect costs, grantees may not also charge expenses normally
included in overhead pools, e.g., accounting services, legal services, building occupancy and maintenance, etc.,
as direct costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. Organizations with an approved indirect cost rate, utilizing total direct costs as the base, usually exclude
contracts under grants from any overhead recovery. The negotiation agreement will stipulate that contracts are
excluded from the base for overhead recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Establishment of Indirect Cost Rates.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to be reimbursed for indirect costs, a grantee or organization must first establish an appropriate indirect
cost rate. To do this, the grantee must prepare an indirect cost rate proposal and submit it to the Institute. The proposal
must be submitted in a timely manner (within three months after the start of the grant period) to assure recovery of
the full amount of allowable indirect costs, and it must be developed in accordance with principles and procedures
appropriate to the type of grantee institution involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
No Approved Plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If an indirect cost proposal for recovery of actual indirect costs is not submitted to the Institute within three months
after the start of the grant period, indirect costs will be irrevocably disallowed for all months prior to the month
that the indirect cost proposal is received. This policy is effective for all grant awards.

1. Procurement Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For State and local governments, the Institute is adopting the standards set forth in Attachment O of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OMB Circular A&hyph;102.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations will be governed by the standards
set forth in Attachment O of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OMB Circular A&hyph;110.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Property Management Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The property management standards as prescribed in Attachment N of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OMB Circulars A&hyph;102
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A&hyph;110
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 shall be applicable to all grantees and subgrantees of Institute funds except as provided in section X.O.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All grantees/subgrantees are required to be prudent in the acquisition and management of property with grant funds.
If suitable property required for the successful execution of projects is already available within the grantee or
subgrantee organization, expenditures of grant funds for the acquisition of new property will be considered unnecessary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each non-scholarship grantee (including a State or local court receiving a subgrant from the State Supreme Court)
shall provide for an annual fiscal audit. The audit may be of the entire grantee organization (e.g., a university)
or of the specific project funded by the Institute. Audits conducted in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984
and OMB Circular A&hyph;128, or OMB Circular A&hyph;133 will satisfy the requirement for an annual fiscal audit.
The audit shall be conducted by an independent Certified Public Accountant, or a State or local agency authorized
to audit government agencies. For grantees receiving more than $50,000 in payments during their fiscal year, the
audit shall be conducted in accordance with the Government Accounting Standards issued by the Comptroller General
of the United States and shall include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. An opinion on whether the financial statements of the grantee present fairly its financial position and the results
of its financial operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. A report on the grantee's internal control structure over financial reporting; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. A report on the tests of compliance with applicable laws and regulations that have a direct and material effect on
the financial statement amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For grantees receiving payments totalling $50,000 or less during their fiscal year, the annual fiscal audit may be
conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA). A written report shall be prepared upon completion of the audit. Grantees are responsible
for submitting copies of the reports to the Institute within 30 days after the acceptance of the report by the grantee,
for each year that there is financial activity involving Institute funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantees who receive funds from a Federal agency and who satisfy audit requirements of the cognizant Federal agency,
should submit a copy of the audit report prepared for that Federal agency to the Institute in order to satisfy the provisions
of this section. Cognizant Federal agencies do not send reports to the Institute. Therefore, each grantee must send
this report directly to the Institute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Resolution and Clearance of Audit Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Timely action on recommendations by responsible management officials is an integral part of the effectiveness of
an audit. Each grant recipient shall have policies and procedures for acting on audit recommendations by designating
officials responsible for: follow-up, maintaining a record of the actions taken on recommendations and time schedules,
responding to and acting on audit recommendations, and submitting periodic reports to the Institute on recommendations
and actions taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the general policy of the State Justice Institute not to make new grant awards to an applicant having an unresolved
audit report involving Institute awards. Failure of the grantee organization to resolve audit questions may also
result in the suspension of payments for active Institute grants to that organization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within 90 days after the end date of the grant or any approved extension thereof (revised end date), the following documents
must be submitted to the Institute by a grantee other than a recipient of a scholarship under section II.B.2.b.v. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Financial Status Report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The final report of expenditures must have no unliquidated obligations and must indicate the exact balance of unobligated
funds. Any unobligated/unexpended funds will be deobligated from the award by the Institute. Final payment requests
for obligations incurred during the award period must be submitted to the Institute prior to the end of the 90-day close-out
period. Grantees on a check-issued basis, who have drawn down funds in excess of their obligations/expenditures,
must return any unused funds as soon as it is determined that the funds are not required. In no case should any unused
funds remain with the grantee beyond the submission date of the final financial status report.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon the written request of the grantee, the Institute may extend the close-out period to assure completion of the
Grantee's close-out requirements. Requests for an extension must be submitted at least 14 days before the end of the
close-out period and must explain why the extension is necessary and what steps will be taken to assure that all the
grantee's responsibilities will be met by the end of the extension period.

XII. Grant Adjustments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All requests for program or budget adjustments requiring Institute approval must be submitted in a timely manner
by the project director. All requests for changes from the approved application will be carefully reviewed for both
consistency with this guideline and the enhancement of grant goals and objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Grant Adjustments Requiring Prior Written Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several types of grant adjustments which require the prior written approval of the Institute. Examples
of these adjustments include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Budget revisions among direct cost categories which, individually or in the aggregate, exceed or are expected
to exceed five percent of the approved original budget or the most recently approved revised budget. For the purposes
of this section, the Institute will view budget revisions cumulatively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. For package grants, reallocations among budget categories of an individual project within the package that total

A request to change or extend the grant period must be made at least 30 days in advance of the end date of the grant. A revised

be notified immediately. In such cases, if the grantee/subgrantee wishes to terminate the project, the Institute
will forward procedural instructions upon notification of such intent. If the grantee wishes to continue the project
under the direction of another individual, a statement of the candidate's qualifications should be sent to the Institute
for review and approval. The grant may be terminated if the qualifications of the proposed individual are not approved
in advance by the Institute.

without specific prior approval by the Institute. All such arrangements should be formalized in a contract or other
written agreement between the parties involved. Copies of the proposed contract or agreement must be submitted for
prior approval at the earliest possible time. The contract or agreement must state, at a minimum, the activities to
be performed, the time schedule, the policies and procedures to be followed, the dollar limitation of the agreement,
and the cost principles to be followed in determining what costs, both direct and indirect, are to be allowed. The contract
or other written agreement must not affect the grantee's overall responsibility for the direction of the project
and accountability to the Institute.

The State Justice Institute Act requires that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each application for funding by a State or local court shall be approved, consistent with State law, by the State's
Supreme Court, or its designated agency or council, which shall receive, administer, and be accountable for all funds
awarded by the Institute to such courts. 42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form B should be signed by the Chief Judge or Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court, or by the director of the designated
agency or chair of the designated council. If the designated agency or council differs from the designee listed in
Appendix I to the State Justice Institute Grant Guideline, evidence of the new or additional designation should be
attached.

The term ``State Supreme Court'' refers to the court of last resort of a State. ``Designated agency or council'' refers
to the office or judicial body which is authorized under State law or by delegation from the State Supreme Court to approve
applications for funds and to receive, administer and be accountable for those funds.
