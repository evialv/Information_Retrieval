SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule to redefine the term ``Special Purpose Shipper'' to mean those persons who handle citrus fruit which is
certified as organically grown under Florida law, and requires such persons to certify that they will limit shipments
of such fruit to outlets handling organically grown fruit. This final rule more precisely defines organically grown
Florida citrus fruit, and is designed to increase the market for organic shipments. The rule was unanimously recommended
by the Citrus Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing
order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 87 and Marketing Order No. 905 [7 CFR Part 905] regulating the
handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order.
This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674],
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 100 Florida citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges, grapefruit,
tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and about 11,000 growers of these citrus fruits in Florida. Small agricultural
service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts
of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural growers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000.
A minority of these handlers and a majority of the growers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An interim final rule was issued on May 18, 1994, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 26927, May 25, 1994], with an effective date of May 25, 1994. That rule amended &sect;&sect;905.146, 905.147,
and 905.148 of the rules and regulations in effect under the order. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which
ended June 24, 1994. One comment was received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Joseph B. Procacci, Assistant Chairman, National Association of Perishable Agricultural Receivers, filed
a comment in support of the revisions. He supports the revision in the regulation's definition of Special Purpose
Shippers to include Florida's new certification process of organic producers. He stated it is crucial in preserving
the integrity of the organic citrus industry. He also expressed support for the regulation's requirement that such
shippers also certify that they will limit organic shipments to organic outlets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order for Florida citrus provides for the establishment of minimum grade and size requirements. The minimum grade
and size requirements are designed to provide fresh markets with fruit of acceptable quality, thereby maintaining
consumer confidence for fresh Florida citrus. This helps create buyer confidence and contributes to stable marketing
conditions. This is in the interest of producers, packers, and consumers, and is designed to increase returns to Florida
citrus growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cultural practices of producers of organically grown citrus differ from normal industry practices. Because
of these differences, organically grown fruit is usually required to meet a different grade standard under the marketing
order. This grade standard pertains only to the external characteristics of the fruit, not the internal quality.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The different grade standard is needed to facilitate the marketing of organic citrus. There are indications that
organically grown citrus, from a marketing standpoint, are a different commodity than conventionally grown citrus.
Organic citrus generally has higher external damage. Organic fruit for the most part is marketed differently, is
not mixed with non-organic fruit, appeals only to certain consumers, and is in many respects, a specialized commodity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule also more precisely defined organic fruit, and the type of market outlets which organically
grown fruit could be sold in, free from certain requirements imposed under the order. These changes were unanimously
recommended by the committee at its November 16, 1993, meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 905.146, 905.147, and 905.148 of the regulations provide terms and conditions under which shippers may
ship organically grown Florida citrus fruit, as Special Purpose Shippers, with a conditional release from certain
grade requirements issued under &sect;905.52 of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the provisions concerning special purpose shipments were made effective in 1978, there were no laws governing
organic fruit and vegetable growers in Florida. A ``Special Purpose Shipper'' was defined under the marketing order
as one who had certified that they would handle only citrus fruit which they knew from their own personal knowledge
was produced on trees on which only compost, non-acidulated fertilizer such as rock phosphate, dolomite, or ground
limestone is used, and to which no chemical insecticide or fungicide had been applied. However, the State of Florida
now requires all organically grown fruits and vegetables to be certified. Accordingly, the committee has recommended
redefining the term ``Special Purpose Shipper'' in &sect;905.146 to mean a person who handles Florida citrus fruit
that is certified by a Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services licensed certifying agent as organically
grown under Florida law. This definition reflects that organic fruit has been certified under Florida law, and also
provides additional assurance that shippers claiming organic status and utilizing the grade standards for organic
fruit qualify to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Florida law, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services licenses independent third parties
to act as certifying agents. Growers who intend to sell organic fruit make an application to a certifying agent. The
certifying agent inspects and certifies a grower's acreage as being in accordance with Florida law and issues the
grower a certificate. The certificate number is transferred to a trip ticket which accompanies any shipments of fruit
grown on the certified acreage. When the handler receives the shipment, a copy of the trip ticket is provided to the
state inspector indicating that the fruit is certified organic and can be packed using the applicable organic grade
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee also recommended that &sect;905.146 be revised to require Special Purpose Shippers to certify that
they will limit their shipments of organically grown citrus fruit to outlets handling organically grown fruits.
The interim final rule replaced the requirement that only outlets registered and approved by the committee could
receive such fruit and ended the requirement that receivers of special purpose shipments complete the applicable
sections of the Report of Special Purpose Shipments form.

The language in &sect;&sect;905.146, 905.147, 905.148 concerning Certificates of Privilege is being revised for
clarity, and procedural safeguards are being added to &sect;905.147(c) dealing with suspensions or denials of Certificates
of Privilege. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the revised exemption provisions
for special purpose shipments, as specified. The Department's view is that this rule may have a beneficial impact
on growers and shippers of organic citrus fruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. chapter 35], the information collection requirements
that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have
been assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0094. This action will reduce the reporting burden on approximately 95 receivers
of special purpose shipments of Florida citrus completing a section of the Report of Special Purpose Shipments form,
taking about .04 hour to complete each report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available
information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the

 This document terminates the Federal marketing orders regulating the handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown
in Arizona and designated parts of California and lemons grown in California and Arizona. The Secretary of Agriculture
has found that these marketing orders no longer tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937. In a press release issued on May 16, 1994, the Department of Agriculture announced the intention
to terminate the orders for California-Arizona navel oranges, Valencia oranges, and lemons, noting the division
and turmoil in the industry and that the programs are not functioning as they should.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This action is governed by the provisions of section 608c(16)(A) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937,
as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Marketing Order Nos. 907 and 908 [7 CFR Parts 907 and 908], as amended, regulate the handling of navel and Valencia oranges
grown in Arizona and designated parts of California. Marketing Order No. 910 [7 CFR Part 910], as amended, regulates
the handling of lemons grown in California and Arizona. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This termination order has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
of the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 140 handlers of navel oranges, 125 handlers of Valencia oranges, and 70 handlers of lemons
who were subject to regulation under the respective marketing orders and there are approximately 3,750 producers
of navel oranges, 3,700 producers of Valencia oranges, and 2,000 producers of lemons in the regulated areas. Small
agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having
annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California-Arizona navel oranges, Valencia oranges,
and lemons may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marketing Order No. 907 has been in effect since 1953, Marketing Order No. 908 since 1954, and Marketing Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 910 since 1958. When order authorities were utilized, the orders provided for the establishment of weekly volume
regulation and size requirements. In addition, the marketing orders authorized marketing research and development
and provided for reporting and recordkeeping requirements for affected handlers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action terminates the provisions of the marketing orders regulating the handling of navel and Valencia oranges
grown in Arizona and designated parts of California and lemons grown in California and Arizona. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 16, 1994, the Deputy Secretary announced in a press release that it was the Department's intention to terminate
the marketing orders for California-Arizona navel oranges, Valencia oranges, and lemons. The decision noted the
division and turmoil in the industry surrounding the California-Arizona citrus orders. The press release stated
that there is a clear indication that the programs are not working as they should. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California-Arizona citrus orders have been marked by industry divisiveness and widespread order violations.
In an effort to reach a satisfactory resolution of industry differences, the Secretary suspended the weekly volume
regulation provisions of the orange orders on June 18, 1993, and invited the industry to submit proposed amendments
to the orders that could achieve the program objectives. After a year, serious differences remain, with no apparent
consensus among the industry. Instead, the orders themselves are contributing to the divisiveness in the industry
and are working to the detriment of growers, packers, and consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the above considerations, pursuant to section 8c(16)(A) of the Act and &sect;907.83, &sect;908.83,
and &sect;910.84 of the respective marketing orders, it is found that 7 CFR Parts 907, 908, and 910 no longer tend to
effectuate the declared policy of the Act, and they are hereby terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8c(16)(A) of the Act requires the Secretary to notify Congress 60 days in advance of the termination of a Federal
marketing order. Congress was so notified on May 16, 1994, and the termination of Marketing Orders Nos. 907, 908, and
910 shall become effective on August 26, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the unanimous recommendations of the Navel Orange Administrative Committee (NOAC), the Valencia Orange
Administrative Committee (VOAC), and the Lemon Administrative Committee (LAC), the Secretary has determined that
Alvin Freisen (VOAC chairperson), and all five members of the joint executive committee for the NOAC and the VOAC,
will serve as trustees for the NOAC and the VOAC and that all six members of the executive committee of the LAC (including
alternates) will serve as trustees for the LAC in order to oversee the administrative affairs of the respective orders.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trustees will be responsible for completing the orders' unfinished business, including ensuring termination
of all outstanding agreements and contracts, and the payment of all obligations. The trustees will be responsible
for safeguarding program assets, holding committee records, and arranging for a financial audit to be conducted.
All such actions by the trustees are subject to the approval of the Secretary. Those designated as trustees for the
NOAC and VOAC are Ms. Darlene V. Ohnemus (VOAC and NOAC member), Mr. Robert O. Bream (NOAC member), Mr. Christopher
R. Frame (NOAC chairperson), Mr. William E. Slattery (VOAC member), Mr. David R. Giller (VOAC member), and Mr. Alvin
Friesen (VOAC chairperson). Those designated as trustees for the LAC are Mr. Solon J. Boydston (LAC member), Ms. Darlene
V. Ohnemus (LAC member), Mr. David R. Giller (LAC member), Mr. Alvin Friesen (LAC member), Mr. Charles R. Bell (LAC
member), and Mr. Christopher R. Frame (LAC member). The trustees shall continue in their capacity until discharged
by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remainder of the reserves, after immediate expenses are paid, will be held by the trustees to be used to cover unforeseen,
outstanding expenses obligated by the committees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest
to give preliminary notice or to engage in further public procedure prior to putting this action into effect and that
good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication because: (1)
Growers and handlers are aware of this action since notice was given to Congress and the termination was announced
in a press release issued by the Secretary on May 16, 1994; (2) this action relieves restrictions on handlers by terminating
the requirements of the marketing orders regulating the handling of California-Arizona navel oranges, Valencia
oranges, and lemons; and (3) no useful purpose would be served by delaying this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without changes, the provisions of the interim
final rule which authorized expenses and established an assessment rate for the Tokay Grape Industry Committee (Committee)
under Marketing Order No. 926 for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget enables the Committee
to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer this program. Funds to administer this program
are derived from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 926 [7 CFR Part 926] regulating the handling of Tokay
grapes grown in San Joaquin County, California. The agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, Tokay grapes grown in California are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate
specified herein will be applicable to all assessable Tokay grapes handled during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year,
beginning April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 3 handlers of Tokay grapes regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately
15 Tokay grape producers in San Joaquin County, California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the
Small Business Administration [13 CFR &sect;121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and
small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Tokay grape marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular
fiscal year apply to all assessable grapes handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are
prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted
to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are grape handlers and producers. They are familiar with
the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus,
all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of grapes. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient
income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee met on April 29, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenditures of $5,150 with an assessment
rate of $0.07 per carton for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. In comparison, the expenditure amount and the assessment
rate are remaining unchanged from the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, estimated at $4,500, will be within the maximum permitted
by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An interim final rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 30872, June 16, 1994] and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the
declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the program began April 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate
of assessment apply to all assessable grapes handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this
action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified

The Oregon, Washington, and California winter pear marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that
the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable winter pears handled from the beginning of
such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration
of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and
producers of Oregon, Washington, and California winter pears. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with
the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate
budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons
have an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of pears. Because this rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient
income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee met on June 3, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $6,835,926 for the 1994&hyph;95
fiscal year. In comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year expense amount was $6,933,615, which is $97,689 more than
the amount recommended for the current fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.43 per standard box, or equivalent for winter
pears. The Committee did not recommend a supplemental assessment rate for Anjou variety pears this fiscal year. In
comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 winter pear assessment rate was $0.45 per standard box, or equivalent and $0.04 for
the supplemental assessment rate on Anjou variety pears. This represents a $0.02 decrease in the assessment rate
recommended for this fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rate, when applied to anticipated winter pear shipments of 13,817,000 boxes or equivalent, will yield a total
of $5,941,310 in assessment income. Assessment income, along with $401,324 from other income sources, and $493,292
from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. The $493,292 withdrawal of
funds from the Committee's authorized reserve will result in no reserve remaining at the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994&hyph;95 fiscal period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major expense categories for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year include $5,572,500 for advertising, $276,340 for SOPP
data research, $276,340 for winter pear improvement, $142,310 for salaries and benefits, and $612,442 for unshared
contingency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal year for the Committee began July 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal year apply to all assessable winter pears handled during the fiscal year; (3) handlers are aware of this
action which was recommended by the Committee at public meetings and which is similar to budgets issued in past years;
and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered
prior to finalization of this action.

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 929 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[7 CFR Part 929], as amended, regulating the handling of cranberries grown in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
New Jersey, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Long Island in the State of New York, hereinafter
referred to as the ``order''. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
[7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, cranberries grown in 10 states are subject to assessments. It is intended that the
assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable cranberries during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal
year beginning September 1, 1994, through August 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local
laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 30 handlers of cranberries grown in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey,
Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Long Island in the State of New York who are subject to regulation
under the cranberry marketing order and approximately 1,050 producers of cranberries in the regulated area. Small
agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual
receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are
less than $5,000,000. The majority of cranberry producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cranberry marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular
fiscal year apply to all assessable cranberries handled from the beginning of such year. The budget of expenses for
the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this
marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers of cranberries.
They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area
and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of cranberries. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will produce
sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The recommended budget and rate of assessment are usually
acted upon by the Committee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore,
the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its expenses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee conducted a mail vote and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 marketing order expenses of $164,690
and an assessment rate of $0.03 per 100-pound barrel of cranberries. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 budgeted expenses
were $155,000, with an approved assessment rate of $0.03 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100-pound barrel of cranberries. This represents an increase of $9,690 in expenses recommended for this fiscal year,
with the assessment rate remaining unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated to total $122,580 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4,086,000 barrels of cranberries. The assessment income, plus $3,750 in interest income and a withdrawal of $38,360
from the Committee's authorized reserve fund will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at
the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year are estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$150,000. The reserve fund will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major expense categories for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year include $70,110 for operating expenses, $40,500 for travel
expenses, and $33,241 for administrative expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available
information, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule establishing interim final and final free and restricted percentages for domestic inshell filberts/hazelnuts
for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year under the Federal marketing order for filberts/hazelnuts grown in Oregon and
Washington. The percentages allocate the amounts of domestically produced filberts/hazelnuts which may be marketed
in domestic, export and other outlets. The percentages are intended to stabilize the supply of domestic inshell filberts/hazelnuts
in order to meet the limited domestic demand for such filberts/hazelnuts and provide reasonable returns to producers.
This rule was recommended by the Filbert/Hazelnut Marketing Board (Board), which is the agency responsible for local
administration of the order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 982 [7 CFR Part 982], both as amended, regulating
the handling of filberts/hazelnuts grown in Oregon and Washington. This order is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is intended that this action apply
to all merchantable filberts/hazelnuts handled during the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year. This rule will not preempt
any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 1,000 producers of filberts/hazelnuts in the production area and approximately 25 handlers
subject to regulation under the marketing order. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business
Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service
firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of handlers and producers
of filberts/hazelnuts may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board's recommendation and this rule are based on requirements specified in the order. This rule finalizes an
interim final rule which established the amount of inshell filberts/hazelnuts that can be marketed in domestic markets.
The domestic outlets for this commodity are characterized by limited demand, and interim final and final free and
restricted percentages benefit the industry by promoting stronger marketing conditions and stabilizing prices
and supplies, thus improving grower returns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule was issued on February 18, 1994, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 9068, February 25, 1994], with an effective date of February 25, 1994. That rule added &sect;982.242 to the rules
and regulations in effect under the order. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended March 28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment was received, from the United States Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel for Advocacy (SBA).
The SBA's comment alleged that the Department should have undertaken an analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act and should have sought public comment prior to placing the interim rule in effect. The comment by SBA fails to consider
the distinct characteristics of the filbert program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this marketing order, there are permanent regulations that authorize a market allocation program for filberts
and that specify exactly how the free and restricted percentages should be established and revised. Those provisions
were adopted after a formal rulemaking hearing, a process that allows for a full presentation of all economic and operational
evidence not only in written form, but also through oral testimony under oath and subject to cross-examination. The
process additionally permits further briefing and exceptions based on this record of exhibits and testimony. Hence,
there has been extensive economic analysis and public participation in the rulemaking adopting the market allocation
program and specifying the market allocation calculation procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each year the marketing order Board meets and considers a marketing policy for the coming year, including the activation
of the market allocation program and the projected trade demand (as calculated under the specifications in the permanent
regulations). The Board represents the entire filbert industry and brings to its deliberations the highest level
of experience and expertise. The Board conducts open meetings and receives input of an economic nature from all interested
persons. The Secretary's representatives are in attendance at such meetings and freely interact to gather any necessary
economic or operational information. In addition, the Board is continually gathering economic data from a number
of sources for its deliberations and for submission to the Secretary. At several points during the season, the Board
holds further open meetings to update or revise the market allocation program for the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of this unique and comprehensive system, the Department believes it is sufficiently knowledgeable to make
a Regulatory Flexibility Act certification without any further studies or reports. In addition, there has been ample
opportunity for public participation both in the formal rulemaking process that created the detailed market allocation
program formula being applied herein, as well as thereafter to assure the Secretary that there has been no misapplication.
Finally, it should be noted that the specific action commented-on is an interim rule which relieved restrictions
by releasing the full free percentage immediately on February 25 rather than waiting until late May as may be provided
under the order. This relaxation was effectuated only 10 days after the last date for marketing policy revisions and
seeking further prior public participation would have significantly temporally diluted the value of this relief
to the industry. Hence, the alternative championed by SBA would have maintained for a longer time more restrictive
trade controls on small handlers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, for the reasons stated, the above comment in opposition to the interim final rule is denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is required to meet prior to September 20 of each marketing year to compute an inshell trade demand and preliminary
free and restricted percentages, if the use of volume regulation is recommended during the season. The order prescribes
formulas for computing the inshell trade demand, as well as preliminary, interim final, and final percentages. The
inshell trade demand establishes the amount of inshell filberts/hazelnuts the market can utilize throughout the
season, and the percentages release the volume of filberts/hazelnuts necessary to meet the inshell trade demand.
The preliminary percentages provide for the release of 80 percent of the inshell trade demand. The interim final percentages
release 100 percent of the inshell trade demand. The inshell trade demand equals the average of the preceding three
``normal'' years' trade acquisitions of inshell filberts/hazelnuts, rounded to the nearest whole number. The Board
may increase such estimate by no more than 25 percent, if market conditions warrant an increase. The final free and
restricted percentages release an additional 15 percent of the average of the preceding three years' trade acquisitions
of inshell filberts/hazelnuts for desirable carryout. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preliminary free and restricted percentages make available portions of the filbert/hazelnut crop which may
be marketed in domestic inshell markets (free) and exported, shelled, or otherwise disposed of (restricted) early
in the 1993&hyph;94 season. The preliminary free percentage is expressed as a percentage of the total supply subject
to regulation and is based on preliminary crop estimates. The majority of domestic inshell filberts/hazelnuts are
marketed in October, November, and December. By November, the marketing season is well under way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its August 26, 1993, meeting, the Board announced preliminary free and restricted percentages of 7 percent and
93 percent, respectively, to release 80 percent of the inshell trade demand. The purpose of releasing only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
80 percent of the inshell trade demand under the preliminary percentage is to guard against underestimates of crop
size. The preliminary restricted percentage is 100 percent minus the free percentage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On or before November 15, the Board must meet again to recommend interim final percentages and final percentages.
The Board uses current crop estimates to calculate the interim final and final percentages. The interim final percentages
are calculated in the same way as the preliminary percentages and release 100 percent of the inshell trade demand previously
computed by the Board for the marketing year. Final free and restricted percentages release an additional 15 percent
of the average of the preceding three years' trade acquisitions to ensure an adequate carryover into the following
season. The final free and restricted percentages must be effective at least 30 days prior to the end of the marketing
year (July 1 through June 30), or earlier, if recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary. In addition, revisions
in the marketing policy can be made until February 15 of each marketing year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with order provisions, the Board met on November 10, 1993, reviewed and approved an amended marketing
policy and recommended the establishment of interim final and final free and restricted percentages. Interim final
percentages were recommended at 12 percent free and 88 percent restricted, and final free and restricted percentages
were recommended at 13 percent and 87 percent. The interim final percentages made an additional 807 tons of product
available for the domestic inshell market. The interim final marketing percentages were based on the industry's
final production estimates and released 3,903 tons to the domestic inshell market from the 1993 crop. The final marketing
percentages released an additional 605 tons from the 1993 crop for domestic use. Thus, a total of 4,508 tons of product
was available from the 1993 crop for domestic use when the final percentages were established. The Oregon Agricultural
Statistics Service provided an early estimate of 39,000 tons total production for the Oregon and Washington area.
However, a handler survey conducted by the Board provided a more current estimate of 37,700 tons total production
for the area. Therefore, the Board voted to unanimously accept the more current estimate of 37,700 tons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the crop is large, the Board determined that the inshell domestic market conditions would allow more product
without depressing the market and recommended immediate release of the additional 15 percent (the final percentages).
The Board believed that the immediate release of the final percentages would benefit the industry with increased
returns to growers and more product available for consumers.

The marketing policy of the marketing order states that the final percentages must be effective at least 30 days prior
to the end of the marketing year, or earlier. The Board recommended immediate release of the final percentages, in
accordance with the authority of the marketing policy. The marketing policy also requires that procedurally, the
Board recommend interim final and final percentages. Therefore, the interim final percentages were established
even though they would not be utilized this marketing season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The marketing percentages were based on the Board's production estimates and the following supply and demand information
for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year:

In addition to complying with the provisions of the marketing order, the Board also considers the Department's 1982
``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders'' (Guidelines) when making its computations
in the marketing policy. This volume control regulation provides a method to collectively limit the supply of inshell
filberts/hazelnuts available for sale in domestic markets. The Guidelines provide that this primary market have
available a quantity equal to 110 percent of recent years' sales in those outlets before secondary market allocations
are approved. This provides for plentiful supplies for consumers and for market expansion while retaining the mechanism
for dealing with oversupply situations. An additional increase of 20 percent (807 tons) was included in the calculations
used in determining the inshell trade demand. The established final percentages make available 4,508 tons from the
1993 crop plus 937 tons of declared carryin which is 135 percent of prior years' sales, thus exceeding the goal of the
Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the Board,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule increases the quantity of ``Class 3'' (Native) spearmint oil produced in the Far West that
handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year. This rule was recommended
by the Spearmint Oil Administrative Committee (Committee), the agency responsible for local administration of
the marketing order for spearmint oil produced in the Far West. The Committee recommended this rule to avoid extreme
fluctuations in supplies and prices and thus help to maintain stability in the Far West spearmint oil market.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 985 [7 CFR Part 985], regulating the handling of spearmint oil produced
in the Far West (Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and designated parts of California, Nevada, Montana, and Utah), hereinafter
referred to as the ``order.'' This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
[7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing
order now in effect, salable quantities and allotment percentages may be established for classes of spearmint oil
produced in the Far West. This rule increases the quantity of Class 3 spearmint oil produced in the Far West that may
be purchased from or handled for producers by handlers during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year, which ends on May 31,
1995. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are eight spearmint oil handlers subject to regulation under the order and approximately 260 producers of spearmint
oil in the regulated production area. Of the 260 producers, approximately 145 producers hold ``Class 3'' (Native)
spearmint oil allotment base, and approximately 160 producers hold ``Class 1'' (Scotch) spearmint oil allotment
base. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as
those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of handlers and producers of Far West spearmint oil may be classified
as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Far West spearmint oil industry is characterized by producers whose farming operations generally involve more
than one commodity and whose income from farming operations are not exclusively dependent on the production of spearmint
oil. The U.S. production of spearmint oil is concentrated in the Far West, primarily Washington, Idaho, and Oregon
(part of the area covered by the order). Spearmint oil is also produced in the Midwest. The production area covered
by the order normally accounts for 75 percent of the annual U.S. production of spearmint oil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule increases the quantity of Native spearmint oil that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers
during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year, which ends on May 31, 1995. This rule increases the salable quantity from
897,388 pounds to 1,092,577 pounds and the allotment percentage from 46 percent to 56 percent for Native spearmint
oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The salable quantity is the total quantity of each class of oil that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers
during a marketing year. The salable quantity calculated by the Committee is based on the estimated trade. The total
salable quantity is divided by the total industry allotment base to determine an allotment percentage. Each producer
is allotted a share of the salable quantity by applying the allotment percentage to the producer's allotment base
for the applicable class of spearmint oil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial salable quantity and allotment percentages for both Native and Scotch spearmint oils for the 1994&hyph;95
marketing year were recommended by the Committee at its October 6, 1993, meeting. For both Native and Scotch spearmint
oils, the Committee recommended salable quantities of 897,388 pounds and 723,326 pounds, and allotment percentages
of 46 percent and 41 percent, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule incorporating the Committee's October 6, 1993, recommendation was published in the December 21,
1993, issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [58 FR 67378]. Comments on the proposed rule were solicited from interested persons until January 20, 1994. No comments
were received. Accordingly, based upon analysis of available information, a final rule establishing the Committee's
recommendation as the salable quantities and allotment percentages for both Native and Scotch spearmint oils for
the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year was published in the March 16, 1994, issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 12151]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to authority contained in sections 985.50, 985.51, and 985.52 of the order, the Committee unanimously recommended
at its June 14, 1994, teleconference meeting that the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint
oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year be increased. The Committee recommended that the Native spearmint oil salable
quantity be increased from 897,388 pounds to 1,092,577 pounds. Based on a revised total allotment base of 1,951,032
pounds, the allotment percentage is increased from 46 to 56 percent which results in a 195,189 pound increase in the
salable quantity.

In making this recommendation the Committee considered all available information on supply and demand. As of June
14, 1994, the Committee reports that of the 1994&hyph;95 Native spearmint oil salable quantity of 897,388 pounds,
78,787 pounds remained available for handling. Handlers have indicated, however, that demand may approximate 200,000
pounds of Native spearmint oil for the remainder of this marketing year. This level of demand was not anticipated by
the Committee when it made its initial recommendation for the establishment of a salable quantity and allotment percentage
for Native spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recommended salable quantity of 1,092,577 pounds of Native spearmint oil (an increase of 195,189 pounds), combined
with the actual June 1, 1994, carry-in of 21,125 pounds, results in a revised 1994&hyph;95 available supply of 1,113,702
pounds. This available supply is approximately 30,000 pounds higher than the annual average of sales for the past
five years. The Committee anticipates that foreseeable demand will be adequately met with the recommended increase.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee did not recommend an increase in the available supply of Scotch spearmint oil since it is anticipated
that there will be a surplus supply of this type of oil by the end of the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department, based on its analysis of available information, has determined that an allotment percentage of 56
percent should be established for Native spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year. This percentage will
provide an increased salable quantity of 1,092,577 pounds of Native spearmint oil.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including that contained in the prior proposed and final rules
in connection with the establishment of the salable quantities and allotment percentages for Native and Scotch spearmint
oils for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year, the Committee's recommendation and other available information, it is
found that to revise section 985.213 [59 FR 12151] to change the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native
spearmint oil, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists
for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) This interim final rule increases the quantity of Native spearmint oil that may be marketed immediately;
(2) Handlers and producers should be apprised as soon as possible of the salable quantity and allotment percentage
of Native spearmint oil contained in this interim final rule; and (3) This rule provides a 30-day comment period and
any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule revises the administrative rules and regulations established under the Federal marketing order
for raisins produced from grapes grown in California. It removes a provision that currently exempts raisins produced
from grapes dried on the vine in southern California and exported to Mexico from all marketing order requirements.
This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee), which is responsible
for local administration of the order. Elimination of the exemption will facilitate administration and improve
enforcement efforts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 [7 CFR Part 989], both as amended, regulating
the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended, [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This action will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing
order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of producers
and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule removes a provision that exempts raisins produced from grapes dried on the vine in southern California
and exported to Mexico in natural condition from all marketing order requirements. It is based on a unanimous recommendation
of the Committee and other available information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 989.60 of the order provides that the Committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, rules and
procedures to exempt from regulations raisins produced in southern California (i.e., the counties of Riverside,
Imperial, San Bernardino, Ventura, Orange, Los Angeles, and San Diego) and disposed of for distillation, livestock
feed, or by export in natural condition to Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of section 989.160 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations (7 CFR 989.102&hyph;989.176)
currently exempts raisins produced from grapes dried on the vine in those southern California counties, which are
disposed of for use in distillation, livestock feed, or by export in natural condition to Mexico, from all marketing
order requirements. This final rule eliminates the exemption that applies to those raisins exported in natural condition
to Mexico.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When that exemption provision was established in the early 1970's, the quantities of raisins exported to Mexico were
relatively small and were of off-grade quality. It was determined at that time that the export exemption would not
interfere with order regulations or with accomplishing program objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Diminished demand in recent years for off-grade raisins and raisin residual material for distillation in California
has made export in natural condition to Mexico a relatively lucrative market. The Committee has confirmed reports
that large volumes of poor quality raisins, including lots as large as forty to fifty thousand pounds, have been exported
into Mexico from southern California and other areas of California. This is a significant departure from the situation
which existed when the exemption was first implemented. Raisins from areas which are not exempt from the provisions
of the order appear to be passing into Mexico in violation of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has effected the removal of import duties and license requirements,
opening the Mexican market to raisins which meet the quality requirements of the order. Hence, there is now an opportunity
to build an export market in Mexico for high quality raisins. The Committee believes that all raisins eligible for
export to Mexico need to be subject to the quality requirements of the order. The Committee also believes that the regulation
of such raisins is essential to meeting program objectives and improving compliance efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of this information, the Committee, on April 16, 1994, unanimously recommended the removal of the exemption
that applies to raisins produced from grapes dried on the vine in southern California and exported in natural condition
to Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of this action was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 15, 1994 [59 FR 36093]. The proposed rule provided a 15-day comment period which ended August 1, 1994. No comments
were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's unanimous recommendation
and other information, it is found that the issuance of this final rule, will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date
of this final rule until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) The 1994&hyph;95 crop year began August 1, 1994, and the final rule should cover as much of the crop year
as possible to accomplish program objectives and improve compliance efforts; (2) handlers are aware of this action
which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting; and (3) the proposed rule provided a 15-day
comment period, and no comments were received.

This document temporarily revises the supply plant shipping standards under the Chicago Regional order for the month
of September 1994. Shipping percentages for individual supply plants and units of supply plants are reduced to 1 percent
and 4 percent, respectively, for the month of September. The action is necessary to prevent uneconomic and inefficient
movements of milk to qualify plants for pooling. A proposed reduction for the month of August was found to be not necessary.

Notice of Proposed Temporary Revision: Issued July 11, 1994; published July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36094).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens
the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to
have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revision is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions
of &sect;1030.7(b)(5) of the Chicago Regional milk order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 36094) concerning a proposed temporary relaxation of the supply plant shipping percentages under the Chicago
Regional milk order. The revisions were proposed to be effective for the months of August and September 1994. The public
was afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed notice by submitting written data, views and arguments by
July 22, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments supporting the proposed revision for the month of September were received. The comments agreed that
the degree of adjustment that the order allows the market administrator to make in supply plant shipping requirements
would be sufficient for the month of August. No opposing comments were received.

Statement of Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the month of September 1994 this rule revises from 5 percent to 1 percent the requirements of the Chicago Regional
order that pool supply plants ship to distributing plants a minimum percentage of receipts. For a unit of supply plants,
the action reduces the required shipping percentage from 10 percent of the supply plants' receipts to 4 percent. A
proposed revision for the month of August is found to be unnecessary because the order authorizes the market administrator
to reduce the supply plant shipping percentages to a great enough degree to meet current market needs. The degree to
which the market administrator is authorized to revise shipping requirements is, however, not great enough to meet
the needs of the market for September.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The temporary revision was requested by Central Milk Producers Cooperative (CMPC), a federation of cooperative
associations that represent a substantial number of the producers who supply the market. CMPC contends that a reduction
of the shipping percentages is necessary to prevent uneconomic shipments of milk from distant supply plants solely
for pooling purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CMPC originally requested that the required supply plant shipping percentages be eliminated for September for both
individual supply plants and supply plant units. After having the opportunity to see data for further months, however,
the cooperative federation stated that the revision originally requested would be excessive in view of recent increases
in production over the volume CMPC had projected and recent increased demand for milk for manufacturing uses. CMPC
therefore recommended that the proposed reduction be modified to establish shipping standards of 1 percent for individual
supply plants and 4 percent for units. Dean Foods, a large fluid milk handler regulated under the Chicago Regional
order, supported CMPC's request for September.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the supply/demand relationship for the market the supply plant shipping percentages should be reduced
for September 1994. A reduction of the shipping percentages will contribute to orderly marketing in that costly and
inefficient shipments of milk from distant supply plants will not be necessary. Thus, dairy farmers who have supplied
the market will continue to have their milk pooled under the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision needed for September is greater than the market administrator is authorized to accomplish under the
order. Therefore, it must be effectuated by the Director of the Dairy Division.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal set forth in the aforesaid notice, and other
available information, it is hereby found and determined that the pool supply plant shipping percentage set forth
in &sect;1030.7(b) should be reduced for the month of September to 1 percent of individual supply plant receipts and
4 percent of supply plant unit receipts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby found and determined that 30 days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest in that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) This revision is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to maintain orderly marketing conditions
in the marketing area for the month of September;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) This revision does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective
date; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Notice of the proposed revision was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written
data, views, or arguments concerning this revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments supporting the proposed revision were received, with no comments opposing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, good cause exists for making this revision effective less than 30 days from the date of publication in the

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is adopting without modification an interim final rule amending the Cotton
Board Rules and Regulations to allow for the continuation of collections on renumbered imported cotton-containing
products as long as no change in the product's Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) description occurs. Since renumbering
of products by the U.S. Customs Service occurs rather frequently, providing for a continuation of assessment collection
will prevent unnecessary and costly interruptions of the program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore has not been
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file
suit in court. Under Section 12 of the Act, any person subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating
that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance
with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such person is afforded the opportunity
for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the
District Court of the United States in any district in which the person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place
of business, has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling, provided a complaint is filed within 20 days from
the date of the entry or the ruling.

There are an estimated 10,000 importers who are presently subject to rules and regulations issued pursuant to the
Cotton Research and Promotion Order 7 U.S.C. 2101&hyph;2118. This rule will affect importers of cotton and products
containing cotton. The majority of these importers are small businesses under the criteria established by the Small
Business Administration. This rule will help ensure the uninterrupted collection of assessments on products already
subject to assessment.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In July of 1992, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) finalized rules and regulations for the authority to collect
assessments on cotton and cotton-containing products as authorized in the 1990 Farm Bill. In order to designate specific
imported products subject to assessment, AMS published, within the implementing regulations, a table of approximately
700 HTS numbers and individual assessment rates for each. Collections began on August 1, 1992. Soon after, the Department
of Commerce changed certain HTS numbers that USDA had identified as subject to the assessment. During the first 17
months of import assessments, AMS has found that the Department of Commerce may revise HTS numbers as a result of presidential
proclamation, congressional actions, statistical tracking requirements, etc. Often, these changed numbers are
merely replacements of previous numbers and have no impact on the physical properties, description or cotton content
of the product it represents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Customs Service informed USDA prior to the publishing of this rule that several HTS numbers listed in the Import
Assessment Table contained in 7 CFR 1205.510 would no longer be valid as of January 1, 1994, because of recent statistical
changes made by the Department of Commerce. These statistical changes to the HTS numbers were made for reasons associated
with the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to collect cotton research and promotion assessments on imported products containing cotton, HTS numbers
listed in the Assessment Table in 7 CFR 1205.510 must correspond to numbers listed in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule.
USDA has found that frequent rulemaking is necessary in order to maintain an up-to-date list of HTS numbers in the regulations
which provide the U.S. Customs Service the authority to collect cotton research and promotion assessments on imported
cotton and products containing cotton. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes made to HTS numbers during calendar year 1993 have resulted in reduced collections by U.S. Customs under the
import assessment program averaging over $30,000 per month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA has reason to believe that changes in HTS numbering and the resulting impact on the Cotton Research and Promotion
Program will continue. U.S. international trade agreements such as NAFTA, GATT, and changes in most favored nation
trading status for certain textile producing countries will, according to the U.S. Customs Service, generate changes
in HTS headings on a continuing basis. The Cotton Research and Promotion Program would in this environment experience
an unpredictable loss of revenue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the number and frequency of HTS number changes USDA expects, updating the list of HTS numbers through rulemaking
is an impractical solution to minimizing interruptions in assessment collections. Therefore, this rule provides
for the continued collection of assessments when HTS numbers are changed so long as such changes have no impact on the
physical properties, description, or cotton content of the products involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that Commerce does renumber HTS headings where an actual change in the product occurs. This
rule would not address this type of renumbering. USDA will continue to suspend assessments in these situations until
the cotton content and a revised assessment rate could be determined and the assessment table revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on discussions with importers and U.S. Customs Service officials, USDA has determined that the import community
supports continuing to pay assessments on products when numbers have changed but the product remains the same. In
fact, suspending collections on HTS headings that undergo mere renumbering is causing confusion for importers and
Customs. Customs officials have informed USDA that they can program their automated computer collection system
to continue collecting assessments when HTS headings undergo renumbering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 1, 1994, at 59 FR 33901, AMS published an interim final rule amending 7 CFR Part 1205 to allow for the continuation
of collections on renumbered imported cotton-containing products as long as no change in the product's Harmonized
Tariff Schedule (HTS) description occurs. The rule was published with a request for comments to be submitted by August
1, 1994. AMS received no comments pertaining to the interim final during the specified comment period. Therefore,
this rule adopts the interim final rule without change.

 This interim final rule is issued under the Potato Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) [7 CFR Part 1207]. The Plan is
authorized by the Potato Research and Promotion Act, as amended [7 U.S.C. 2611&hyph;2627], hereinafter referred
to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempt from Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
311 of the Act, a person subject to a plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such plan, any provision
of such plan or any obligation imposed in connection with such plan is not in accordance with law; and requesting a modification
of the plan or an exemption from the plan. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States
in any district in which such person is an inhabitant, or has principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided that a complaint is filed within 20 days after the date of entry of
the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are an estimated 2,000 handlers, 6,000 producers, 80 importers of potatoes and potato products for human consumption,
and 25 importers of seed potatoes who are subject to the provisions of the Plan. The majority of these persons may be
classified as small agricultural producers and small agricultural service firms. Small agricultural producers
are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5 million. The majority
of potato handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Potato Promotion Board (Board) administers a national program of research, development, advertising,
and promotion designed to strengthen potatoes' competitive position and to maintain and expand domestic and foreign
markets for potatoes and potato products. The program is financed by assessments on producers of 5 or more acres of
potatoes (collected by the first handler) and on all imported fresh or processed potatoes for human consumption and
seed potatoes (collected by the U.S. Customs Service). There are currently 103 members on the Board: 100 producers,
2 importers, and a public member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the large size of the Board, the Plan authorizes the Board to appoint an Administrative Committee which has the
authority to conduct Board business on the Board's behalf. As currently set forth in paragraph (a) of section 1207.507
of the rules and regulations issued under the Plan, the Board is authorized to appoint up to 27 members to the Administrative
Committee which includes 25 producer members, 1 importer member, and the public member. Producer membership on the
Administrative Committee is allocated among six regions established in the Board's bylaws on the percentage of U.S.
potato production in each region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the six regions were established in 1972, potato production in the U.S. has increased and shifted to the extent
that the number of producer members in each region is no longer representative of the percentage of production in each
region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its March 20, 1993, annual meeting, the Board directed its Long-Range Planning Subcommittee to study the increase
and shifts in potato production to determine whether or not producer member allocation by region was equitable and
to recommend corrective action the following year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using data from the Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistical Service, the subcommittee determined
that, based on the percentage of U.S. potato production, some regions were under-represented and other regions were
over-represented on the Administrative Committee. The subcommittee also determined that if the 25 producer members
on the Administrative Committee were apportioned based on current production, some regions would lose representation
disproportionately to the decrease in production in that region. Therefore, at the Administrative Committee's
January 12, 1994, meeting, the subcommittee presented to the Administrative Committee four proposals for the Administrative
Committee's consideration. The Administrative Committee approved a proposal to add 5 producer members to the Administrative
Committee and to reallocate the 30 producer members to reflect, as closely as possible, the percentage of U.S. potato
production in each region. The proposal approved by the Administrative Committee for presentation to the full Board
would increase the total number of Administrative Committee members from 27 to 32 (30 producer members, 1 importer
member, and the public member) and would reallocate the 30 producer members among the regions as follows: Northwest,
from 8 members to 13; North Central, from 5 members to 6; Northeast, from 5 members to 4; Southwest, from 3 members to
2; South Central, from 2 members to 3; and Southeast, 2 members (no change). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This recommendation was presented to and approved by the full Board at the Board's annual meeting on March 18, 1994.
The Board approved an amendment to Article VI, Section 1 of the Board's bylaws, which sets forth the allocation of Administrative
Committee members, and recommended amending paragraph (a) of section 1207.507 of the Plan's rules and regulations,
which sets forth the number of members and composition of the Administrative Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Board, with the Secretary's concurrence, may amend its bylaws to reflect changes to the regional boundaries
and allocation of the producer members, paragraph (a) of section 1207.507 of the rules and regulations issued under
the Plan must be amended to change the number of Board members who may serve on the Administrative Committee. However,
U.S. potato production and the distribution of that production among the states is subject to future change which
would affect producer representation on the Administrative Committee. Therefore, in order to provide more flexibility
to the Board in adjusting the size of its Administrative Committee based on current production trends and, at the same
time, eliminate unnecessary rulemaking, this rule amends paragraph (a) of section 1207.507 to provide that the number
of producer members on the Administrative Committee be as set forth in the Board's bylaws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action also revises section 1207.501 of the rules and regulations to reflect the Board's current place of business.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Committee for Statistical Annotation of Tariff Schedules of the International Trade Commission,
at the request of the Department, has revised the statistical reporting requirements for imported potato starch.
As a result, Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) code numbers which differentiate between imported potato starch for
human consumption and imported potato starch for other uses have been established. Paragraph (b)(3) of section 1207.510
provides the HTS categories and assessment rates on imported tablestock potatoes and frozen or processed potatoes
for ultimate consumption by humans and on imported seed potatoes. The Act provides the authority for the Board to assess
only those potatoes and potato products intended for human consumption and for use as seed. Because the tariff schedule
did not provide a statistical breakout to identify product intended for different uses, the present HTS code number
in this section identifying potato starch does not differentiate between the above uses. As a result, it is possible
that assessments on potato starch not intended for human consumption are being collected by the U.S. Customs Service
on the Board's behalf. Amending this section to list the correct HTS code for potato starch for human consumption will
eliminate the need for importers to request a refund from the Board of assessments that might be erroneously collected
by Customs on the Board's behalf. Therefore, this rule also amends paragraph (b)(3) of section 1207.510 to reflect
the new HTS code number identifying potato starch for human consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this rule would not have a significant
economic effect on a substantial number of small entities.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The air quality planning and State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport
areas are set out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 (CAA or ``the Act''). EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA
intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone
transport areas within the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation
of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''),
and 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Supplement to the General Preamble'')). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed
in this document, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The
Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify part 40 of the CFR to reflect the requirements of the emission
statement program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out
requirements applicable in Marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable in subsections (b), (c),
(d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program in paragraph
(3) of that subsection for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the State each year emission statements showing
actual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This paragraph provides that the States are to submit a revision to their SIPs by November 15, 1992, establishing
this emission statement program. Whatever minimum reporting level is established in a State emission statement
program, if either VOC or NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is emitted at or above the designated level, the other pollutant should be included in the emission statement, even
if it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA requires facilities to submit the first emission statement to the State within three years after November
15, 1990, and annually thereafter. EPA requests that the States submit the emission data to EPA through the Aerometric
Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The minimum emission statement data should include: Certification of data
accuracy; source identification information; operating schedule; emissions information (to include annual and
typical ozone season day emissions); control equipment information; and process data. EPA developed emission statements
data elements to be consistent with other source and State reporting requirements. This consistency is essential
to assist States with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all EPA reporting
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the submission of the emission statement data to AIRS, States should provide EPA with a status report
that outlines the degree of compliance with the emissions statement program. Beginning July 1, 1993, States should
report quarterly to EPA the total number of sources affected by the emission statement provisions, the number that
have complied with the provisions, and the number that have not. This status report should also include the total annual

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Procedural Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing its SIP, of which the emission statement
program will become a part. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State
must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(l) similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the CAAA
must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Also section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions
of section 110(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA must at the outset determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action
(see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within
60 days of receiving a submission. However, under section 110(k)(1)(B), a submittal is deemed complete by operation
of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA 6 months after receipt of the submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State passed the revisions to the TACB General Rules, 101, by repealing the existing section 101.10 and replacing
it with a new section 101.10 on August 20, 1992. The State submitted the revision to public hearing on April 19, 1992.
The rule was submitted to EPA on October 15, 1992, by the Governor, as a proposed revision to the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 15, 1992, SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance
with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991).
The submittal was found to be complete and a letter dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 15, 1993, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to
be taken in the review process. The provisions of the regulations are outlined under the analysis of the State's submission
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 1, 1993, the TACB merged with the Texas Water Commission to form the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission (TNRCC) and is now called the Office of Air Quality within the TNRCC. The merger did not abrogate, void,
or rescind any rules, regulations, Orders, permits, or any other action previously taken by the former TACB.

2. Components of Emission Statement Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the State must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for
reporting by the sources and the State. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability,
definitions, compliance, and specific source requirements detailed below.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. SIP Revision Submission. Required within 2 years of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) (November
15, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Program Elements. The State emission statement program must, at a minimum, include provisions covering applicability
of the regulations, definitions for key terms used in the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered
by the regulations, and the specific reporting requirements for sources. The emission statement submitted by the
source should contain, at a minimum, a certification that the information is accurate to the best knowledge of the
individual certifying the statement, source identification information, operating information, process rate
data, control equipment information, and emissions information. These elements are described in greater detail
in section D of this document. EPA recommends that the State program require the submission of the data from the sources
no later than April 15 of each year to insure that the State can meet the July 1 deadline for the submission of data into
AIRS each year. The guidance document prepared by EPA provides a draft model State rule which can be used as the basis
for the States to develop their program. The guidance document also provides suggested language for the specific
program elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Sources Covered. Section 182(a)(3)(B) requires that States with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone
require emission statement data from sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) or oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in the nonattainment areas. This requirement applies to all ozone nonattainment areas, regardless of the classification
(Marginal, Moderate, etc.). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The States may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for emission statements for classes or categories of sources
with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories
and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP&hyph;42)
or other methods acceptable to EPA. States should get clearance from the appropriate EPA Regional Office to waive
the emission statement requirement for these smaller sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Reporting Requirements for Sources. The State of Texas requires facilities to report on an emissions inventory
questionnaire supplied by the State. Sources covered by the State emission statement program should submit, at a
minimum, the following data elements:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Review of the State's Emission Statement Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Applicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicability of the regulation to ozone nonattainment areas is documented in subsection (a) and (a)(1). The
rule states that the owner or operator of the following stationary sources in the State of Texas or on waters that extend
25 miles from the shoreline shall submit emissions inventories to the Texas Air Control Board (TACB) on forms or other
media approved by the TACB: a major facility/stationary source, as defined in Section 101.1 of this title (relating
to definitions), and any stationary source in an ozone nonattainment area emitting a minimum of 10 tons per year (tpy)
volatile organic compounds (VOC), 25 tpy nitrogen oxides (NOx), or 100 tpy carbon monoxide (CO). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Types of Inventories
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are two types of inventories identified in the regulation which are pertinent to emission statements. They
are an initial emissions inventory and an ozone nonattainment area inventory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement for initial emissions inventories is documented in subsection (b)(1). Stationary sources, as identified
in subsection (a) of Section 101.10 shall submit an initial emissions inventory (IEI) for any criteria pollutant
or hazardous air pollutant that has not been identified in a previous inventory. The IEI shall consist of actual emissions
of VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, CO, sulfur dioxide (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), lead (Pb), and particulate matter of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) from stationary sources and emissions of all hazardous air pollutants identified in the FCAA, Section 112(b). For
purposes of this section, the term ``actual emission'' is the actual rate of emissions of a pollutant from an emissions
unit for the calendar year or seasonal period. Actual emission estimates must also include excess emissions occurring
during maintenance, start-ups, shut-downs, upsets, and downtime to parallel the documentation of these events
in the emissions inventory and must follow emissions calculations identified in subsection (c) of section 101.10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement for ozone nonattainment areas inventories is documented in subsection (b)(3). This subsection
requires stationary sources in ozone nonattainment areas emitting a minimum of 10 TPY of VOC, 25 TPY of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or 100 TPY of CO to submit an annual inventory. The inventory shall consist of actual annual emissions and typical
weekday emissions that occur during the summer months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Minimum Data Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The data requirements include a certifying statement, facility identification information, operating information,
process rate data, control equipment information, and emissions information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certifying statement is documented in subsection (d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A statement is required from the owner or operator to accompany the emission inventory certifying that the information
is true and accurate to the best knowledge of the certifying official. The certification will include the name, title,
signature, date of signature, and telephone number of the certifying official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data requirements are contained in the questionnaire used by the State to gather emission statement data. The
questionnaire is required from all facilities which must report emission statement data. A copy of the questionnaire
and instructions for completion is contained in the Technical Support Document (TSD). Source data elements required
by Texas through the questionnaire sent by the State to the facilities are:

D. Calculations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculations of emissions are documented in subsection (c). The subsection specifies that actual measurement with
continuous monitoring systems (CEMS) is the preferred method of calculating emissions from a point source. Other
means of determining actual emissions may be utilized if CEMS data is not available in accordance with detailed instructions
from the Emissions Inventory Division of the TACB.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reporting requirements are documented in subsection (e). The reporting deadline for the 1992 ozone nonattainment
area is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 31, 1993. Subsequent emission statements are due on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 31 of each year and will contain data for the previous year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Enforcement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The enforcement requirements are documented in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsection (f). The State of Texas has included language in its regulation that permits the State to enforce the provisions
of the regulation under all pertinent State enforcement authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA. The EPA criteria addressing the
enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541 (April 16, 1992) (``Review
of State Implementation Plans and Revisions for Enforceability and Legal Sufficiency'')). SIP provisions must
also contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section
110(a)(2)(C)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis of the Texas regulation shows that it adequately addresses all components of an emission statement program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the State has agreed to provide the EPA with emission statement data for the EPA AIRS through the State
grants process and to provide quarterly status reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's action, the EPA is granting final approval of the Texas emission statement program as submitted. The EPA
is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and
anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this FR publication, the EPA is proposing to approve
the SIP revision should adverse comments be received. Thus, this action will be effective October 25, 1994 unless,
by September 26, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document
which will withdraw the final action. All public comments will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on
this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties
interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no comments are received, the public is advised
that this action will be effective October 25, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments of November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing.
Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have
a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship
under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic
reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 25, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time
within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action.
This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 8, 1994, (59 FR 35044) the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approved a revision to the
Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. The action approved a request by Indiana to redesignate the following
ozone nonattainment areas: St. Joseph and Elkhart, Vanderburgh, and Marion Counties to attainment of the National
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone. The USEPA also approved the State's maintenance plan for these counties.
The USEPA is withdrawing this final rule due to the adverse comments received on these actions. In a subsequent final
rule USEPA will summarize and respond to the comments received and announce final rulemaking action on this requested
Indiana SIP

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB Circular A&hyph;110 covers both grants made by Federal agencies and subgrants made by States to nongovernmental
organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies were required to adopt those standards which would be imposed on grantees in codified regulations within
six months after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over 200 comments were received by OMB from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations, professional organizations,
and others in response to the notice published on August 27, 1992 (57 FR 39018) requesting comments on proposed revisions.
The comments were considered in developing the final version. Consequently, this rule is published as an interim
final rule because of the previous request for comment process used in the development of the Circular, the large number
of comments already received and considered by OMB and the Federal agencies, and due to the limited flexibility to
revise the rule provided by OMB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule essentially adopts all the language in the Circular with two exceptions. At Section 12.904,
language has been added to describe the procedure for handling requests for class deviations and case-by-case exceptions.
At Section 12.915, the Department is including a term and condition concerning use of the metric system of measurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is revising 43 CFR part 12, by adding subpart F to implement these requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The policy of the Department of the Interior, is whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments, suggestions or objections
regarding the interim final rule to the location identified in this preamble.

This interim final rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities because it does not affect the amount of funds provided in the covered programs, but rather modifies
and updates administrative and procedural requirements. This interim final rule does not contain a collection of
information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), may grant exceptions for classes of grants or recipients subject to the
requirements of this subpart when exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in the interest of maximum uniformity,
exceptions from the requirements of this subpart shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. Federal awarding
agencies may apply more restrictive requirements to a class of recipients when approved by OMB. All requests for class
deviations shall be processed through the Assistant Secretary_Policy, Management, and Budget. Federal awarding
agencies may apply less restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except for statutory requirements.
Exceptions on a case-by-case basis may also be made by Federal awarding agencies. Bureau/office application of less
restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except for statutory requirements as well as exceptions on
a case-by-case basis, will be approved by designated officials identified in bureau/office procedures.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In each instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative
agreement, or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301&hyph;08) governs the use
of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal
purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute.
The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, ``substantial
involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying
out the activity contemplated in the agreement.'' Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition
of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Additional requirements may only be imposed provided that the applicant or recipient is notified in writing as
to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The nature of the additional requirements;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The reason why the additional requirements are being imposed;

Metric system of measurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the
metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency
to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement
will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation
may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies
in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. Federal awarding agencies will follow the provisions of
E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.'' When applicable, the awarding agency shall request
that measurement-sensitive information to be included as part of the application be expressed in metric units. When
required by the awarding agency for grants to recipients, the following term and condition will be incorporated into
the grant:

Provision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All progress and final reports, other reports, or publications produced under this award shall employ the metric
system of measurement. However, the recipient may use non-metric measurements to the extent that the recipient has
supporting documentation that the use of metric measurements is impracticable or is likely to cause significant
inefficiencies or loss of markets to the recipient, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products
in non-metric units.

Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a political subdivision
of a State that is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with Section 6002. Section 6002 requires that preference
be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified
in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247&hyph;254). Accordingly,
State and local institutions of higher education and hospitals that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal
funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products
pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

Standards for financial management systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to relate financial data to performance data and develop
unit cost information whenever practical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the following.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program
in accordance with the reporting requirement set forth in Section 12.952. If a Federal awarding agency requires reporting
on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall
not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop accrual data for their reports
on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These
records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, outlays, income and interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property, and other assets. Recipients shall adequately
safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should
be related to performance and unit cost data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient.
To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;453) govern, payment
methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements
or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under
Federal Grant and Other Programs.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Accounting records, including cost accounting records, that are supported by source documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal
awarding agency at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements
of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient
coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above in Section 12.921 (c) &amp; (d), the bonds shall be obtained
from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety
Companies Doing Business with the United States.''

and the issuance of redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of
State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures
codified at 31 CFR part 205.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) (1) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain or
demonstrate:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient,
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in
Section 12.921.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance
with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved
program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the
actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share
of any allowable indirect costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Whenever possible, advances will be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal
awarding agency to the recipient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF&hyph;270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,''
or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to
the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special Federal
awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. Federal
awarding agencies may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction
project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes
a minor portion of the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt
of the billing, unless the billing is improper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit a request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers
are not used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency has determined that
reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency
may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance
cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's
disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements.
The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely
advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on
a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned
on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges
made by recipients at any time during the project period unless paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal
reporting requirements; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;129,
``Managing Federal Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable
notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until
the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, Federal awarding agencies shall not require
separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories
for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure
of funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients are encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least
50 percent by women or minority group members).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraph (h) (1),
(2) or (3) apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250
per year on Federal cash balances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected
Federal and non-Federal cash resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment
Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient
for administrative expense. In keeping with Electric Funds Transfer rules, (31 CFR part 206), interest should be
remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electric medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients
who do not have this capability should use a check. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA as it pertains
to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay preaward costs for discretionary awards without
prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this subpart, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting
advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement.'' Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF&hyph;270
as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs where electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods
are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in
lieu of the SF&hyph;271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) SF&hyph;271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.'' Each Federal awarding
agency shall adopt the SF&hyph;271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction
programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF&hyph;270 when the Federal awarding agency determines
that it provided adequate information to meet Federal needs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used
for cost sharing or matching.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal awarding agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Conform to other provisions of this subpart, as applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the
Federal awarding agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable
cost principles. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities
acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the
lesser of paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the
time of donation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency
may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value
at the time of donation to the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled
labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project
or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization.
In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent
with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved.
In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued
at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable,
but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally
paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Donated supplies may include such items as office supplies, laboratory supplies, or workshop and classroom supplies.
Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not
exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings, and land for which
title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraph (1) or (2) of this section
apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient to acquire equipment, buildings, or land, the total value
of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings, or land, normally
only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved
the charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient,
with the following qualifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed their fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient
as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition
at the time of donation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent
appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third
parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient
for its own employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall
be documented.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained
by the recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award,
shall be used in one or more of the following ways:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) added to funds committed to the project or program by the Federal awarding agency and recipient and used to further
eligible project or program objectives;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs upon which the
Federal share of costs is based.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When an agency authorizes the disposition of program income as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be use in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this
section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the award how program
income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all projects or programs except
research. For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply automatically unless the
awarding agency indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award or the recipient is subject
to special award conditions, as indicated in Section 12.924.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients
shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, costs incident
to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these
costs have not been charged to the award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards
(See Sections 12.930 through 12.937).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients
shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties
for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However,
Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or
research award.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

with OMB Circular A&hyph;21, ``Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,'' OMB Circular A&hyph;122,
``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,'' or 45 CFR part 74 Appendix E, ``Principles for Determining Costs

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by
OMB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraph (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, Federal Awarding agencies are
authorized, at their option to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this subpart
and OMB Circulars A&hyph;21 and A&hyph;122. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more
of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the
Federal awarding agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the Federal awarding agency
is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award
is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the conditions
listed below apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing, with
the supporting reasons and revised expiration date, at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award.
This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. The conditions
that prevent issuance of a one-time extension are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) the terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the extension requires additional Federal funds; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For awards the support research, unless the Federal awarding agency provides otherwise in the award or in the agency's
regulations, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e)(1) through (3) of this section are automatically
waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph
(e)(2) applies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or
programs, functions, and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the
cumulative amount of the transfer exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by
the Federal awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation
or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) No other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section
require prior approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies
for budget revisions whenever paragraph (h)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) additional Federal funds are needed to complete the project; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the recipient requests a revision that involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements
may be imposed under Section 12.927.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items will be imposed unless OMB approves a deviation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) When a Federal awarding agency makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction
work, the Federal awarding agency may require the recipient to request prior approval before making any fund or budget
transfers between the two types of work supported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify
the Federal awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed
the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5,000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever
is greater. This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation
award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application
unless the Federal awarding agency indicates that a letter of request suffices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, the Federal awarding agency
shall review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision
is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient
in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal awarding agency for the use of real property in other
federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose
of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e.,
awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the Department of the Interior.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor. The Federal awarding agency
shall give one or more of the following disposition instructions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates
the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal
participation in the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and
pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the
Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any,
from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures
shall be established that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third
party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage
of the current fair market value of the property.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federally-owned property.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually
to the Federal awarding an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody. Upon completion of the
award, or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to the Federal awarding agency
for further Federal utilization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to
the General Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has statutory authority to dispose of the
property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C.
3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821,
``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals.'') Appropriate instructions
shall be issued to the recipient by the Federal awarding agency.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exempt property.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When statutory authority exists, the Federal awarding agency has the option to vest title to property acquired with
Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions the Federal
awarding agency considers appropriate. Such property is ``exempt property.'' Should a Federal awarding agency
not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further
obligation to the Federal Government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions
of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside
organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically
authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without
approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient
shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency, then
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) activities sponsored by other Federal agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or
program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other
projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall
be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government,
use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the Federal
awarding agency. User charges shall be treated as program income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of the Federal
awarding agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned
equipment shall include all of the following.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information.

fair market value where a recipient compensates the Federal awarding agency for its share.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least
once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in
the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection
with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment.
Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the
Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the Federal awarding agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established
which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance
with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or more, the recipient
may retain the equipment for other uses if compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency or its successor.
The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the
original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment,
the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency
shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within
that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by the Federal
awarding agency to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. The Federal
awarding agency shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request
and the following procedures shall govern:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If so instructed, or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's
request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an amount computed by applying
to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However,
the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever
is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal
Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost
of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping
or interim storage costs incurred.

awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party
named by the Federal Government when the third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. The transfer
shall be subject to the following standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise described to the recipient in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a
final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally owned equipment.

inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project
or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally sponsored project or program, the recipient shall
retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate
the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Purpose of procurement standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 12.941 through 12.948 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement
of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These
standards are furnished to ensure that materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance
with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or
requirements shall be imposed by the Federal awarding agencies upon recipients, unless specifically required by
Federal statute or executive order or approved by OMB.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Federal awarding agency,
regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements
entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source
evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to
such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

Codes of conduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her
partner, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial
or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither
solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements.
However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift
is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for the related procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose
bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other
factors considered. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill
in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the
recipient's interest to do so.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.

resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration
and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small
businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who posses the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor
integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources, and accessibility to other necessary
resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies' implementation
of E.O.s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' See Subpart D of 43 CFR part 12.

The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the provisions below
in all contracts and subcontracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements
of the recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest
is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the
time specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.

United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers
and records of the contractor that are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations,

Monitoring and reporting program performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function, or activity
supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure that subrecipients have met the audit requirements
in Section 12.926.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency of submission for performance reports. Except as provided
in &sect;12.951(f), performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently
than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the end of the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual
reports shall be due 30 days after the end of the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may require annual reports
before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. Final performance reports are
due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A final technical or performance report shall be required after completion of the project only if the awarding
agency determines this to be appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the
following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings
of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high
unit costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Federal awarding agency of developments that have a significant impact
on the award-supported activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse
conditions that materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include
a statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Federal awarding agencies may make site visits, as needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance
data from recipients.

Financial reporting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information
from recipients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A, Financial Status Report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Each Federal awarding agency will require recipients to use either the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A to report
the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the
option of not requiring the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A when the SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement,
or SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs,
except that a final SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF&hyph;270
is used only for advances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal
awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on an
accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop accrual information
through best estimates based upon an analysis of the documentation on hand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or
program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not
be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the
completion of the agreement.

(iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A (an original
and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and
semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved
by the Federal awarding agency upon request by the recipient.

(2) SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When funds are advanced to recipients, the Federal awarding agency shall require each recipient to submit the
SF&hyph;272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF&hyph;272a. The Federal awarding agency shall use this
report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the
recipients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of
the report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks''
section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations
of actions taken to reduce the excess balances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF&hyph;272 15 calendar
days following the end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly report from those recipients
receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for submission of the SF&hyph;272 for any one of the following
reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that the advances are monitored through other
forms contained in this section;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive
Federal advances; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall
be observed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall
issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in
Section 12.921, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be upon written notice to the recipient
until such time as the system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in obtaining this information,
shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line item or any report if not necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format
or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Federal awarding agencies may provide computer or electronic outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes
to the accuracy of reporting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement
is not applicable to the recipient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. as specified in paragraph 12.953(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Federal awarding agency will request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines
that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal
awarding agency may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint
use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers,
or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts,
transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's
personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph
are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall place restrictions on recipients that limit public
access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal awarding agency can demonstrate
that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom
of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the Federal awarding agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records:
indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of
the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe
benefit rates).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits
to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year
retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of the submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the
subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation
purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records
starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, it may terminate the grant in its entirety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in &sect;12.971(a), including
those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall
be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.

Enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award,
whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, the Federal awarding
agency may in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in Section 12.914, take one or more of the
following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement
action by the Federal awarding agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity
or action not in compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hearings and appeals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal,
or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable
to the action involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Effects of suspension and termination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination
of an award are not allowable unless the Federal awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension
or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary
and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension
or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period
in which the termination takes effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relationship to debarment and suspension.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient
from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and the Federal awarding agency implementing
regulations (see 43 CFR Part 12).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The right of the Federal award agency to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The obligation of the recipient to return any funds due as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions.

the consent of the Federal awarding agency and the recipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient referred
to in paragraph 12.973(a), including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions
made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.

(a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule establishes procedures to be followed when a National Science Foundation (NSF) employee is issued
a court demand or is requested to provide testimony or produce records in a legal proceeding. These procedures are
designed to promote economy and efficiency in NSF's programs and operations, to minimize the possibility of involving
NSF in controversial issues not related to its functions, to maintain the impartiality of NSF among private litigants,
and to protect sensitive, confidential information and the deliberative process.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 8, 1994, NSF published proposed procedures to be followed when a National Science Foundation (NSF) employee
is issued a court demand or is requested to provide testimony or produce records in a legal proceeding. 59 FR 35079 (July
8, 1994). NSF received two comment letters, one from an individual who supported adoption of the procedures as proposed,
and the other from a university concerned that the definition of the term ``employee'' could be interpreted to include
university faculty who receive NSF awards and/or serve as peer reviewers on NSF panels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``employee'' was not intended to cover investigators under NSF awards, and the definition has been revised
to make this explicit. However, the rule was intended to reach peer reviewers, but only as to matters directly relating
to their service for the Foundation. To the extent this was not clear in the proposed rule, Section 615.2 has been revised
to specifically provide that the rule's procedures do not apply to requests or demands for testimony by peer reviewers
that is directly related to their service as reviewers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these clarifications, the final rule includes the following four minor revisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 615.2&blank;Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The phrase ``while in leave status'' was deleted from this provision because only Government employees can be ``in
leave status'' but the provision is intended to apply to certain other individuals as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 615.4&blank;Legal Proceedings Before NSF or in Which the United States Is a Party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision was revised to provide that the General Counsel will arrange for testimony of current employees for
the United States, rather than for the testimony of both past and current employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 615.5&blank;Legal Proceedings Between Private Litigants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection (a) was intended to prevent employees from producing official records and information or providing testimony
unless authorized to do so by the General Counsel. The proposed rule's inclusion of the phrase ``or by other applicable
law'' at the end of the subsection created uncertainty as to the intent of the subsection, and, as a result, was deleted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (c) was revised to specifically provide that employees may testify as to any matter, if authorized to do
so by the General Counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I have determined that this proposed rule is not an economically significant rule as that term is defined in Executive
Order 12866. I have also determined that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant impact on
a substantial number of small entities as that term is defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612,
because it would affect only the conduct of NSF activities and actions of NSF personnel. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b),
the rule is therefore exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses requirements of sections
603 and 604.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If a response to a demand is required before the General Counsel has made the determination referred to in &sect;615.6(b),
the General Counsel shall provide the court or other competent authority with a copy of this part, inform the court
or other competent authority that the demand is being reviewed, and seek a stay of the demand pending a final determination.

2. On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Budget Act) added a new section 309(j) to the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 151&hyph;173 (the Communications Act). This amendment to the Communications
Act gave the Commission express authority to employ competitive bidding procedures to choose from among mutually
exclusive applications for initial licenses. The Commission's

3. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
established competitive bidding rules for narrowband PCS. The Commission decided that because of the interdependence
within certain classes of narrowband PCS licenses and the relatively high expected value of such licenses, where
the agency received mutually exclusive applications most narrowband PCS licenses would be awarded through a sequence
of simultaneous multiple round auctions. However, we stated that we might alternatively use oral sequential or single
round sealed bidding to award certain narrowband PCS licenses if the operational complexity or administrative costs
associated with simultaneous auctions proved excessive relative to the expected value of the licenses to be awarded.
We stated that in conducting narrowband PCS auctions we would generally follow the payment and procedural rules adopted
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and we adopted general procedural and processing rules for the narrowband PCS service based on Parts 22 and 90 of the
Commission's rules. We also structured our rules to provide opportunities for small businesses and businesses owned
by women and minorities to participate in the auction and in the provision of spectrum based services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On July 29, 1994 we completed the first spectrum auction for the ten available nationwide narrowband PCS licenses.
This auction was the first test of the simultaneous multiple round auction design and of our provisions for designated
entities. This auction was enormously successful. One indication of the efficiency of the simultaneous multiple
round bidding process is the fact that the winning bids were either identical or virtually identical for virtually
identical licenses. As we expected, this auction also attracted broad participation by designated entities. Of
the 29 registered bidders 9, or 30 percent, indicated status as either minority or woman-owned firms. The strong bidding
competition among relatively large firms and incumbent paging companies, however, may have been a factor in the lack
of designated entities among the winning bidders. These results have caused us to reexamine some of the auction rules
and designated entity provisions previously adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, we request comment on a number of possible further changes in the designated entity provisions that might
apply to the upcoming MTA and BTA auctions.

5. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission noted its earlier findings: (1) That licenses with strong value interdependencies should be auctioned
simultaneously, (2) that multiple round auctions will generally yield more efficient allocations of licenses and
higher revenues than other auction methodologies because they provide bidders with information regarding other
bidders' valuations of licenses, and (3) that simultaneous multiple round auctions become less cost effective as
the value of licenses decreases, because they are relatively time-consuming and expensive to implement.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission stated that where the licenses to be auctioned are interdependent and their value is expected to be
high, simultaneous multiple round auctions would best achieve the Commission's goals.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 We stated, however, that we might use methods other than simultaneous multiple round bidding in cases where license
values are expected to be relatively low, where bidder participation is expected to be limited, or where the interdependence
of licenses is less significant.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 We stated that in selecting the auction method for each narrowband PCS auction, we would balance the advantages of
more sophisticated auction methods, such as simultaneous multiple round bidding, with the greater complexity and
cost they might entail.

6. In the Third Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission decided to auction the 12.5 kHz unpaired MTA and BTA response channel licenses in a single round sealed
bid auction because the value of those licenses is low relative to the cost of conducting more complex auctions. We
also stated that because only incumbent paging licensees already serving the license area are eligible to bid on these
licenses, sealed bid auctions might help to reduce the likelihood of collusion. We further stated that information
about license values from earlier narrowband auctions would also be available to assist bidders in valuing these
licenses. Moreover, because under the sealed bid approach bidders cannot be certain that they will be the high bidder
on the licenses they seek to obtain, we allowed bidders to bid without risking a default penalty on more than the two
licenses in each service area, provided they specify in advance the order in which they wish to be awarded such licenses
if they are the high bidder on more than they are permitted to hold.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paging Network, Inc. (PageNet) and Tri-State Radio Co. (Tri-State) seek reconsideration of the decision to use single
round sealed bid auction procedures for assignment of the 12.5 kHz unpaired licenses.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 PageNet and Tri-State assert that the Commission has underestimated the likely value of the response channel licenses.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 PageNet and Tri-State also assert that great value interdependence exists among the response channel licenses.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 They state that there are likely to be numerous bidders for most licenses.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, PageNet claims that collusive behavior is no more likely for these licenses than for other narrowband
PCS licenses. PageNet and Tri-State question whether bidders for response channel licenses will obtain useful information
about license values from previous narrowband PCS auctions. PageNet asserts that license values will vary from one
provider and area to another, and that bidders may have no realistic idea as to the value of the licenses.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 PageNet claims that the single sealed bid mechanism will require exorbitantly expensive market research on the part
of bidders, and the result will still depend on chance.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Further, PageNet states that it is important to choose an auction method which provides useful information on license
values to bidders during the auction. Therefore, PageNet supports adopting an alternative auction method that is
streamlined to minimize cost and complexity, and recommends an ascending bid multiple round methodology.

8. Tri-State claims that the rules mandating single round sealed bidding are deficient from an auction design perspective.
Tri-State asserts that these rules are poorly structured to allow bidders to obtain a common frequency across regions,
and that under the rules bidders cannot know how to prioritize their bids. Tri-State further claims that the sealed
bidding procedures require exceedingly complicated bidding strategies, which necessitate the adoption of a clear
reallocation mechanism for defaulted licenses. Alternatively, Tri-State recommends a procedure in which bidders
submit sealed bids for a given MTA or BTA without specifying which of the available frequencies the bidder is bidding
on. Under Tri-State's recommended approach, winning bidders would be ranked for purposes of frequency selection
according to the total amount they bid for all the channels on which they hold winning bids. Tri-State claims that this
procedure maximizes the number of multiple MTA/BTA bidders who can obtain a common paging response channel in all
markets in which they bid.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Tri-State argues that its proposed auction procedures will level the playing field between bidders for paging response
channels and those for regional and nationwide narrowband PCS authorizations, who do not need to aggregate a common
frequency across geographic areas.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Tri-State includes a 25 percent bidding credit for minority- and female-owned businesses and small businesses,
and states that its plan could be refined by providing that winning bidders pay the highest losing bid for a license.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Tri-State asserts that its proposed auction procedures will ensure that the Commission maximizes revenues from
paging response license auctions and allow bidders to set priorities more accurately and to adopt relatively simple
bidding strategies.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 AirTouch recommends multiple round simultaneous auctions, and suggests that bids for the response channels be in
pool form, such that the highest four bidders would receive a license and could agree among themselves as to the licenses
to be held by each.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 American Paging, Inc. (API) supports multiple-round ascending simultaneous bidding methodologies, at least for
the MTA response channel licensing.

Discussion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners have convinced us that paging response channel licenses may have more value interdependency, and higher
value, than was apparent at the time of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We also recognize that alternative auction methodologies proposed by petitioners may offer a low-cost auction method
with desirable characteristics for auctioning interdependent licenses, and thus may prove superior to the sealed
bid approach set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the recent nationwide narrowband auction demonstrated that simultaneous multiple round auctions
are easier and less expensive to implement than we earlier anticipated, and thus they may prove to be an appropriate
procedure for auctioning the response channel licenses. However, we will defer our decision regarding the auction
design for the 12.5 kHz MTA and BTA paging response channels until we have gained further experience with simultaneous
multiple round auctions. We will announce our final choice of auction design and procedures for the response channels
by Public Notice prior to the auction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we stated that we believe it is necessary to impose a minimum bid increment to ensure that the auctions conclude within
a reasonable period of time in narrowband PCS auctions where simultaneous multiple round bidding is used. The bid
increment is the amount or percentage by which the bid must be raised above the previous round's high bid in order to
be accepted as a valid bid in the current round. We stated that we might impose a minimum bid increment of 5 percent or
$0.01 per MHz per pop, whichever is greater, in narrowband PCS auctions where multiple round bidding is used. We also
retained the discretion to vary the minimum bid increments for individual licenses or groups of licenses over the

11. In order to expedite the auction process further, we also reserve the discretion to establish a suggested opening
bid or a minimum opening bid on each license in addition to the minimum bid increment.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 If we were to adopt minimum opening bids, we anticipate that we would seek expedited comments on any figures proposed.
Once a minimum bid is established for a license, initial bids will have to be above that level to be considered valid.
The amount of the suggested opening bid or the minimum opening bid, if one is used, will be set forth in the Public Notice
announcing the auction. Generally, we will establish suggested opening bids or minimum opening bids in the range
of $.03&hyph;$.20 per MHz-pop for each license.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 A suggested opening bid or minimum opening bid will provide bidders with an incentive to start bidding at a substantial
portion of the license value, thus ensuring a rapid conclusion to the auction.

The number of ``MHz-pops'' is calculated by multiplying the population of the license service area by the amount of
spectrum authorized by the license. In its September 1993 Mid-Session Review of the 1994 Budget, the Office of Management
and Budget estimated that spectrum auctions would generate $12.6 billion from 1994 through 1998. A 1992 report by
the Congressional Budget Office assumed that $2 billion would be raised from competitive bidding in services other
than PCS. Thus, the approximate value of 120 MHz of PCS spectrum is placed at $10.6 billion according to these estimates,
or 35 cents per pop per MHz.

12. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we stated that when we use the three-stage Milgrom-Wilson activity rule, the auction will move from stage I to stage
II when, after three rounds of bidding, the high bid has changed on 5 percent or fewer of the licenses (measured in MHz-pops)
being auctioned. Stage III will begin when the high bid has changed on 2 percent or fewer licenses over three rounds.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 We conclude after our experience in conducting the nationwide narrowban auction that we may find it important to move
the auctions from one stage to the next at a different pace than would occur under this rule. Accordingly, we retain
the discretion to determine and announce during the course of an auction when, and if, to move from one auction stage
to the next, based on a variety of measures of bidder activity, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the percentage of licenses on which there are new bids, the number of new bids, and the percentage increase in revenue).
Bidders will be notified at least one round prior to the commencement of the next stage of an auction.

13. We also stated that in stage III, a bidder would have to be active on 100 percent of the MHz-pops for which it wishes
to retain eligibility.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 In order to allow bidders greater flexibility, we think that it may be beneficial in some auctions to reduce this figure
slightly, but in no case below 90 percent. We will announce the required activity levels for stage III in a Public Notice
in advance of each auction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we stated that where we use the Milgrom-Wilson activity rule we intend to use a simplified waiver procedure whereby
bidders will be permitted five automatic waivers from the activity rule during the course of an auction.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 A waiver permits a bidder to maintain its eligibility at the same level as in the round for which the waiver is submitted,
regardless of the bidder's level of bidding activity in that round. Subsequently, we have concluded based on our experience
in conducting the nationwide narrowband auction that fewer waivers may be necessary to maintain the pace of the auction
and prevent strategic use of waivers. Consequently, we will allow one automatic waiver from the activity rule during
each stage of an auction, or one automatic waiver during a number of bidding rounds specified in a Public Notice. We
retain the flexibility, however, to change by Public Notice the number of waivers that will be permitted and the frequency
with which they may be exercised by public notice prior to a specific narrowband auction. While we may allow bidders
to request proactive waivers that will keep the bidding open, under no circumstances will an automatic waiver prevent
an auction from closing.

15. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we retained the discretion to declare by announcement at any point during a multiple round auction that the auction
will end after a specified number of additional rounds.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 We want to clarify however, that if this procedure is used, we will accept bids in the final rounds only for licenses
on which the highest bid increased in at least one of the preceding three rounds. No new bids will be accepted for other
licenses.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 There are two reasons not to take bids on licenses on which there has been no recent bidding. First, the fact that bidding
on an individual license may close will provide an additional incentive to bid actively and thus speed the conclusion
of the auction. If bids are accepted on all licenses in the final rounds there is less cost to a bidder in holding back.
Second, closing bidding on licenses for which activity has ceased ensures high bidders for those licenses that they
will not lose a license without having an opportunity to make a counter-offer.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 This reduces the uncertainty associated with aggregating licenses that are worth more to a particular bidder as a
package than individually. If final bids are accepted on all licenses, a high bidder on an aggregation of licenses
may unexpectedly lose a critical part of the aggregation and have no chance to regain it except in the post-auction
market, where bargaining or other transaction costs may be high.

Either the auction will close only when bidding ceases on all licenses, so the high bidder will have an opportunity
to respond to any new bids, or the Commission will call for final bids but not accept new bids on licenses on which there
have been no new bids in the previous three rounds, so no other bidder will have the opportunity to outbid the high bidder
in a final round.

Petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Phase One asserts that the Communications Act permits the FCC to employ competitive bidding procedures only where
mutual exclusivity exists, and that consequently the FCC is prohibited from establishing specific auction dates
until it has determined that a particular application is mutually exclusive with another.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 Phase One states that the FCC must first notify each qualified applicant of its application processing status in advance
of scheduling auctions to allow applicants sufficient time to analyze auction strategies and evaluate the competition.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 Phase One also states that the FCC is obligated to suspend its auctions until each petition in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253
has been addressed.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 Phase One states that our contractor, Tradewinds International, Inc. (Tradewinds) must be prevented from promoting
FCC auctions. Because there can be no auctions without mutual exclusivity, according to Phase One the advertising
by Tradewinds amounts to false and misleading advertising and raises conflict of interest questions because Tradewinds
may benefit if auctions are actually held.

Discussion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Budget Act provides that if applications are not mutually exclusive no auction will be held.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 We have found, however, that it is important to begin planning for auctions as early as possible to assure that they
will run smoothly. To maintain an expeditious auctioning and licensing schedule it is necessary, for instance, to
reserve sites for auctions before all applications have been received. Further, we believe that it is important that
we schedule auctions far enough in advance to provide applicants with ample time to attract financing and plan their
bidding strategies. In any event, we have previously indicated that we will cancel a scheduled auction if we do not
receive mutually exclusive applications.
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 Consequently we believe that our auction schedule and procedures are fully consistent with the provisions of the
Budget Act.

are eligible to bid on each of the ten licenses. Thus, mutual exclusivity exists for all nationwide narrowband licenses,

20. We find advertising of auctions desirable and in the public interest, even if, because of lack of mutual exclusivity,
no auction takes place for some licenses. Among its other beneficial effects, advertising of auctions may be essential
for making potential licensees, and in particular designated entities, aware of the opportunities available to
them. In order to make service available as rapidly and efficiently as possible, we must ensure that those who value
the license most highly, and will offer the services most valued by the public, have an opportunity to bid on them. Mutual
exclusivity cannot be established until applications have been received, and at that point advertising will no longer
be useful because the purpose of advertising is to inform potential licensees of the opportunity to file applications.
Consequently, we retain our existing filing procedures and continue to permit our contractor to advertise auctions
even before mutual exclusivity has been established.

Petition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AIDE asserts in its petition for reconsideration of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that the Commission acted improperly in proposing substantive PCS application-processing rules in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPRM 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
because, it argues, such rules are outside the scope of this rulemaking, which is limited to implementation of the
competitive bidding requirements of &sect;309(j) of the Communications Act.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 AIDE argues that the Commission's proposal of application-processing rules is legally insufficient to constitute
a valid notice of proposed rules, and that some of the rules cited have no immediate applicability to PCS service. AIDE
asserts that in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission failed to respond to the merits of the arguments concerning filing and processing rules in AIDE's comments
on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPRM. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AIDE concludes that the Commission needs to issue a supplemental 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to adopt license-processing rules for PCS. PacBell states, however, that the Administrative Procedure Act does
not prohibit the Commission from issuing more than one order based on a notice and comment period.
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 PacBell also states that there is an exception to the Administrative Procedure Act's notice and comment requirements
``when the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding *&blank;*&blank;* in the rules issued) that
notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.''

24. The competitive bidding process is a means of assigning licenses, and rules and procedures for processing of license
applications are an integral and necessary part of that process. By citing in the NPRM the specific Part 22 and Part
90 application processing rules that we would use as the basis for adopting PCS rules, we provided commenters with
exceptionally clear notice and an opportunity to comment on the rules we contemplated adopting for narrowband PCS.
The few changes that we made from the proposed rules were necessary to adapt them to auctioning narrowband PCS licenses.
For example, we adopted certain technical requirements such as restrictions on station antenna structures.
<FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>
 We also deleted any procedures that were related to grants by random selection.
<FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>
 The resulting rules are clearly a logical outgrowth of the rules proposed in the NPRM, applied in the context of the
use of competitive bidding to assign narrowband PCS licenses. Rules adopted as a logical outgrowth comply with all
Administrative Procedure Act requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
prevent bidders for narrowband PCS licenses from entering into settlement agreements after applications are filed.
AIDE asserts that narrowband bidders should be allowed to enter into settlement agreements, as encouraged by &sect;24.429(b),
and asserts that the Commission's decision to avoid post-filing settlements was impermissibly based on consideration
of potential revenues. Quentin L. Breen (Breen) urges us to act on AIDE's petition to liberalize treatment of full
market settlements. Breen states that the Budget Act does not relieve the Commission of its obligation in the public
interest to continue to use means such as negotiation to avoid mutual exclusivity, nor does the Act oblige us to adopt
anti-collusion regulations. Instead of permitting applicants to avoid the uncertainties and inefficiencies of
the auction process, Breen states that the rules effectively mandate that parties will go to end of the auction without
being able to consider settlement.
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 PageNet, conversely, urges the Commission to prohibit any settlement negotiations during the competitive bidding
process.
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 According to PageNet, there is no way for mutually exclusive applicants to come to an agreement on settlement without
exchanging the same kinds of information that would be exchanged for the formation of collusive strategies in auction
bidding. Accordingly, PageNet asserts that settlement discussions should be prohibited prior to selection of a
winner from among the Form 175 applicants.
<FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, PageNet contends, that there is little likelihood of an all-market settlement in any given market,
because if any one applicant declines to settle, the settlement is defeated.

Discussion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As stated in our reconsideration of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we have decided to retain the existing collusion rules, to the extent that they prevent settlements after applications
are filed.
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 These rules were designed to avoid formation of anticompetitive agreements among bidders, although we intend to
continue reliance on the antitrust laws as our primary method of avoiding bidder collusion.
<FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>
 As we indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we believe that our rules prohibiting collusion will serve the objectives of the Budget Act by preventing applicants,
especially the largest companies, from entering into agreements to use bidding strategies that divide the market
to the disadvantage of other bidders.
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 We also seek to ensure that entities will not file applications solely for the purpose of demanding payment from other
bidders in exchange for settlement or withdrawal of their applications.

27. Accordingly, to ensure that the bidding process is competitive and to encourage formation of a competitive post-auction
market structure, we are retaining the collusion rules in the narrowband PCS context.
<FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, to make clear that we recognize that these rules effectively prohibit post-filing settlements, we
are amending our rules to eliminate Section 24.429(b). We believe that this is the most straightforward approach,
given our strong concerns that collusion could have an extremely harmful impact upon competition.

28. However, in order to provide bidders sufficient time and greater flexibility to attract capital, we make several
modifications to our collusion rules adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. First, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we clarified the applicability of the collusion rules to cases where an applicant has a common ownership interest
with another applicant.
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 In that item we stated that, unless the second applicant is expressly identified as an entity with whom the first applicant
has an agreement concerning bidding, we will prohibit these parties from communicating concerning their bidding
strategies. This prohibition will hold even if the other bidder is identified on the applicant's short-form application
as having a common ownership interest with the applicant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
29. Furthermore, where common non-controlling ownership exists between two or more bidders, those bidders may win
more licenses cumulatively than a single entity is entitled to hold. In such cases we will permit divestiture of non-controlling
interests to bring the entities into compliance with the license aggregation limits provided such divestiture is
completed within 90 days of grant of the license. Such post-auction divestiture will enable investors to finance
more than one bidder without risking default penalties if both bidders win licenses which in combination exceed our
aggregation limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. In addition, we wish to modify our rules regarding amendments to short-form applications. Section 24.413 of the
Commission's rules requires all applicants to list certain ownership information including all partners, subsidiaries,
affiliates and all persons holding five percent or more of the stock, warrants, options or debt securities of the applicant.
Section 24.422(b) currently prohibits amendments to the short-form application to make ownership changes or changes
in the parties to bidding consortia after the application filing deadline has passed. As a result of our experience
in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction we believe that it is necessary to allow applicants to amend their FCC Form
175 applications to make ownership changes after the filing deadline has passed, provided such changes do not result
in a change in control of the applicant and provided that discussions leading up to such changes do not violate our anti-collusion
rules. Such amendments must be made within two business days of any such change. Permitting such amendments will provide
bidders with flexibility to seek additional capital after applications have been filed, while ensuring that the
real party in interest does not change. Accordingly, we will modify rule 24.422(b) to permit applicants to amend their
FCC Form 175 applications to reflect ownership changes that do not result in a change in control of the applicant. Such
changes shall not be regarded as major amendments to an application, provided they do not result in a transfer of control
of the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. In addition, we are modifying our collusion rules, which currently prohibit bidders from communicating with
one another after short form applications have been filed regarding the substance of their bids or bidding strategies
and which also prohibit bidders from entering into consortia arrangements or joint bidding agreements of any kind
after the deadline for short form applications has passed. In order to permit bidders to respond to higher than expected
license prices by combining their resources during an auction, we will now permit bidders who have not filed Form 175
applications for any of the same licenses to engage in discussions and enter into bidding consortia or joint bidding
arrangements during the course of an auction. We conclude that where bidders have not applied for any of the same licenses
there is little risk of anticompetitive conduct with respect to a single license and therefore we believe that it is
appropriate to relax our collusion rules to permit bidders in this context to have greater flexibility to increase
their competitiveness in the auction by combining their resources, provided that no change of control of any applicant
takes place.

32. Mercury submitted a request for clarification that non-incumbent paging licensees will be permitted to apply
for only those narrowband paging response channel licenses that remain available after the initial response channel
auctions. Eligibility requirements for these channels were adopted in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314, and therefore
we will address this issue as part of the further reconsideration of the narrowband PCS service rules in that docket
and in ET Docket No. 92&hyph;100.

Background.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, Congress amended the Communications Act to require the Commission
to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by women and minority group members
(designated entities) would have an opportunity to obtain licenses and participate in offering spectrum-based
services.
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 We considered numerous alternatives that might ensure opportunities for these designated entities, including
installment payment plans, bidding credits, spectrum set-asides, tax certificates, royalty payments, innovator's
preferences, and distress sales to designated entities.
<FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>
 After considering the characteristics of the narrowband PCS service, we ultimately adopted installment payments
for small businesses acquiring certain regional, MTA or BTA licenses.
<FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>
 We also provided that a 25 percent bidding credit would be available to businesses owned by minorities and/or women
on certain nationwide, regional, MTA and BTA licenses.
<FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>
 Both installment payments and bidding credits were made available to small businesses owned by minorities and/or
women. In addition, we provided that tax certificates would be made available to encourage investment in women- and
minority-owned businesses.
<FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>
 Our rules, however, did not permit rural telephone companies to obtain bidding credits or installment payments unless
they also qualified as small businesses or businesses owned by minorities and/or women.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three petitions assert that provisions made available for various designated entities, such as bidding credits,
installment payments and tax certificates, should also be made available to all designated entity groups, and for
all narrowband PCS licenses. The Association of Independent Designated Entities (AIDE) suggests that bidding credits,
currently available for all businesses owned by minorities 
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
and/or women, should be granted to all small businesses and rural telephone companies, for all narrowband PCS licenses.
<FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>
 AIDE reasons that even if bidding credits are not appropriate for small businesses applying for nationwide licenses
(because small businesses can not afford to construct nationwide narrowband PCS systems), the Commission should
nevertheless permit small businesses to obtain bidding credits for the smaller, geographically limited narrowband
licenses.
<FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>
 AIDE also states that the decision to limit installment payments to certain licenses was impermissibly based on maximizing
auction revenues.

 We have decided, in response to petitions and to our experience with the nationwide narrowband auction, to expand

business to expand eligibility. Second, for the upcoming regional narrowband auctions we will increase the bidding
credit for women- and minority-owned businesses.

38. Congress mandated that the Commission ``ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses
owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based
services.''
<FOOTCITE>76</FOOTCITE>
 To achieve this goal, the statute requires the Commission to ``consider the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences,
and other procedures.'' Thus, while providing that we may charge for licenses, Congress has ordered that the Commission
design its auction procedures to ensure that designated entities have opportunities to obtain licenses and provide
service. For that purpose, the law does not mandate the use of any particular procedure but it specifically approves
the use of ``tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures.'' The use of any such procedure is, in our
view, mandated where necessary to achieve Congress's objective of ensuring that designated entities have the opportunity
to participate in narrowband PCS.

that in establishing eligibility criteria and bidding methodologies the Commission shall ``promot[e] economic
opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American
people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants,
including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.''
<FOOTCITE>77</FOOTCITE>
 Further, Section 309(j)(4)(A) provides that to promote the statute's objectives the Commission shall ``consider
alternative payment schedules and methods of calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment payments,

of such schedules and methods.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eligibility criteria and general rules to govern the special measures for small businesses, and businesses owned
by members of minority groups and women. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we employed several measures, including installment payments, bidding credits and tax certificates, to enhance
opportunities for designated entities bidding on certain narrowband PCS licenses. We stated that we believed that
narrowband PCS would provide significant opportunities for all designated entities to provide a wide variety of
new services including advanced paging and messaging services. In adopting the particular measures for designated
entities, however, we assumed that narrowband PCS would involve relatively low capital entry requirements, and
would therefore be well-suited to small entities, which lack access to large amounts of capital.
<FOOTCITE>78</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, we found that the measures we selected for narrowband PCS auctions were appropriately tailored to the
unique characteristics of narrowband PCS and would therefore ``create meaningful incentives for small businesses
and businesses owned by minorities and/or women to both bid successfully for available licenses and provide innovative
and expeditious service to the public.
<FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard we indicated that installment payments would provide a significant means for small businesses to overcome
their main barrier to entry: lack of access of financing. And, a 25 percent bidding credit for minority and women-owned
businesses together with a tax certificate program would address the additional obstacles faced by those designated
entities. We noted, however, that we would continue to assess the effectiveness of the measures adopted for narrowband
PCS, and would apply any knowledge gained to subsequent auctions.

41. Our goal in the narrowband personal communications service is to meet fully the statutory mandate of Section 309(j)(4)(D),
as well as the objectives of promoting economic opportunity and competition, of avoiding excessive concentration
of licenses, and of ensuring access to new and innovative technologies by disseminating licenses among a wide variety
of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority
groups and women. As explained more fully below, we believe that it is necessary in some respects to do more to ensure
that small businesses and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have a meaningful opportunity
to participate in the provision of narrowband PCS. As a result of our experience in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction,
we are concerned that a 25 percent bidding credit and installment payments may not be sufficient to ensure the opportunity
of these businesses to compete against the larger, deep pocketed incumbent firms. Therefore, we have decided to expand
the provisions for designated entities as described below.

for financial and/or management assistance under the SBIC program was increased to $18 million net worth and $6 million
after-tax net income. 13 CFR 121.802(a)(3)(i). The change in this size standard was attributable to an adjustment
for inflation and changes in the SBIC program ``designed to strengthen and expand the capabilities of SBICs to finance

43. Many commenters, including the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA, argue that the SBA net worth/net revenue
definition is too restrictive and will exclude businesses of sufficient size to survive, much less succeed, in the
competitive PCS marketplace. The SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy and the Suite 12 Group advocate adoption of a gross
revenue test, arguing that a net worth test could be misleading as some very large companies have low net worth. The
SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy recommends that the revenue standard be raised to include firms that (together with
affiliates) have less than $40 million in gross revenues. Similarly, Suite 12 suggests a $75 million in annual sales
threshold. As another option, the SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy suggests that the Commission consider a higher
revenue ceiling or adopt different size standards for different telecommunications markets.

of this alternative SBA definition would open up a huge loophole in the designated entity eligibility criteria. Specifically,
they contend that telecommunications is a capital, rather than labor, intensive industry, and that a entity with
1,500 employees is likely to be extremely well capitalized and have no need for the special treatment mandated by Congress
in the Budget Act.

44. We now realize that the cost of acquiring a narrowband PCS license will be significant and bidders may be required
to expend millions of dollars to acquire a license and construct a system in PCS markets. Thus, we believe that our current
narrowband PCS small business definition is overly restrictive because it would exclude most businesses possessing
the financial resources to compete successfully in the provision of narrowband PCS services. Accordingly, we modify
our small business definition for narrowband PCS auctions to ensure the participation of small businesses with the

45. There is substantial support in the record for a $40 million gross revenue standard. For example, the SBA recommends
that for PCS, a small business be defined as one whose average annual gross revenues for its past three years do not exceed
$40 million.
<FOOTCITE>82</FOOTCITE>
 It states that this definition isolates those companies that have significantly greater difficulty in obtaining
capital than larger enterprises. At the same time, the SBA contends that a company with $40 million in revenue is sufficiently
large that it could survive in a competitive wireless communications market.
<FOOTCITE>83</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy asserts that a $40 million threshold will allow participation by firms
``of sufficient size to meet demands in almost all small markets and some medium-size markets without significant
outside financial assistance.''

Qualified ``Small Businesses''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a general rule, the gross revenues of all investors in, and affiliates of, an applicant are counted on a cumulative,
fully-diluted basis for purposes of determining whether the $40 million gross revenue threshold has been exceeded,
and on an individual basis regarding the $40 million personal net worth standard.
<FOOTCITE>87</FOOTCITE>
 There are two exceptions to this rule, however. First, applicants that meet the definition of a small business may,
as discussed below, form consortia of small businesses that, on a aggregate basis, exceed the gross revenue cap. Second,
the gross revenues, personal net worth, and affiliations of any investor in the applicant are not considered so long
as the investor holds 25 percent or less of the applicant's passive equity. For corporations, we shall use the term
passive equity investors to mean investors who hold only non-voting stock or voting stock that includes no more than
15 percent of the voting interests. Where different classes of stock are held, however, the total amount of equity
must still be no more than 25 percent to meet this requirement. For partnerships, the term means limited partnership
interests that do not have the power to exercise control of the entity.
<FOOTCITE>88</FOOTCITE>
 The passive investor exception will be available, however, only so long as the applicant remains under the control
of one or more entities or individuals (defined as the ``control group'') and the control group holds at least 25 percent
of the applicant's equity and, in the case of corporate applicants, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>89</FOOTCITE>
 In the case of partnership applicants, the control group must hold all the general partnership interests. Winning
bidders are required to identify on their long-form applications the identity of the members of this control group
and the means of ensuring control (such as a voting trust agreement). The gross revenues of each member of the control
group and each member's affiliates will be counted toward the $40 million gross revenues threshold and applicants
shall certify that each control group member meets the individual $40 million personal net worth standard, regardless
of the size of the member's total interest in the applicant.

Applicants must be prepared to demonstrate that the limited partners do not have influence over the affairs of the

48. The attribution levels we have selected here are intended to balance the competing considerations that apply
in this particular context and may differ from those we have used in other circumstances. As a general matter, the 25
percent limitation on equity investment interests will serve as a safeguard that the very large entities who are excluded
from bidding in these blocks do not, through their investments in qualified firms, circumvent the gross revenue cap.
At the same time, it will afford qualified bidders a reasonable measure of flexibility in obtaining needed financing
from other entities, while ensuring that such entities do not acquire controlling interests in the eligible bidders.
Similarly, the 15 percent threshold for attributing revenues of investors with voting stock in corporate applicants
is designed to keep ineligible parties from exerting undue influence over eligible firms. For all of these reasons,
we also will attribute the gross revenues of entities, or the personal net worth of individuals, that otherwise constitute
``affiliates'' of the applicant.

Qualified Woman and Minority-Owned Small Businesses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The record demonstrates that women and minorities have especially acute problems in obtaining financing, due in
part to discriminatory lending practices by private financial institutions. To address these special problems
and to afford women and minority-owned small businesses more flexibility in attracting financing, it is necessary
to provide these entities with an alternative, somewhat more relaxed option regarding the attribution of revenues
of passive investors. Under the alternative standard, we will not attribute to the applicant the gross revenues or
net worth of any single investor in a minority or woman-owned small business applicant unless it holds more than 49.9
percent of the passive equity (which is defined to include as much as 15 percent of a corporation's voting stock). To
guard against abuses, however, the control group of applicants choosing this option would have to own at least 50.1
percent of the applicant's equity, as well as retain control and hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>91</FOOTCITE>
 Winning bidders must identify on their long-form applications a control group (this time consisting entirely of
minorities and/or women or entities 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women) and the gross revenues
and net worth of each member of the control group and each member's affiliates will be counted toward the $40 million
gross revenue threshold or the individual $40 million personal net worth limitation, regardless of the size of the
member's total interest in the applicant.

50. Relaxing the attribution standard somewhat in determining the eligibility of woman and minority-owned companies
to bid as small businesses directly addresses what most commenters have stated to be the biggest obstacle to entry
for these designated entities: obtaining adequate financing. By this measure, women and minorities who are eligible
to bid as small businesses (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 who otherwise meet the $40 million gross revenue standard) will be required to maintain control of their companies
and, at the same time, will have flexibility to attract significant infusions of capital from a single investor. The
requirement that the minority and women principals hold 50.1 percent of the company's equity mitigates substantially
the danger that a well-capitalized investor with a substantial ownership stake will be able to assume 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

51. Of course, women and minority-owned firms, like any other small business applicant, may sell a larger portion
of their companies' equity, provided that they also abide by the general eligibility requirements for small businesses.
Specifically, the gross revenues and net worth of all investors holding more than 25 percent of the company's passive
equity (as defined to include 15 percent or more of the voting stock) will be attributed toward the $40 million cap and
the $40 million personal net worth standard. In this event, the control group will be required to hold at least 25 percent
of the company's equity and 50.1 percent of its voting stock.

De Facto Control Issues.

de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control of the firms that are eligible for special treatment under the rules for narrowband PCS. For this purpose,
we shall borrow from certain SBA rules that are used to determine when a firm should be deemed an affiliate of a small
business. These SBA rules, which are codified in 13 CFR 121.401, provide several specific examples of instances in
which an entity might have control of a firm even though the entity has less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern,
and thus provide a useful model for our rules. Through reference to circumstances such as those described in the SBA
rules, our rules will expressly alert designated entities that control of the applicant through ownership of 50.1
percent of the firm's voting interests may be insufficient to ensure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control of the applicant if, for example, the voting stock of the eligible control group is widely dispersed. In those
and other circumstances, ownership of 50.1 percent of the voting stock may be insufficient to assure control of the
applicant. Of course, apart from these structural issues relative to control, eligible entities must not, during
the license term, abandon control of their licenses through any other mechanism. As we stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Memorandum Opinion and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we concluded that designated entities might be permitted to receive benefits based on their participation in consortium
on a service specific basis, but believed generally that such a consortium should not be entitled to qualify for measures
designed specifically for designated entities. As a general matter, we shall continue to adhere to that principle.
We think, however, that in the narrowband PCS service, allowing small businesses to pool their resources in this manner
is necessary to help them overcome capital formation problems and thereby ensure their opportunity to participate
in auctions and to become strong narrowband PCS competitors. Because of the exceptionally large capital requirements
associated with acquiring a license in this service, we agree with the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy that, so long
as individual members of the consortium satisfy the definition of a small business, the congressional objective
of ensuring opportunities for small businesses will be fully met. Individual small entities that join to form consortia,
as distinguished from a single entity with gross revenues in excess of $40 million, still are likely to encounter capital
access problems and, thus, should qualify for measures aimed at small businesses. We do not believe however, that
this congressional goal will be satisfied if special measures are allowed for consortia that are ``predominantly''
or ``significantly'' owned and/or controlled by small businesses. This would have the effect of eviscerating our
small business definition criteria and would not further the ability of

Financial Benefits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that the control group has a substantial financial stake in the venture, we shall adopt certain additional
requirements. As noted previously, we shall require that at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock and at least 25 percent
(or 50.1 percent for the alternative option for minority- and women-owned businesses) of the aggregate of all outstanding
shares of stock to be unconditionally owned by the control group members. In addition, 50.1 percent of the annual distribution
of dividends paid on the voting stock of a corporate applicant concern must be paid to these members. Also, in the event
stock is sold, the control group members must be entitled to receive 100 percent of the value of each share of stock in
his or her possession. Similarly, in the event of dissolution or liquidation of the corporation, the control group
members must be entitled to receive at least 25 percent (or 50.1 percent, as the case may be) of the retained earnings
of the concern and 100 percent of the value of each share of the stock in his or her possession, subject, of course, to
any applicable laws requiring that debt be paid before distribution of equity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
55. Partnerships and other non-corporate entities will be subject to similar requirements. Indicia of ownership
that we will consider in non-corporate cases include (but are not limited to) (a) the right to share in the profits and
losses, and receive assets or liabilities upon liquidation, of the enterprise 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in relationship to the designated entity's ownership percentage and (b) the absence of opportunities to dilute the
interest of the designated entity (through capital calls or otherwise) in the venture. As with corporations, our
concern is ensuring that the economic opportunities and benefits provided through these rules flow to designated
entities, as Congress directed.

 in their eligibility, and we intend to conduct random audits both before the auctions and during the 10-year initial
license period to ensure that our rules are complied with in letter and spirit. If we find that large firms or individuals
exceeding our personal net worth caps are able to assume control of licensees that have received small business provisions
or otherwise circumvent our rules, we will not hesitate to force divestiture of such improper interests or, in appropriate
cases, issue forfeitures or revoke licenses. In this regard, we reiterate that it is our intent, and the intent of Congress,

will be subject to repayment if, for example, another entity subsequently purchases an ``attributable'' interest
or becomes a member of the control group and, as a result, the gross revenues of the firm would exceed the $40 million
gross revenues cap, or the personal net worth of an individual investor exceeds the $40 million personal net worth

 In order to increase the opportunities for women and minorities to participate in the provision of narrowband service,
we have decided to increase the bidding credit on the same two licenses for women- and minority-owned businesses in
the upcoming regional narrowband auction from 25 percent to 40 percent. Our experience with the nationwide narrowband
PCS auctions, where very high license values coupled with only a 25 percent bidding credit may have contributed to
the failure of women- and minority-owned businesses to win licenses, suggests that a credit of this magnitude may
be necessary to overcome the disadvantages of these groups in bidding for licenses representing large populations
and large geographic areas.

59. In this docket, we established general rules and identified several measures, including installment payments,
spectrum set-asides, bidding credits and tax certificates, that we would choose among in establishing rules for
auctionable spectrum-based services, on a service-specific basis. In adopting service-specific rules, we have
carefully selected provisions to meet the particular needs of each designated entity group, so as to ``ensure,''
pursuant to the statute, that each group has the opportunity to participate in providing spectrum-based services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60. As we indicated above, it is occasionally necessary to do more to ensure that businesses owned by members of minority
groups and women have a meaningful opportunity to participate in provision of personal communications services
than is necessary to ensure that other designated entity groups have similar opportunities.
<FOOTCITE>96</FOOTCITE>
 The major problem facing minorities and women who seek to offer PCS is lack of access to capital.
<FOOTCITE>97</FOOTCITE>
 Small businesses also encounter serious funding problems.
<FOOTCITE>98</FOOTCITE>
 In contrast, rural telephone companies that are not small businesses (and are not owned by minorities or women) do
not face the same difficulties in obtaining capital. Accordingly, we do not believe that any additional provisions
for rural telephone companies are necessary or appropriate in the context of narrowband PCS. Moreover, as we stated
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 limiting installment payments to smaller businesses, including those owned by minorities and women, best comports
with the intent of Congress by avoiding auction procedures that tend to favor incumbents with established revenue
streams over new companies and entrepreneurs.
<FOOTCITE>99</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, rural telephone companies that are not eligible as small businesses will not receive installment payment
assistance.

61. Finally, we believe that special provisions for rural telephone companies that are not smaller entities are not
necessary in this context to encourage service to rural areas.
<FOOTCITE>100</FOOTCITE>
 Especially in regions where the lack of wireline service makes wireless alternatives desirable, paging service
is provided to rural areas by paging companies as well as telephone companies. We therefore believe that many telecommunications
companies, and not only rural telephone companies, will pursue ordinary profit incentives to provide narrowband
PCS service to outlying areas. Accordingly, we believe that installment payment plans are not necessary to encourage
larger rural telephone companies to provide this relatively low-cost service in rural areas.

D. Other Designated Entity Decisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
62. We make two additional decisions concerning designated entities on our own motion. First, we clarify that, for
a partnership to qualify for designated entity status, all general partners in the applicant and its ``control group''
must be eligible entities, consistent with our revised generic eligibility criteria in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Memorandum Opinion and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in this proceeding. For the purposes of our rules, we presume that all general partners in a partnership have the power
to bind the partnership, and therefore have 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control.
<FOOTCITE>101</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, to ensure that designated entity provisions are made available only to legitimate eligible entities
if the partnership is to receive designated entity benefits, all general partners will be required to be designated
entities if the partnership is to obtain designated entity status.

See, e.g., Fifth Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
&para;158 &amp; n. 134 (making such a presumption and therefore treating each general partner in a partnership applying
for broadband PCS licenses as part of the partnership's control group).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
63. In addition, we are adopting for narrowband PCS the requirement that all entities claiming a designated entity
benefit must substantiate their eligibility for such benefits. In a related action reconsidering the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in this proceeding, we are requiring applicants that seek designated entity benefits to document their eligibility
for such benefits.
<FOOTCITE>102</FOOTCITE>
 For narrowband PCS we therefore require designated entity applicants to describe on their long-form applications
how they meet the eligibility criteria for designated entity benefits. Applicants must list and summarize on their
long-form application all agreements that affect designated entity status, such as all partnership agreements,
shareholder agreements, management agreements and other agreements, including oral agreements, which establish
that the designated entity will have both 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control of the entity. In addition, we will require that such information be maintained at the licensee's facilities,
or by its designated agent, for the term of the license, and that the information be made available to Commission staff
upon request. We believe that this provision will prove useful when the Commission conducts its random audits of designated
entities providing narrowband PCS to ensure their continuing designated entity status.

in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the Narrowband PCS, applicants will be permitted to amend their Form 175 applications to make minor amendments
to correct minor errors or defects such as typographical errors. Applicants will also be permitted to amend FCC Form
175, to make ownership changes or changes in the identification of parties to bidding consortia, provided such changes
do not result in a change in control of the applicant and do not involve another applicant (or parties in interest to
an applicant) who has applied for any of the same licenses as the applicant. Amendments which change control of the
applicant will be considered major amendments. An FCC Form 175 which is amended by a major amendment will be considered
to be newly filed and cannot be resubmitted after applicable filing deadlines. See also &sect;1.2105 of this chapter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of which official notice may be taken, shall be supported
by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be sufficient to demonstrate

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Parties who file frivolous petitions to deny may be subject to sanctions including monetary forfeitures, license

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice expands the list of acceptable substitutes for ozone depleting substances (ODSs) under the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program. SNAP implements section 612 of the
amended Clean Air Act of 1990 whereby EPA is required to evaluate substitutes for the ODSs, and regulate the use of substitutes
where other alternatives exist that reduce overall risk to human health and the environment. Through these evaluations,
SNAP generates lists of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes for each of the major industrial use sectors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 18, 1994, EPA promulgated its plan for administering the SNAP program, and issued decisions on the acceptability
and unacceptability of a number of substitutes (59 FR 13044). In today's Notice, EPA is issuing decisions on the acceptability
of certain substitutes not previously reviewed by the Agency. The intended effect of this action is to expedite movement
away from ozone depleting compounds. To arrive at determinations on the acceptability of substitutes, the Agency
completed a cross-media sector end-use screening assessment of risks to human health and the environment.

B. Regulatory History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 18, 1994, EPA published the Final Rulemaking (FRM) (59 FR 13044) which described the process for administering
the SNAP program and issued EPA's first acceptability lists for substitutes in the major industrial use sectors.
These sectors include: Refrigeration and air conditioning; foam blowing; solvent cleaning; fire suppression and
explosion protection; sterilants; aerosols; adhesives, coatings and inks; and tobacco expansion. These sectors
compose the principal industrial sectors that historically consume the largest volumes of ozone-depleting compounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the final rule for the SNAP program (59 FR 13044), EPA does not believe that rulemaking procedures are
required to list alternatives as acceptable with no limitations. Such listings do not impose any sanction, nor do
they remove any prior license to use a substance. Consequently, EPA is adding substances to the list of acceptable
alternatives without first requesting comment on new listings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does, however, believe that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required to place any substance on the list of prohibited
substitutes, to list a substance as acceptable only under certain conditions, to list substances as acceptable only
for certain uses, or to remove a substance from either the list of prohibited or acceptable substitutes. Updates to
these lists are published as separate notices of rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency defines a ``substitute'' as any chemical, product substitute, or alternative manufacturing process,
whether existing or new, that could replace a class I or class II substance. Anyone who produces a substitute must provide
the Agency with health and safety studies on the substitute at least 90 days before introducing it into interstate
commerce for significant new use as an alternative. This requirement applies to substitute manufacturers, but may
include importers, formulators or end-users, when they are responsible for introducing a substitute into commerce.

III. Listing of Acceptable Substitutes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This section presents EPA's most recent acceptable listing decisions for class I substitutes in the following industrial
sectors: refrigerants and air conditioning, foam blowing, solvent cleaning, fire suppression and explosion protection;
sterilants; aerosols; adhesives, coatings and inks. These decisions represent substitutes not previously reviewed
in the final rulemaking for SNAP (59 FR 13044; March 18, 1994) and, consequently, add to the lists of acceptable substitutes
under SNAP. For copies of the full list, contact the EPA Stratospheric Protection Hotline at the number listed in Section
V of this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parts A through H below present a detailed discussion of the substitute listing determinations by major use sector.
Tables summarizing listing decisions in this notice are in Appendix A. The comments contained in Appendix A provide
additional information on a substitute, but like the listings themselves, are not regulatory in nature, and thus
they are not mandatory for use of a substitute. Nor should the comments be considered comprehensive with respect to
other legal obligations pertaining to the use of the substitute. However, EPA encourages users of acceptable substitutes
to apply all comments to their use of these substitutes. In many instances, the comments simply allude to sound operating
practices that have already been identified in existing industry and/or building-code standards. Thus, many of
the comments, if adopted, would not require significant changes in existing operating practices for the affected
industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the final rule for the SNAP program, EPA does not believe that rulemaking procedures are required to
list alternatives as acceptable with no limitations. Such listings do not impose any sanction, nor do they remove
any prior license to use a substitute. Consequently, EPA is adding substances to the list of acceptable alternatives

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, however, does believe that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required to place any alternative on the list of
prohibited substitutes, to list a substitute as acceptable only under use restrictions, or to remove a substitute
from either the list of prohibited or acceptable substitutes. Updates to these lists are published as separate notices
of rulemaking in the Federal Register.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
1. Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The refrigeration and air conditioning sector includes all uses of class I and class II substances to produce cooling,
including mechanical and non-mechanical refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat transfer. Please refer to the
final SNAP rule (59 FR 13044) for a more detailed description of this sector.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The refrigeration and air conditioning sector is divided into the following end-uses:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Commercial comfort air conditioning;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;Motor vehicle air conditioning;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Residential air conditioning and heat pumps;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Non-mechanical heat transfer; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Very low temperature refrigeration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
In addition, each end-use is divided into retrofit and new equipment applications. EPA has not necessarily reviewed
substitutes in every end-use for this Notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
EPA has modified the list of end-uses for this sector for this SNAP update. First, EPA has changed the name of the heat
transfer end-use to non-mechanical heat transfer. This change is intended to avoid confusion between systems that
move heat from a cool area to a warm one (mechanical refrigeration) and systems that simply aid the movement of heat
away from warm areas (non-mechanical heat transfer). The second change is that EPA added a new end-use, very low temperature
refrigeration. Substitutes for this end-use have been reviewed since the final rule, and therefore have been added
for this SNAP update. Finally, EPA has also reviewed substitutes for CFC&hyph;13, R&hyph;13B1, and R&hyph;503 industrial
process refrigeration. Please refer to the final SNAP rule (59 FR 13044) for a detailed description of end-uses other
than these three. EPA may continue to add other end-uses in future SNAP updates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Non-mechanical Heat Transfer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed above, this end-use includes all cooling systems that rely on a fluid to remove heat from a heat source
to a cooler area, rather than relying on mechanical refrigeration to move heat from a cool area to a warm one. Generally,
there are two types of systems: systems with fluid pumps, referred to as recirculating coolers, and those that rely
on natural convection currents, known as thermosyphons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Very Low Temperature Refrigeration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Medical freezers, freeze-dryers, and other small appliances require extremely reliable refrigeration cycles.
These systems must meet stringent technical standards that do not normally apply to refrigeration systems. They
usually have very small charges. Because they operate at very high vapor pressures, and because performance is critically
affected by any charge loss, standard maintenance for these systems tends to reduce leakage to a level considerably
below that for other types of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.

c. CFC&hyph;13, R&hyph;13B1, and R&hyph;503 Industrial Process Refrigeration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This end-use differs from other types of industrial refrigeration only in the extremely low temperature regimes
that are required. Although some substitutes may work in both these extremely low temperatures and in systems designed
to use R&hyph;502, they are acceptable only for this end-use because of global warming and atmospheric lifetime concerns.
These concerns are discussed more fully below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Corrections from the March 18, 1994 FRM
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the FRM, the components of two refrigerants, R&hyph;404A and R&hyph;507, were inadvertently reversed. R&hyph;507
consists of HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a and R&hyph;404A consists of HFC&hyph;125, HFC&hyph;143a, and HFC&hyph;134a.
These blends were listed as acceptable for the same end-uses, so the reversal had no effect on the acceptable status
of either refrigerant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also in the FRM, EPA listed HFC&hyph;134a as acceptable in several CFC&hyph;12 end-uses. In the descriptive text,
EPA wrote ``while HFC&hyph;134a is compatible with most existing refrigeration and air conditioning equipment
parts, it is not compatible with mineral oils currently used in such systems. An ester-based lubricant should be used
rather than mineral oils.'' EPA's intention was to alert users to the need to use lubricants other than current mineral
oils, rather than to recommend a particular type of new oil. While it remains true that mineral oils are incompatible
with HFC&hyph;134a, it is not true that polyol ester oils are the only replacement. Polyalkylene glycol oils are also
available, and are in fact the predominant choice of the automobile manufacturers. Therefore, the portion of each
listing for HFC&hyph;1234a should have read ``An appropriate ester-based, polyalkylene glycol-based, or other
type of lubricant should be used.'' In addition, specifically in the Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning end-use the listing
for HFC&hyph;134a should have included the recommendation to consult the original equipment manufacturer or the
retrofit kit manufacturer for further information. For clarity, these changes have been incorporated into the listing
for HFC&hyph;134a in Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning in the NPRM.

3. Substitutes for Refrigerants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Substitutes fall into eight broad categories. Seven of these categories are chemical substitutes used in the same
vapor compression cycle as the ozone-depleting substances being replaced. They include hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrocarbons, refrigerant blends, ammonia, perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and
chlorine systems. The eighth category includes alternative technologies that generally do not rely on vapor compression
cycles. Please refer to the final SNAP rule (59 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FR 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13044) for more discussion of these broad categories.

4. Listing Decisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Acceptable Substitutes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These determinations are based on data submitted to EPA and on the risk screen described in the draft background document
entitled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Refrigerants''. In accordance
with the guiding principles for SNAP, substitutes were compared both to the substance they replace and to each other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the use of all acceptable substitutes presents lower overall risk than the continued use of an ozone-depleting
substance. Not all substitutes will necessarily be appropriate choices for all systems within an end-use. Engineering
decisions must take into account factors such as operating temperatures and pressures, ambient conditions, and
age of equipment, especially during retrofits. For example, substitutes listed under industrial process refrigeration
may be listed as acceptable for retrofits for both CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 systems. However, these substances
exhibit significantly different thermodynamic characteristics, and a substitute for one may not be appropriate
for use as a substitute for the other. EPA believes such decisions are most appropriately made by the equipment owner,
manager, or contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Users of HCFCs should be aware that an acceptability determination shall not be construed to release any user from
compliance with all other regulations pertaining to class II substances. These include: (a) The prohibition against
venting during servicing under section 608, which was effective July 1, 1992; (b) recycling requirements under section
608, which were effective July 13, 1993; (c) section 609 regulations regarding MVACS which were effective August
13, 1992; and (d) the revised production phaseout of class II substances under section 606, which was published on
December 10, 1993. In addition, users of refrigerants that do not contain chlorine should be aware that an acceptability
determination shall not be construed to release any user from compliance with the venting prohibition under section
608(c)(2), which takes effect November 15, 1995, at the latest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substitutes are listed as acceptable by end-use. These substitutes have only been found acceptable for use in the
specific end-uses for which they have been reviewed, as described in this section. Users of blends should be aware
that EPA has evaluated and found acceptable in each case only the specific percentage composition submitted for review;
no others have been evaluated. EPA strongly recommends that users of alternative refrigerants adhere to the provisions
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b contribute to ozone depletion, this blend is considered a transitional
alternative. Regulations regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean Air Act apply
this blend. HCFC&hyph;142b has one of the highest ODPs among the HCFCs. The GWPs of HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b
are somewhat high. Although HCFC&hyph;142b is flammable, the blend is not. After significant leakage, however,
this blend may become weakly flammable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because HCFC&hyph;123 contributes to ozone depletion, it is considered a transitional alternative. Since it poses
much lower ozone-depleting risk than continued use of CFCs, EPA has determined that its use is acceptable for certain
end-uses. In addition, HCFC&hyph;123's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than almost all other
alternatives. HCFC&hyph;123 is not flammable. EPA strongly recommends that users of HCFC&hyph;123 adhere to any
requirements provided in ASHRAE Standards 15 and 34. Worker-monitoring studies conducted by EPA demonstrate that
in office building equipment rooms, HCFC&hyph;123's 8-hour time-weighted average concentration can be maintained
at or under 1 ppm (less than the industry-established AEL of 30 ppm), provided that such standards are followed. HCFC&hyph;123
is acceptable for use in commercial building chillers and should pose no hazard in industrial uses.

in new industrial process refrigeration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because HCFC&hyph;123 contributes to ozone depletion, it is considered a transitional alternative. Since it poses
much lower ozone-depleting risk than continued use of CFCs, EPA has determined that its use is acceptable for certain
end-uses. In addition, HCFC&hyph;123's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than almost all other
alternatives. HCFC&hyph;123 is not flammable. EPA strongly recommends that users of HCFC&hyph;123 adhere to any
requirements provided in ASHRAE Standards 15 and 34. Worker-monitoring studies conducted by EPA demonstrate that
in office building equipment rooms, HCFC&hyph;123's 8-hour time-weighted average concentration can be maintained
at or under 1 ppm (less than the industry-established AEL of 30 ppm), provided that such standards are followed. HCFC&hyph;123
is acceptable for use in commercial building chillers and should pose no hazard in industrial uses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This type of refrigeration requires temperatures well below those achieved with R&hyph;502 or HCFC&hyph;22. A limited
number of substitutes have been identified that are capable of meeting technical requirements. These substitutes
all contain components with extremely high GWPS, and EPA is concerned about their potential contribution to global
warming. However, under SNAP, EPA intends to only find those substitutes unacceptable that clearly present greater
overall risk. Given this framework, EPA finds these high-GWP substitutes acceptable. At the same time, EPA strongly
urges industry to develop new alternatives for this end-use that do not contain substances with such high GWPs and
long lifetimes.

 and a lifetime of 280 years. Its GWP is the highest among the HFCs, and its lifetime is exceeded only by the PFCs. EPA believes
HFC&hyph;23 could contribute significantly to global warming. In addition, the long lifetime of HFC&hyph;23 means
any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible. While the current rule issued under section
608 of the CAA does not require recycling and recovery of HFC&hyph;23, or leak repair for systems using HFC&hyph;23,
EPA strongly encourages users to anticipate future rulemakings with voluntary compliance. In particular, EPA urges
users to reduce leakage and recover and recycle HFC&hyph;23 during equipment servicing and upon the retirement of
equipment. HFC&hyph;23 is nonflammable and does not deplete stratospheric ozone.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because HCFC&hyph;22 contributes to ozone depletion, this blend is considered a transitional alternative. Regulations
regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean Air Act apply to this blend. R&hyph;218,
or perfluoropropane, is an extremely long-lived substance with an extremely high GWP. EPA believes this blend could
contribute significantly to global warming. In addition, the long lifetime of R&hyph;218 means any global warming
or other effects would be essentially irreversible. R&hyph;403B is only acceptable as a substitute for this end-use.
The GWP of HCFC&hyph;22 is also somewhat high. Although propane is flammable, the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated
that the blend's composition never becomes flammable. In a proposed rulemaking soon to be issued, EPA intends to propose
R&hyph;403B unacceptable as a substitute for R&hyph;502 in all end-uses because other substitutes have been identified
which do not exhibit such extreme GWPs or lifetimes.

 Both components of this blend exhibit extremely high GWPs and long lifetimes. HFC&hyph;23 has a GWP of 9,000 and a lifetime
of 280 years, and R&hyph;116, perfluoroethane, has a GWP of 9,000 and a lifetime of 10,000 years. EPA believes this
blend could significantly contribute to global warming if allowed to escape refrigeration systems. In addition,
the long lifetimes of R&hyph;116 and HFC&hyph;23 mean any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible.
While the current rule issued under section 608 of the CAA does not require recycling and recovery of this blend, or

A smooth transition to the use of substitutes strongly depends on the continued purity of the recycled CFC&hyph;12

To address this increased risk, EPA is proposing several use conditions on the use of all motor vehicle air conditioning

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some situations, HCFC&hyph;22 may be used as a retrofit refrigerant in bus and rail car air conditioning systems
originally designed to use CFC&hyph;12. In addition, while HCFC&hyph;22 is the primary refrigerant in these uses,
EPA is listing it as an acceptable substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new systems in order to remove confusion about its
usefulness. Please note that HCFC&hyph;22 is only acceptable in motor vehicles other than automobiles. Design differences
render HCFC&hyph;22 ineffective in cars. In fact, HCFC&hyph;22 may damage automobile air conditioners. HCFC&hyph;22
does contribute to ozone depletion and will therefore be phased out according to the accelerated schedule (published
12/10/93, 58 FR 65018). It is therefore covered by regulations issued under section 608 of the CAA. HCFC&hyph;22 is

EPA did not review substitutes for this end-use as part of the SNAP FRM, nor did it propose to include this end-use in
the refrigeration and air conditioning sector in the NPRM (58 FR 28094). However, the Agency has developed a better
understanding of the volumes likely to be used as coolants, and this new information has led EPA to reconsider its earlier
position that heat transfer systems constitute small uses. Therefore, EPA has included this end-use within the refrigeration
and air conditioning sector. In a subsequent proposal, EPA plans to propose narrowed use limits for several substitutes
in this end-use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This type of refrigeration requires temperatures well below those achieved with R&hyph;502 or HCFC&hyph;22. Because
these systems are used for purposes such as freezing blood or for simulating extreme conditions for testing, extremely
low leakage rakes are essential. A limited number of substitutes have been identified that are capable of meeting
technical requirements. These substitutes all contain components with extremely high GWPS, and EPA is concerned
about their potential contribution to global warming. However, under SNAP, EPA intends to only find those substitutes
unacceptable that clearly present greater overall risk. Given this framework, EPA finds these high-GWP substitutes
acceptable. At the same time, EPA strongly urges industry to develop new alternatives for this end-use that do not
contain substances with such high GWPs and long lifetimes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HFC&hyph;23 has an extremely high GWP of 9000 and a lifetime of 280 years. Its GWP is the highest among the HFCs, and its
lifetime is exceeded only by the PFCs. EPA believes it could contribute significantly to global warming. In addition,
the long lifetime of HFC&hyph;23 means any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible. While
the current rule issued under section 608 of the CAA does not require recycling and recovery of HFC&hyph;23, or leak
repair for systems using HFC&hyph;23, EPA strongly encourages users to anticipate future rulemakings with voluntary
compliance. In particular, EPA urges users to reduce leakage and recover and recycle HFC&hyph;23 during equipment
servicing and upon the retirement of equipment. HFC&hyph;23 is nonflammable and does not deplete ozone.

 Because HCFC&hyph;22 contributes to ozone depletion, this blend is considered a transitional alternative. Regulations
regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean Air Act apply to this blend. R&hyph;218,
or perfluoropropane, is an extremely long-lived substance with an extremely high GWP. EPA believes this blend could
significantly contribute to global warming. In addition, the long lifetimes of R&hyph;218 means global warming
and other effects would be essentially irreversible. R&hyph;403B is only acceptable as a substitute for the refrigerants
listed above. The GWP of HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b are also somewhat high. Although propane is flammable,
the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated that the blend's composition never becomes flammable. In a proposed
rulemaking soon to be issued, EPA intends to propose R&hyph;403B unacceptable as a substitute for R&hyph;502 in all
end-uses because other substitutes have been identified which do not exhibit such extreme GEPs or lifetimes.

PFC Blend Alpha, which contains HFC&hyph;23 and R&hyph;116, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;13, R&hyph;13B1,
and R&hyph;503 in retrofitted and new very low temperature refrigeration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Both components of this blend exhibit extremely high GWPs and long lifetimes. HFC&hyph;23 has a GWP of 9,000 and a lifetime
of 280 years, and R&hyph;116, perfluoroethane, has a GWP of 9,000 and a lifetime of 10,000 years. EPA believes this
blend could significantly contribute to global warming if allowed to escape refrigeration systems. In addition,
the long lifetimes of R&hyph;116 and HFC&hyph;23 mean any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible.
While the current rule issued under section 608 of the CAA does not require recycling and recovery of this blend, or
leak repair for systems using it, EPA strongly encourages users to anticipate future rulemakings with voluntary
compliance. In particular, EPA urges users to reduce leakage and recover and recycle HFC&hyph;23 during equipment
servicing and upon the retirement of equipment. This blend is nonflammable and does not deplete ozone.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Electroset Manufacturing Technology is an acceptable substitute for CFC&hyph;11 blown rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proprietary manufacturing process, developed by the U.S. Navy, transforms organic casting resins into electrosettable
foaming compounds. These compounds are made electrically semiconductive with the addition of electrically polarizable
particles, and if necessary, an electrically conductive fluid. This process enables foam manufacturers to electrically
accelerate the speed at which they set (i.e., harden) and cure (i.e. solidify). Other characteristics such as density,
compressibility, adhesion, and shear strength can also be electrically controlled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Potential health and environmental risks for this technology are considered similar to or less than those of other
acceptable substitutes for this end-use. Risk is expected to vary based on the quantity of electrically polarizable
particles added in the polymer and whether other electrically conductive fluids are added to the formulation. Of
the six potential electrically foaming agents reviewed by the Agency, none represented a significant risk under
the SNAP criteria for evaluation. Adequate workplace precautions such as workplace ventilation were presumed.
For additional detail see, ``SNAP Evaluation for Electroset Technology.''

 Methylene chloride is a non-ozone-depleting and non-global warming alternative blowing agent. Nevertheless,
it does pose potential health and safety concerns. In addition to occupational and worker safety standards, some
local and regional restrictions apply to the use of methylene chloride. To assess risks in the Polyolefin foam sector,
EPA used data collected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for the proposed revision of
the permissible exposure level (PEL) for methylene chloride. The Agency's estimate for total population risk for
methylene chloride was based on average plant emissions derived from OSHA's analysis, and while not negligible,
was within the range of existing Agency decisions on acceptable risk. For further detail, refer to the SNAP background
document entitled, ``Risk Screen on the Use of Methylene Chloride in Polyolefin Foams for Class I Ozone-Depleting
Substances: Foams, June, 1994.'' Users of this substitute should note that methylene chloride will be subject to
future controls for hazardous air pollutants under Title III section 112 of the Clean Air Act.

1. Weight and Volume Equivalence of Halon Substitutes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the SNAP Rulemaking published March 18, 1994 (59 FR 13043), EPA included weight and volume equivalence data in the
discussion of halon substitutes. This data was derived from either of two sources. EPA used manufacturer data when
available, otherwise the data was taken from the background document entitled ``Characterization of Risk from the
Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Fire Extinguishing and Explosion Protection (Halon
Substitutes).'' While this data was presented in the Rulemaking for informational purposes only to establish a relative
concept, the variability of methodologies for calculating these values has generated some confusion in the regulated
and user community. Therefore, at EPA's request, the Technical Committee of the Halon Alternatives Research Corporation
has developed an agreed upon set of data for determining weight and volume equivalence of halon substitutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following table presents weight and volume equivalents for certain halon substitutes when compared to Halon
1301. The equivalents were calculated using a single, fuel-specific design concentration (heptane); therefore,
they do not represent the exact weight or volume of the agent needed to protect any specific space against any specific
hazard. The information used to calculate the equivalents was obtained from agent manufacturers and NFPA 2001, ``Standard
on Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing Systems.'' Equivalents are included for general comparison and informational
purposes only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fire suppression agents must be evaluated in the context of the fire extinguishing system equipment with which they
are used. Design concentration, and weight and volume equivalents are only meaningful when evaluated in specific
system hardware configurations. This is especially important when comparing storage volume where storage container
fill density varies with the equipment used. Agent fire suppression performance will vary with the system used and
the detailed design of the system. Therefore, fire suppression agent manufacturers do not generally recommend design
concentration as these are also a function of the system hardware in which they are used. Hence, these data are provided
for general guidance only and do not reflect a recommendation for system design or a basis for rigorous quantitative
comparison.

2. Use of CFCs and HCFCs in Portable Extinguishers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this notice, EPA is clarifying the relationship between CAAA section 610 and section 612 regulations. Under section
610(b) (58 FR 4768; January 15, 1993), CFCs are banned from sale or distribution in all portable fire extinguishers.
Under section 610(d) (58 FR 69637, December 30, 1993), HCFCs in pressurized dispensers are banned from sale or distribution.
However, section 619(d) excludes HCFCs which are part of an installed `system,' and therefore exempted total flooding
systems and those streaming applications which incorporate fixed, automatic systems (58 FR 69646). Further, section
610(d) only allows the sale of a portable fire extinguisher containing HCFCs where other agents are not suitable for
the intended applications. Suitability includes the commercial availability of the agent and the ability of the
agent to suppress a fire in progress without damaging the equipment requiring protection (58 FR 69648). Because alternatives
are available for residential consumer uses, section 610(d) banned the sale and use of HCFCs in portable fire extinguishers
for residential consumer applications. However, in commercial (including industrial and military) settings,
the variety of hazards are too broad to make a standard rulemaking, and therefore under section 610(d) EPA has established
industry-based mechanisms for controlling the sale of HCFCs to commercial users and owners of watercraft and aircraft.
Because section 610(d) already bans CFCs in portable fire extinguishers and HCFCs in residential applications,
it is not necessary for them to be listed as unacceptable under SNAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HCFCs and HCFC Blends that are listed as acceptable under SNAP, but that are not acceptable under section 610(d)
in residential streaming applications are: HCFC&hyph;123, HCFC&hyph;124, [HCFC Blend] B, [HCFC Blend] C, and [HCFC
Blend] D.

(a) HCFC&hyph;124._HCFC&hyph;124 is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFC&hyph;124 has an ODP of 0.02, a 100-year GWP of 440 and an atmospheric lifetime of 7 years. Its extinguishment concentration,
based on cup burner tests, is 7.0 per cent, while its cardiotoxic level (LOAEL) is 2.5 per cent in the dog, with no effect
(NOAEL) apparent at 1.0 per cent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Actual exposures were assessed using personal monitoring devices, and the Agency concludes that likely exposure
levels from its use as a streaming agent do not exceed safe levels when used in a well ventilated area. The manufacturer
of portable extinguishers using these agents should include cautionary language on the label indicating the need
for ventilation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This agent is subject to regulations under section 610(d) of the CAA, which stipulates that HCFCs may only be used in
portable fire extinguishers where other commercially available agents are not as effective for the fire hazard.
Under section 610(d), HCFCs may not be used in residential extinguishers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(b) [HCFC Blend] C._[HCFC Blend] C is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This agent is a proprietary blend of HCFC&hyph;123, HCFC&hyph;124, HCFC&hyph;134a, and an additive. The cardiotoxic
LOAEL and NOAEL for HCFC&hyph;123 is, respectively, 2.0 per cent and 1.0 per cent; the LOAEL and NOAEL for HCFC&hyph;124
is 2.5 per cent and 1.0 per cent; and the LOAEL and NOAEL for HCFC&hyph;134a is 8.0 per cent and 4.0 per cent respectively.
While the manufacturer may, in the future, conduct personal monitoring studies of actual exposure levels of this
agent, previous studies conducted for pure HCFC&hyph;123 and for pure HCFC&hyph;124 have shown that exposure in
the breathing zone does not exceed cardiotoxicity values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ODP of both HCFC&hyph;123 and HCFC&hyph;124 is 0.02 while HCFC&hyph;134a has no ODP since it contains no chlorine.
The respective GWP values for HCFC&hyph;123, HCFC&hyph;124, and HCFC&hyph;134a are 90, 440, and 1200, relative
to CO

 This blend is comprised of HCFC&hyph;123 plus a proprietary additive, and is intended for large outdoor uses such
as wheeled extinguishers, HCFC&hyph;123 is currently listed as acceptable for use in non-residential streaming
applications. This agent is subject to regulations under section 610(d) of the CAA, which stipulates that HCFCs may
only be used in portable fire extinguishers where other commercially available agents are not as effective for the
fire hazard. Under section 610(d), HCFCs may not be used in residential extinguishers.

(d) Gelled Halocarbon/Dry Chemical Suspension (formerly Powdered Aerosol B)._Gelled Halocarbon/Dry Chemical
Suspension is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This class of agents is comprised of a variety of blends developed for particular markets. Each blend contains one
or more halocarbons, a dry chemical, and a gel which keeps the powder and gas uniform. Both the halocarbon and the dry
chemical act on the fire, while the gel is consumed by the fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's acceptability listing is extended to any blend comprised of a halocarbon with a cardiotoxic LOAEL of at least
2.0 per cent, in combination with a dry chemical or multipurpose dry chemical that is currently widely used, including
monoammonium phosphate (ABC powder), potassium bicarbonate (Purple K powder), and sodium bicarbonate. This listing
decision also includes ammonium polyphosphate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer of this technology proposes using several different halocarbons singly and in blends, in combination
with one of several dry chemicals or multipurpose dry chemical powders. The halocarbons included in the SNAP submission
include HFC&hyph;227ea, HFC&hyph;125, HFC&hyph;134a, and HFC&hyph;125 blended with HFC&hyph;134a. The cardiotoxic
LOAEL and NOAEL of HFC&hyph;227ea is, respectively, 10.5 per cent of 9.0 per cent; the LOAEL and NOAEL of HFC&hyph;125
is 10.0 per cent and 7.5 per cent; and the LOAEL and NOAEL of HFC&hyph;134a is 8.0 per cent and 4.0 per cent respectively.
Previous personal monitoring tests of streaming agents using pure HCFC&hyph;123 (LOAEL 2.0 per cent; NOAEL 1.0 per
cent) and HCFC&hyph;124 (LOAEL 2.5 per cent; NOAEL 1.0 per cent) indicate that actual exposure to the breathing zone
does not exceed these values. Such tests with agents which pose greater risk of cardiosensitization indicate that
HFC&hyph;227ea, HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;134a can also be used safely in well-ventilated areas. In addition,
the quantity of the halocarbons in this technology is approximately half of what a pure halocarbon extinguisher would
contain and thus there is a built-in margin of safety as it relates to cardiotoxicity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While all of the proposed halocarbons have no ODP, the GWP and atmospheric lifetime of HFC&hyph;227ea is 2050 and 31
years; of HCF&hyph;125 is 3400 and 41 years; and of HCF&hyph;134a is 1200 and 16 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The dry chemical powders proposed by the manufacturer include ammonium polyphosphate, monoammonium phosphate
(MAP), potassium bicarbonate, and sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate was among the original dry chemical extinguishers,
followed by potassium bicarbonate and monoammonium phosphate which were developed in the 1960s. Thus, these dry
chemical agents have been in use for decades. These powders have been considered generally nontoxic, although if
not used according to manufacturers directions they can cause temporary breathing difficulty during and immediately
after discharge. Discharge in large quantities may decrease visibility. These powders typically have particle
sizes of less than 10 microns up to 75 microns, with most being optimized at 20 to 25 microns. Ammonium polyphosphate
has previously been used as a fire retardant additive to products and coatings, and the manufacturer is introducing
it for use as a streaming agent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monoammonium phosphate, commonly known as ABC powder, is a general purpose agent which can be used for class A, B and
C fires. However, it is corrosive on hard surfaces. Potassium bicarbonate (Purple K) and sodium bicarbonate cannot
be used on class A fires, but are used for specific class B and C applications, generally in the commercial sector. Ammonium
polyphosphate is most suitable for military uses, because it is not corrosive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An initial assessment of inhalation toxicology of fine particulates indicates that some risk is posed when the particles
are below a certain size compared to the mass per cubic meter in air. Particle sizes less than 10 to 15 microns and a mass
above the ACGIH nuisance dust levels raise concerns which need to be further studied should these agents be used in
a total flooding application. However, in a streaming application, it is unlikely that the exposure level will exceed
ACGIH dust levels.

The particle size distribution for these powders was analyzed with a Micromeretics Sedigraph using Sedisperse A&hyph;11
as the settling medium. Mesh of various sizes ranging from 40 mesh (420 microns) to 325 mesh (45 microns) is used to filter
the powders into a pan, thus leaving a `pan fraction' of powder particles which are smaller than 45 microns. A sample
of the sediment in the pan is mixed in the Sedisperse medium, which is a heavy, high viscosity fluid. An X-ray beam shines
through the sample and counts the particles as they drift down.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using this method, 50 to 75 per cent of the monoammonium phosphate is smaller than 45 microns. Of that portion which
is smaller than 45 microns, the median particle size is 20 microns, with 19.5 per cent of the particles being smaller
than 10 microns, and 3.0 per cent being smaller than five microns. Thus, up to 15 per cent (.75&times;.195) of the entire
MAP product is smaller than 10 microns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventy-four to 88 per cent of the potassium bicarbonate is smaller than 45 microns, with a median size of the pan fraction
being 17.4 microns. With 28.4 per cent of the pan fraction being ten microns in size, then up to 25 per cent (.284&times;88)
of the total potassium bicarbonate product is under ten microns. 11.3 per cent of the pan fraction is under five microns.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seventy-five to ninety per cent of the sodium bicarbonate is retained in the pan, and therefore is smaller than 45 microns.
The median particle size of the pan fraction is 15.0 microns. With 12.2 per cent of the pan fraction being smaller than
ten microns, then 11 per cent of the total product is smaller than ten microns. One per cent of the pan fraction is smaller
than five microns.

The manufacturer's data indicate that there are two mixtures of ammonium polyphosphate. The P40 mixture has a particle
size distribution with 50% of the particles less than 10 microns. The intended market for this agent is military applications.
The P30 mixture has a distribution with 20% of particles less than 10 microns and 50% less than 30 microns. The intended
market for this agent is for use in domestic and industrial kitchens.

 is stored in tanks as a liquified compressed gas mixture. A tube in the tank draws the liquid mixture from the bottom
for use as a sterilant. By Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations, the tank can be filled with liquid to only

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to form this vapor, the percentage of EtO in the mixture is now greater than 8.5 per cent. As liquid leaves the tank, the

This results in a liquid mixture that grows increasingly EtO-rich until the liquid is fully depleted. At a certain

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two methods of supply control effectively address these problems. The first uses one-tank-per-cycle ``unit dose''
tanks. The second uses larger, multiple-cycle tanks and a weight-sensing system.

Unit dose tanks hold only enough EtO/CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for a single sterilization cycle. Unit dose tanks are available for several sizes of sterilizer chambers. After a
cycle, the depleted tank is replaced with a fresh one. Using all of the gas in one discharge avoids the risks of flammability
and ineffective sterilization which occur in multiple-cycle tanks. However, replacing the tank after each cycle
is inconvenient. It also increases the risk of accidental exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A weight-sensing system uses the tank for more than one sterilization cycle. To be safe, such a system must sense when
a tank is depleted, before either the liquid mixture becomes flammable or when only ineffective vapors remain in the
tank headspace.

For many gas mixtures, a pressure gauge can indicate the amount of gas in a tank. But for EtO/CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 systems, tank pressure does not change appreciably during tank depletion. As the liquid is depleted, more CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 fills the headspace and keeps the pressure almost constant. But as a tank of EtO/CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is depleted, the weight of the liquid mixture decreases steadily.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A weight-sensing system monitors the weight of a tank as it is depleted. Before the increasingly EtO-rich liquid in
the tank becomes flammable, the system switches to a fresh tank. The depleted tank can then be replaced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such systems are designed with numerous safety features to prevent accidental exposure. One drawback is that, when
depleted, a tank still contains a portion of the original EtO/CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

Under Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Agency is required to regulate any of the 189 hazardous air
pollutants (HAPs). Ethylene oxide is a HAP, and the user is alerted to follow all upcoming regulations concerning
the use of ethylene oxide, whether used alone or in a blend. Manufacturers and users are alerted to the fact that the
Agency has issued a Proposed Rulemaking which includes EtO used in all sterilizers except hospital systems (59 FR
10591, March 7, 1994).

I. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program have been approved by the
Office of Management and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520),
and assigned OMB control number 2501&hyph;0013. This interim rule does not contain additional information collection
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) was enacted under title II (42 U.S.C. 12701&hyph;12839) of the Cranston-Gonzalez
National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990). Implementing regulations
for the HOME Program are at 24 CFR part 92. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA 1992) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) included
a substantial number of amendments to the HOME program. These amendments were implemented in rules published on December
22, 1992 (57 FR 60960), June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34130), and April 19, 1994 (59 FR 18626). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (MHPDRA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;233, approved April
11, 1994) included an additional number of amendments to the HOME Program. The following discussion, arranged according
to the sequence of the MHPDRA sections, summarizes the changes made to the HOME program regulation in this interim
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 201 of MHPDRA amends section 104(2) of NAHA to allow governors to designate State agencies or instrumentalities
of the State (e.g., housing finance agencies or housing authorities) to administer HOME Program funds. Prior to this
change, a subrecipient agreement was required between the State and its instrumentality to administer the HOME funds.
This amendment provides greater flexibility to designate such an organization to run the program and the definition
of State in &sect;92.2 is amended accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 202 of MHPDRA amends section 214(1) of NAHA which required that at least 90 percent of the HOME funds invested
in rental housing be for units occupied by families below 60 percent of median income. This amendment changes the requirement
to say that at least 90 percent of the units assisted, and in the case of tenant-based rental assistance, the families
assisted be below 60 percent of median income. This amendment, as implemented through &sect;92.216, will simplify
the targeting requirement since it is easier to count units than funds invested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 203 of MHPDRA amends section 215(b) of NAHA in two ways. The first change is the elimination of the ``first-time''
designation for homebuyers. The HCDA 1992 amendment broadened the eligibility of ``first-time'' homebuyers to
include almost all low-income homebuyers. By eliminating the designation, participating jurisdictions will not
have to document the statutory category under which income-eligible homebuyers qualify. The change will also conform
the HOME Program to the CDBG Program, which does not restrict homebuyer assistance to first-time homebuyers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second change would permit participating jurisdictions to use funds recaptured from the sale of homebuyer units
for any eligible HOME cost. The provision formerly limited the use of the recaptured funds to assistance for additional
first-time homebuyers. This change will effect the use of current and future recaptured funds. Conforming changes
have been made to &sect;&sect;92.2, 92.61(b)(4), 92.150(b)(4), 92.205(a)(1), 92.206(b), 92.214(a)(7), 92.254(a),
and 92.354 to implement the new homebuyer requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 204 of MHPDRA amends section 220(a) of NAHA to effect a flat 25 percent match on all funds drawn down for HOME
projects or tenant-based rental assistance. This provision eliminates the 30 percent match of funds drawn down for
new construction. This new, lower match rate will be applied to all Fiscal Year 1993 funds currently expended or future
year funds drawn down for eligible HOME activities, and &sect;92.218 has been changed accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new environmental provisions make three amendments to section 288 of NAHA which are implemented for the HOME Program
by &sect;92.352, for Subpart M_HOME Funds for Indian Tribes at &sect;92.633, and also by revisions to HUD regulations
in 24 CFR part 58, which govern the assumption of environmental responsibilities by recipients under the HOME program
and other programs with similar statutory authority for recipient environmental reviews. The first amendment provides
for assumption of HUD's environmental review responsibilities by all jurisdictions receiving assistance under
the HOME Program, not just participating jurisdictions, as well as Indian tribes and insular areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second amendment to Section 288 makes HOME environmental review procedures consistent with the procedures under
the Community Development Block Grant and McKinney Act homeless assistance programs with regard to States' responsibilities.
Where a State makes funds available to a unit of general local government, the State would perform the release of funds
function otherwise performed by HUD, and local governments would assume the responsibility for performing environmental
reviews. To the extent that the State would be using the HOME funds directly, HUD would approve the request for release
of funds.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, a new paragraph, &sect;58.77(d), is added to part 58, which adds the new statutory provisions for monitoring,
training, and termination or suspension of assumption of review responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to 24 CFR part 58 in this interim rule contain changes consistent with the above changes in part 92. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Section 305 of MHPDRA amends Section 1011 of the HCDA 1992 to provide that for purposes of environmental
review, decisionmaking and action, certain grants for lead-based paint hazard reduction and abatement shall be
treated as assistance under the HOME Investment Partnership Act and shall be subject to HUD's regulations implementing
section 288 of that Act. In other words, recipients of these lead-based paint grants will assume environmental responsibilities
to the same extent as recipients under the HOME program and will be subject to 24 CFR part 58. The grants covered by this
provision are lead-based paint hazard reduction grants under section 1011, as well as grants to States and units of
general local government for abatement of lead-based paint and lead dust hazards pursuant to title II of the Departments
of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992 (approved
October 28, 1991, Pub. L. 102&hyph;139), (92 App. Act). Accordingly, &sect;58.1(c) is amended to reflect the applicability
of part 58 to these lead-based paint grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 208 of MHPDRA creates a new section 290 of NAHA which permits the Secretary to waive certain statutory provisions
for PJs that are in federally-declared disaster areas under title IV of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and
Emergency Assistance Act and that will be using HOME funds to address damage. However, the Secretary may not waive
requirements related to public notice of funding availability, nondiscrimination, fair housing, labor standards,
environmental standards and low-income housing affordability. With regard to low-income housing affordability,
projects must meet the occupancy rent and periods of affordability provisions outlined in &sect;&sect;92.252 and
92.254. It is the Department's intent to provide waivers on other HOME requirements based on the circumstances of
a particular disaster, tailoring the waivers to the needs of the participating jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is making a technical correction to &sect;92.211(a)(2) to reflect the 1992 amendments to the Section
6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937. Selection policies and criteria for a tenant-based rental assistance program
funded by HOME are considered reasonably related to the Federal preference rules if, at least, 50% of the families
would meet the Federal preferences. The change reduces the proportion of families required to meet the Federal preferences
from 70% to 50%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is amending &sect;92.254(a) to include the requirement that homeownership under a lease-purchase
agreement, in conjunction with a homebuyer program, must occur within 36 months. This addition serves to integrate
policy guidance enunciated previously to the field into the rule. The Department believes that 36 months should be
ample time for a homebuyer to resolve any outstanding credit problems, to complete homeowner education courses,
or build up sufficient equity for homeownership (especially since HOME funds can be used for down-payment assistance).
Lease-purchase arrangements in connection with homebuyer programs are not subject to the same occupancy and rental
restrictions as are HOME rental projects and, therefore, the Department is concerned that any longer lease period
would be contrary to the statutory requirements governing HOME rental projects. The Department would appreciate
any comment regarding this regulatory amendment, whether the 36 month period is too long or not long enough or whether
the time period should be determined by the PJ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HOME Program regulations published April 19, 1994 made a change to &sect;92.252(a)(2) designed to prevent ``Low
HOME Rents,'' as calculated, to be higher than ``High HOME Rents'' as a result of fair market rents in some regions.
The change was made to correct this problem by indicating that if the low HOME rents were higher than the high HOME rents
that the figure for the lower rent would be used for all HOME units. That change, however, has been interpreted as limiting
the method for calculation of low HOME rents, which was not intended. Revisions have been made to &sect;92.252(a)(2)(iii)
to clarify this point.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule also makes clarifying changes to three cross-cutting program provisions in the HOME rule. First,
this interim rule amends &sect;92.257, ``Religious organizations,'' to remove a reference relating to control
of wholly secular entities established by ``primarily religious organizations'' to rehabilitate or construct
housing which will therefore not be owned by such primarily religious organizations. The Department recognizes
the important role served by religious groups in providing lower income housing. This change conforms the rule to
the same principles and tests applied in the Community Development Block Grant regulations at &sect;570.200(j)
and in the section 202 program for elderly housing assistance. This clarification is intended to indicate the availability
of no lesser role in the HOME program for entities established by a ``primarily religious organization,'' a term equivalent
to what the United States Supreme Court describes as a ``pervasively sectarian institution,'' one in which ``religion
is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, this interim rule revises &sect;92.353(e) to set out the requirement that HOME participating jurisdictions
must comply with the requirements of a Residential Antidisplacement and Relocation Assistance Plan (Plan). The
change reflects a statutory amendment to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy made by Section 220(b)
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. A participating jurisdiction with a Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) must follow a Plan identical to its CDBG Plan. A participating jurisdiction that is not a CDBG grantee
must follow a Plan that meets the requirements of the applicable CDBG regulation (24 CFR 570.606(c) for a local jurisdiction
and &sect;570.488(c) for States). A certification requirement related to this provision is also added to &sect;92.10(c)(4).
On July 1, 1994, HUD published a proposed rule at 24 CFR part 43 (59 FR 34300) describing proposed changes to Plan requirements.
The deadline for public comments was August 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this interim rule also amends &sect;92.354(a)(2), regarding Davis-Bacon Act applicability. The change
is intended to make clear that construction contracts covering 12 or more units, disregarding the number of projects
involved, are subject to Davis-Bacon requirements. Also, dividing a single project into multiple construction
contracts for purposes of avoiding Davis-Bacon requirements is not permitted.

Justification for Interim Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that this interim rule should be adopted without the delay occasioned by requiring
prior notice and comment. This interim rule simply constitutes the implementation of statutory language with the
exercise of little or no discretion on the part of the Department and makes a number of clarifying changes to existing
provisons. As such, prior notice and comment are unnecessary under 24 CFR Part 10. This rule is being published as an
interim rule and not as a final rule because the HOME program regulation at 24 CFR part 92 has not yet been issued as a final
rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office
of the Rules Docket Clerk.

Regulatory Planning and Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed and approved in accordance with Executive Order 12866, issued by the President
on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Any changes to the interim rule resulting from this review are
available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Impact on Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the undersigned hereby certifies that this
interim rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because jurisdictions
that are statutorily eligible to receive formula allocations are relatively larger cities, counties or States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994
(59 FR 20424) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Federalism Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel has determined, as the Designated Official for HUD under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federalism,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that this interim rule does not have federalism implications concerning the division of local, State, and federal
responsibilities. While the HOME Program interim rule amended by this interim rule was determined to be a rule with
federalism implications and the Department submitted a Federalism Assessment concerning the interim rule to OMB,
this amending rule only makes limited adjustments to the interim rule and does not significantly affect any of the
factors considered in the Federalism Assessment for the interim rule.

Impact on the Family
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the designated official under Executive Order 12606, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Family,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has determined that this interim rule would not have significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general
well-being. Assistance provided under this interim rule can be expected to support family values, by helping families
achieve security and independence; by enabling them to live in decent, safe, and sanitary housing; and by giving them
the means to live independently in mainstream American society. This interim rule would not, however, affect the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
institution
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the family, which is requisite to coverage by the Order. Even if this interim rule had the necessary family impact,
it would not be subject to further review under the Order, since the provision of assistance under this interim rule
is required by statute, and is not subject to agency discretion.

Responsibility for monitoring and training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) At least once every three years, HUD intends to conduct in-depth monitoring of the environmental activities performed
by recipients that have assumed responsibilities for environmental review, decisionmaking, and action under this
part. Limited monitoring of these environmental activities will be conducted during each program monitoring site
visit. If through limited or in-depth monitoring of these environmental activities or by other means, HUD becomes
aware of any environmental deficiencies, HUD may take one or more of the following actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In the case of problems found during limited monitoring, HUD may schedule in-depth monitoring at an earlier date
or may schedule in-depth monitoring more frequently; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) HUD may require attendance by recipient staff at HUD sponsored or approved training, which will be provided periodically
at various locations around the country; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) HUD may refuse to accept the certifications of environmental compliance on subsequent grants; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) HUD may suspend or terminate the recipient's assumption of the environmental review responsibility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) HUD may initiate sanctions, corrective actions or other remedies provided in program regulations or agreements
or contracts with the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) HUD's responsibilities and action under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not be construed to limit or reduce
any responsibility assumed by a recipient with respect to any particular release of funds under this part. Whether
or not HUD takes action under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Certifying Officer remains the responsible Federal
official under &sect;58.17 with respect to projects and activities for which the Certifying Officer has submitted
a RROF and certification under this part.

(1) HOME funds may be used by a participating jurisdiction to provide incentives to develop and support affordable
rental housing and homeownership affordability through the acquisition (including assistance to homebuyers),
new construction, reconstruction, or moderate or substantial rehabilitation of non-luxury housing with suitable
amenities, including real property acquisition, site improvements, conversion, demolition, and other expenses,
including financing costs, relocation expenses of any displaced persons, families, businesses, or organizations,
to provide tenant-based rental assistance, including security deposits; to provide payment of reasonable administrative
and planning costs; and to provide for the payment of operating expenses of community housing development organizations.
The housing must be permanent or transitional housing, and includes permanent housing for disabled homeless persons,
and single-room occupancy housing. The specific eligible costs for these activities are set forth in &sect;&sect;92.206
through 92.209.

(2) The participating jurisdiction selects families in accordance with written tenant selection policies and criteria
that are consistent with the purposes of providing housing to very low- and low-income families and are reasonably
related to preference rules established under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.).
Selection policies and criteria meet the ``reasonably related'' requirement if at least 50% of the families assisted
qualify, or would qualify in the near future without tenant-based rental assistance, for one of the three Federal
preferences under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937. These are families that occupy substandard housing
(including families that are homeless or living in a shelter for homeless families); families that are paying more
than 50 percent of (gross) family income for rent; or families that are involuntarily displaced. The participating
jurisdiction may select low-income families currently residing in units that are designated for rehabilitation
or acquisition under the participating jurisdiction's HOME program without requiring that the family meet the written
tenant selection policies and criteria. Families so selected may use the tenant-based assistance in the rehabilitation
or acquired unit or in other qualified housing.

HOME funds may not be provided to primarily religious organizations, such as churches, for any activity including
secular activities. In addition, HOME funds may not be used to rehabilitate or construct housing owned by primarily
religious organizations or to assist primarily religious organizations in acquiring housing. However, HOME funds
may be used by a secular entity to acquire housing from a primarily religious organization, and a primarily religious
entity may transfer title to property to a wholly secular entity and the entity may participate in the HOME program
in accordance with the requirements of this part. The entity may be an existing or newly established entity, which
may be an entity established by the religious organization. The completed housing project must be used exclusively
by the owner entity for secular purposes, available to all persons regardless of religion. In particular, there must
be no religious or membership criteria for tenants of the property.

(2) The contract for construction must contain these wage provisions if HOME funds are used for any project costs (as
defined in &sect;92.206), including construction or nonconstruction costs, of housing with 12 or more HOME-assisted
units. When HOME funds are only used to assist homebuyers to acquire single-family housing, and not for any other project
costs, the wage provisions apply to the construction of the housing if there is a written agreement with the owner or
developer of the housing that HOME funds will be used to assist homebuyers to buy the housing and the construction contract
covers 12 or more housing units to be purchased with HOME assistance. The wage provisions apply to any construction
contract that includes a total of 12 or more HOME-assisted units, whether one or more than one project is covered by
the construction contract. Once they are determined to be applicable, the wage provisions must be contained in the
construction contract so as to cover all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of the entire project,
including portions other than the assisted units. Arranging multiple construction contracts within a single project
for the purpose of avoiding the wage provisions is not permitted.

The FAA has authority to assess civil penalties not to exceed $50,000 for certain violations of the Federal Aviation
Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. App. 1301 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), the FAA's regulations (14 CFR parts 1&hyph;199), and certain other statutes and orders. (49 U.S.C. App. 1471(a)(3)).
In the case of persons other than those acting in the capacity of a pilot, flight engineer, mechanic, or repairman,
the procedures for civil penalty assessment actions are those contained in &sect;13.16 and part 13, subpart G of the
FAA's regulations. The current civil penalty assessment process for these actions is outlined below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the investigation phase, FAA investigative personnel ordinarily notify alleged violators of an agency investigation
by issuing a letter of investigation. This notification is described in FAA Order 2150.3A, the FAA's Compliance and
Enforcement Program, but is not required by statute, regulation, or that order. Following an investigation, a civil
penalty may be assessed only after notice of the proposed charges and an opportunity for a hearing. This process is
begun by issuing a notice of proposed civil penalty to an alleged violator (respondent). Section 13.16(c) delegates
the authority to the FAA's Deputy Chief Counsel and certain Assistant Chief Counsel in the regions, centers, and headquarters
to issue such notices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents have several options to respond to the notice of proposed civil penalty. The person charged with a violation
is required to do one of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Submit the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed-upon lower amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Submit written information demonstrating that the violation did not occur, or that a penalty or the penalty amount
is not warranted under the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Submit a request for a reduction of the proposed civil penalty, including the amount of reduction along with supporting
reasons and documentation, such as records indicating a financial inability to pay the proposed penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Submit a written request for an informal conference to discuss the matter with an agency attorney and submit relevant
information or documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Request a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) of the Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of
Hearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a respondent does not respond to the notice of proposed civil penalty, or chooses to proceed informally in response
to a notice of proposed civil penalty, and the matter is not resolved, the FAA attorney then serves a final notice of
proposed civil penalty. The respondent must either request a hearing before an ALJ or pay the amount of the proposed
civil penalty, or an agreed-upon amount, within 15 days of receipt of the final notice. If neither a penalty is paid
nor a hearing is requested during the 15-day period, the FAA attorney serves an order assessing civil penalty, which
contains a finding of violation and assesses a civil penalty. That order is final and not appealable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 7, 1993, the Vice President's National Performance Review published a report entitled ``From Red Tape
to Results: Creating a Government that Works Better and Costs Less.'' That report included a recommendation that
the FAA streamline its civil penalty enforcement program by eliminating several of the procedural steps it takes
to issue civil penalties in certain minor, uncontested cases. The FAA has determined that streamlined procedures
would be most appropriately applied to those legal enforcement actions that facially appear to be simple and factually
straightforward. The SFAR adopts interim changes to the existing rules governing procedures and delegation of authority
that are designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the processing of civil penalty assessment actions
in these types of cases. The National Performance Review indicates that a streamlined enforcement process may reduce
costs, improve efficiency, and enhance safety by notifying individuals of certain violations and processing these
actions within reduced time frames.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to shortening the time for initiating certain cases, it is expected that this test program also will encourage
prompt settlement of proposed civil penalties in these cases. The program will not eliminate an individual's opportunity
to request a hearing or otherwise contest a proposed civil penalty. This SFAR will be effective for two years, unless
sooner canceled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulatory changes initially will be tested in certain civil penalty assessment actions resulting from violations
occurring in two FAA regions (Great Lakes and Southwest) at three airports (Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport,
O'Hare International Airport, and Indianapolis International Airport). The program may be extended to violations
at other airports or regions during the duration of the test program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the test program will apply only to alleged violations by individuals presenting dangerous or deadly
weapons for screening at airports or in checked baggage, for which a civil penalty less than $5,000 is proposed. While
the FAA considers these violations to be serious, the initial evaluation and processing of these cases tends to be
uncomplicated. Violations of weapons prohibitions, on the other hand, for which a penalty of $5,000 or more is sought
ordinarily are more factually complex and involve evidence of several aggravating factors. As a result, these cases
tend to be more difficult to process, and, therefore, would not be appropriate for handling under the test program.
The FAA does not intend to apply this program to complex civil penalty actions, including factually complicated cases
under $5,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the program is successful in streamlining the civil penalty enforcement process for the cases described above,
the FAA will consider amending this rule to extend the program to include other relatively simple violations warranting
civil penalty action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Procedures and Delegations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The test program will involve several changes to current enforcement practice. The test program dispenses with the
FAA's current practice of ordinarily issuing to the alleged violator a letter of investigation seeking information
about the alleged violation. Experience has indicated that in the majority of factually clear, uncomplicated cases,
the respondent often does not provide additional relevant information that is not already known to the FAA. The information
received by the FAA from local law enforcement offices regarding weapons violations at airport screening checkpoints
tends to be complete and beyond serious dispute. A respondent, however, will continue to have an opportunity to make
any statements and submit any evidence regarding the alleged violation following notification of the alleged violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA Office of Civil Aviation Security Division Managers and Deputy Division Managers, instead of FAA attorneys,
will initiate a legal enforcement action by issuing a notice of violation (NOV) to the respondent. The NOV will cite
the relevant facts and circumstances pertaining to the alleged infraction and will include a proposed civil penalty
amount. The authority to issue NOVs will not be delegated below the division level. By delegating to the Office of Civil
Aviation Security the authority to send the initial notification to a respondent of an alleged violation, the FAA
believes that it can reduce significantly the time currently expended before a respondent is given this notification.
The name and phone number of a security agent involved in the investigation will be included in the NOV in case the respondent
has any questions about the action being proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NOV will serve the same purpose that the notice of proposed civil penalty now serves under current procedures.
The NOV, however, will include the following specific information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A description of the alleged violation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed amount of civil penalty;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An offer of settlement of the case, if appropriate, as described below;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) The name and phone number of an FAA security special agent involved in the investigation of the violation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Information regarding informal procedures; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Information on how to request a formal hearing before a DOT ALJ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In appropriate cases, the agency may extend to the respondent a settlement offer to resolve the case immediately with
a reduction of the proposed civil penalty, on the condition that the penalty is paid or a commitment to pay is made within
30 days. In conjunction with the publication of this rule, the FAA will issue guidance on the exercise of its discretionary
settlement authority in these cases as well as other similar cases not covered by the test and evaluation program.
This guidance will be published in Appendix 1 of FAA Order 2150.3A, Compliance and Enforcement Program, and may be
changed during the test program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA believes that swifter notification of a violation, coupled, in most cases, with an immediate offer of settlement,
may encourage quick resolution of simple cases while, at the same time, having no negative impact on the effectiveness
of the enforcement process. The National Performance Review studied a similar program offered by the Federal Highway
Administration and found that approximately 40 percent of proposed civil penalties were paid in this manner within
30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of this SFAR will not limit the respondent's rights in any way. An individual may choose to proceed under
the current informal and formal procedures, including requesting an informal conference with an FAA attorney or
formal hearing before a DOT ALJ. If the FAA and respondent are unable to resolve the case informally, or if the respondent
fails to respond to the NOV within 30 days after receiving it, a final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment
order (``final notice and order'') will be issued to the respondent. This document serves two purposes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It provides a second opportunity for the respondent to request a hearing on the record before a DOT ALJ; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It becomes an order assessing a civil penalty if the respondent pays the civil penalty proposed in the final notice
and order, or the respondent does not request a hearing in accordance with the final notice and order and fails to pay
the amount of the proposed civil penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This streamlined process dispenses with the current procedure requiring a separate order assessing civil penalty
to be sent to the respondent when the respondent pays the amount of the civil penalty reflected in the final notice of
proposed civil penalty, or when the respondent fails to request a hearing in accordance with the final notice of proposed
civil penalty and fails to pay the amount of the proposed civil penalty. The final disposition of the assessment action
results from the respondent's act or failure to act upon receipt of the final notice. Issuance of a separate document
entitled ``order assessing civil penalty'' under the current procedures provides no additional rights or notice
to the respondent that is not otherwise given in the final notice and order under these procedures. Accordingly, elimination
of the issuance of a separate order assessing civil penalty under these circumstances will not alter the procedural
protections afforded respondents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final notice and order will be issued by an appropriate Assistant Chief Counsel. The final notice and order will
result in either a civil penalty assessment or a formal hearing.

Regulatory Evaluation Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes to Federal regulations are required to undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866
directs each Federal agency to propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effect of regulatory changes on international trade. With respect to this rule, the FAA has
determined that it: (1) is not ``a significant regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not significant
as defined in the Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) will not constitute a barrier to international trade. Therefore,
a full regulatory analysis, which includes the identification and evaluation of cost-reducing alternatives to
this rule, has not been prepared. Instead, the agency has prepared a more concise analysis of this rule which is presented
in the following paragraphs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule establishes a test program at three airports. The program covers certain civil penalty cases against individuals
submitting dangerous or deadly weapons for screening at airport checkpoints or in checked baggage. The rule will
apply only to those cases that facially appear to be simple and are factually straightforward, and that are uncomplicated
to process. During the test period, the rule delegates authority to program office managers to initiate legal enforcement
actions and reduces the number of documents issued in this action. The rule is intended to streamline the agency's
civil penalty enforcement process of notifying individuals of certain violations by processing these actions within
reduced time frames.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There will be no costs associated with this rule because it consists only of changes to agency rules of procedure or
practice in part 13 of the FAA's regulations. The changes do not impose any new economic requirements on the affected
parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The streamlined procedures will reduce the number of documents to be served upon individuals. Additionally, this
rule will likely reduce the time between the violation and the processing of the enforcement action.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by Federal regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if
a rule will have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order 2100.14A outlines
FAA's procedures and criteria for implementing the RFA. Small entities are defined as independently owned and operated
small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations. Because this rule will directly affect certain individuals
(who are not defined as entities), the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the rule only will affect certain individuals, it will not constitute a barrier to international trade, including
the export of American goods and services to foreign countries and the import of foreign goods and services to the United
States.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government
and that of any state, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
The respondents affected by the amendments are private citizens, not state governments. Therefore, in accordance
with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this regulation will not have federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory
action under Executive Order 12866. This rule is not considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). In addition, this rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

notice of violation contains a statement of the charges and the amount of the proposed civil penalty. Not later than
30 days after receipt of the notice of violation, the person charged with a violation shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Submit the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed-upon amount, in which case either an order assessing
a civil penalty or a compromise order shall be issued in that amount;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Submit to the regional Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel any of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Written information, including documents and witness statements, demonstrating that a violation of the regulations
did not occur or that a penalty or the penalty amount is not warranted by the circumstances;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A written request to reduce the proposed civil penalty, the amount of reduction, and the reasons and any documents
supporting a reduction of the proposed civil penalty, including records indicating a financial inability to pay
or records showing that payment of the proposed civil penalty would prevent the person from continuing in business;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A written request for an informal conference to discuss the matter with an agency attorney and submit relevant
information or documents; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Request a hearing in which case a complaint shall be filed with the hearing docket clerk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment order (``final notice and order'') may be issued after participation
in any informal proceedings as provided in paragraph (B)(2) of this section, or after failure of the respondent to
respond in a timely manner to a notice of violation. A final notice and order will be sent to the individual charged with
a violation. The final notice and order will contain a statement of the charges and the amount of the proposed civil
penalty and, as a result of information submitted to the agency attorney during any informal procedures, may modify
an allegation or a proposed civil penalty contained in the notice of violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final notice and order may be issued_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the person charged with a violation fails to respond to the notice of violation within 30 days after receipt of
that notice; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the parties participated in any informal procedures under paragraph (B)(2) of this section and the parties
have not agreed to compromise the action or the agency attorney has not agreed to withdraw the notice of violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Order assessing civil penalty. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An order assessing civil penalty may be issued after notice and opportunity for a hearing. A person charged with a violation
may be subject to an order assessing civil penalty in the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An order assessing civil penalty may be issued if a person charged with a violation submits, or agrees to submit,
the amount of civil penalty proposed in the notice of violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An order assessing civil penalty may be issued if a person charged with a violation submits, or agrees to submit,
an agreed-upon amount of civil penalty that is not reflected in either the notice of violation or the final notice and
order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The final notice and order becomes (and contains a statement so indicating) an order assessing a civil penalty
when the person charged with a violation submits the amount of the proposed civil penalty that is reflected in the final
notice and order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The final notice and order becomes (and contains a statement so indicating) an order assessing a civil penalty
16 days after receipt of the final notice and order, unless not later than 15 days after receipt of the final notice and
order, the person charged with a violation does one of the following_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Submits an agreed-upon amount of civil penalty that is not reflected in the final notice and order, in which case
an order assessing civil penalty or a compromise order shall be issued in that amount; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Requests a hearing in which case a complaint shall be filed with the hearing docket clerk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Unless an appeal is filed with the FAA decisionmaker in a timely manner, an initial decision or order of an administrative
law judge shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if an administrative law judge finds that an alleged
violation occurred and determines that a civil penalty, in an amount found to be appropriate by the administrative
law judge, is warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Unless a petition for review is filed with a U.S. Court of Appeals in a timely manner, a final decision and order of
the Administrator shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if the FAA decisionmaker finds that an alleged
violation occurred and a civil penalty is warranted.

 the Commission responds to petitions for reconsideration or clarification of the rules and policies adopted in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this proceeding, which sets forth general rules for the use of competitive bidding to award licenses for use of the
spectrum. The Commission makes minor changes in the rules adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This action is taken to implement Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The rules will promote
the development and rapid deployment of new technologies, products, and services for the benefit of the public, including
those residing in rural areas. These rules also will promote economic opportunity and competition, and disseminate
licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses
owned by members of minority groups and women. This action will result in recovery for the public of a portion of the
value of the public spectrum made available for commercial use.

Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 established rules for determining what types of services and licenses may be subject to auctions. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also set forth a range of auction designs and procedures, from which the Commission stated it would choose in establishing

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 addressed a variety of procedural issues regarding announcement of auctions, filing of applications, bidder and
licensee qualifications, payment requirements, and penalties for default or disqualification, as well as safeguards
to deter possible abuses of the bidding and licensing process. In response to statutory directive, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 also identified provisions designed to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses
owned by women or members of minority groups (designated entities) are given the opportunity to participate in the
provision of spectrum-based services.

4. In many cases, the appropriate auction procedures and rules vary from service to service. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we retained the flexibility to choose, from within a defined range, the appropriate procedures for particular services,
depending on characteristics of the service such as the likely value and interdependence of the licenses being auctioned
and the capital required to construct a system. We also retained the flexibility to alter our procedures in response
to our experience with different auction techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. We dispose of all but two of the petitions for reconsideration of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this Order. We defer consideration of Brown and Schwaninger's petition concerning Finder's Preferences. We plan
to issue a Further Notice addressing the applicability of Finder's Preferences to auctionable services in the near
future, and we will consider Brown and Schwaninger's petition in the context of that Notice. We also defer to a future
Order consideration of MCI's petition concerning auctioning of BETRS licenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration fall into three categories: those dealing with the applicability
of competitive bidding to specific services and particular circumstances, those dealing with auction design and
procedures, and those dealing with the definition of the groups eligible for special provisions (the ``designated
entities'') and the nature of these provisions. We consider issues raised by these petitions below.

 The geographic areas not covered after five years by the initial licensees are considered cellular ``unserved areas''
that are licensed separately. In 1991, we adopted random selection procedures to govern licensing of the cellular
unserved areas,

8. After receiving comment and considering the extensive record, the Commission indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that, unless specifically excluded, mutually exclusive applications for licenses in the Public Mobile Services,
including the Cellular Service, will be subject to competitive bidding if they were filed after July 26, 1993.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 We noted, however, that applications filed before July 26, 1993 present special issues due to the ``special rule''
of Section 6002(e) of the Budget Act.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 That rule does not require the Commission to award licenses or permits by competitive bidding if the license applications
were filed before July 26, 1993, even if the applications otherwise meet the criteria that would subject them to selection
by bidding.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 We therefore stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that we would determine in a separate order how to authorize Public Mobile systems if applications were filed before
July 26, 1993.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Subsequently, after thorough consideration of the record, we adopted a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
stating that in such situations we will award licenses for the unserved areas by random selection.

9. Petitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received three petitions for reconsideration of the provisions of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
related to authorization of the cellular unserved areas.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 John G. Andrikopoulos, et al. (Andrikopoulos) states that where applications for cellular unserved area licenses
were accepted for filing before July 26, 1993, the applications should not be subject to competitive bidding. Andrikopoulos
asserts that auctioning these licenses would be unreasonable, retroactive application of the Budget Act.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 The Houston, Dallas, Oxnard and Huntington Cellular Settlement Groups (Cellular Settlement Groups; Groups) assert
that the Commission should accept full-market settlements between mutually exclusive applicants for cellular
unserved area licenses.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 These Groups state that Congress intended the Commission to continue use of its existing policy favoring full-market
settlements, and express concern that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
appears to profit full-market settlements where licenses will be awarded through competitive bidding procedures.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, Thumb Cellular, a party to a full-market settlement agreement filed for a Detroit unserved area, asks the
Commission to process its settlement agreement immediately.

10. Discussion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issues raised by these petitioners are fully addressed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which was released shortly after these petitions were filed. We stated in that item that we will grant licenses for
cellular unserved areas by random selection from the pool of applicants that filed lottery applications prior to
July 26, 1993, and we will permit full-market settlements among lottery applicants to avoid mutual exclusivity.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 Applications for cellular unserved areas accepted for filing prior to July 26, 1993 will not be subject to competitive
bidding. Accordingly, the issues raised by these three petitioners are moot.

B. Principal Use of PCS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Section 309(j)(1) of the Communications Act, as amended, permits auctions only where mutually exclusive applications
for initial licenses or construction permits are accepted for filing by the Commission and where the principal use
of the spectrum will involve or is reasonably likely to involve the receipt by the licensee of compensation from subscribers
in return for enabling those subscribers to receive or transmit communications signals.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we concluded that PCS service would meet the criteria for auctionablility.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Millin requests that we reverse that decision and conduct further inquiry concerning the possibility of non-subscription
PCS.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 We consider and rejected Millin's arguments in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in this docket, stating that the overwhelming weight of the comments in that proceeding, as well as our experience
with the PCS experiments that we have licensed, reflect that licensed PCS spectrum is likely to be used principally
for the provision of service to subscribers for compensation.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 We continue to believe that the record strongly supports the likelihood that PCS spectrum will be used principally
for the provision of service to subscribers for compensation. Accordingly, we deny Millin's request.

III. Auction Design and Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Activity and Stopping Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Activity rules and stopping rules are intended to govern the speed and duration of bidding in an auction. An activity
rule encourages each bidder to participate actively through the course of an auction. Activity rules are intended
to ensure that simultaneous auctions with simultaneous stopping rules will close within a reasonable period of time
and that bid prices will convey meaningful information during the course of the auction. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission adopted a three-stage Milgrom-Wilson activity rule as the preferred activity rule when a simultaneous
stopping rule is employed.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 Under this rule the auction moves from stage I to stage II when, in each of three consecutive rounds of bidding, the high
bid has increased on less than some specified percent of the spectrum (measured in terms of MHz-pops) being auctioned.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 The auction will move from stage II to stage III when in each of three consecutive rounds the high bid has increased on
less than some specified percent of the spectrum (measured in terms of MHz-pops). The Commission, however, retained
the flexibility to decide whether to use an activity rule, and if so what type of activity rule to use. We described possible
activity rules, and stated the range of alternatives from which we would choose and the circumstances that might cause
us to choose particular rules. We stated that we would announce the activity rule to be used by Public Notice before
an auction.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 A stopping rule specifies when an auction is over. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we stated that, for simultaneous auctions, our preferred stopping rule was that all markets would close simultaneously
if a single round passed in which no new acceptable bids are submitted for any license. We retained the discretion,
however, to announce at any point during a multiple round auction would end after a specified number of rounds.

Petitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Southwestern Bell Corporation (SBC), the GTE Service Corporation (GTE), and the Association of Independent Designated
Entities (AIDE) argue that the three-stage Milgrom-Wilson activity rule is unnecessarily complex and should be
simplified or eliminated.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 SBC points out that the three-stage Milgrom-Wilson activity rule would require the Commission to track a large number
of upfront payments and eligibility levels, and notes that the software the Commission intends to develop to track
activity levels may not be developed in time. SBC states that allowing five automatic waivers, as the Commission proposes
to do, does not reduce the uncertainty and expense which the activity rule imposes and may make bidding strategy more
complex.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 GTE states that the upfront payment formula, when combined with the activity rule, unnecessarily restricts bidder
flexibility.
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 GTE states that the activity rules limit the ability of bidders to revise their plans in the course of the auction, particularly
if information revealed during the latter stages of the auction causes a bidder to become interested in additional
properties. The activity rules, according to GTE, discourage qualified entities from participating as fully as
they might otherwise do, so that some licenses may not be awarded to the entity placing the highest value on them.

SBC urges the Commission to alter the stopping rule to allow the agency to issue a notice that bidding will close after
a given number of rounds.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 GTE and SBC ask the Commission to adopt a simpler activity rule, such as a requirement that bidders be active on a single
license in each round.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 AIDE urges that the activity rules be withdrawn, at least in the case of designated entities.
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 Pacbell counters that the three-stage Milgrom-Wilson activity rule avoids delay, provides meaningful information,
and allows bidders the flexibility to react to that information, and that software is available to help ensure that
the Milgrom-Wilson rule will not be hard to implement.

For instance, GTE notes that a bidder may be interested in some properties only if it can also acquire other key properties.
GTE states that ``under the modified Milgrom-Wilson rule, the bidder could be forced to choose between dropping out
of the auction prematurely or staying active in markets that may prove to be less valuable if the bidder loses out in
the other key markets.'' GTE Petition at 9&hyph;10. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 considers the same situation of interdependency and concludes that a bidder would have more flexibility with the
three-stage Milgrom-Wilson rule than with another possible activity rule, that of starting the bidding with the
third stage of the Milgrom-Wilson rule.

15. We do not believe that the Milgrom-Wilson activity rules will excessively restrict bidders' flexibility to bid
for desired combinations of licenses or cause licenses to be awarded to bidders who value them less than other bidders.
The rules were expressly designed to counteract the incentive to delay serious bidding that occurs in simultaneous
auctions, without unduly limiting bidders' flexibility to pursue backup strategies and to use new information.
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 The restrictions placed on bidders at the beginning of the three-stage auction procedure are modest. In the first
stage, to retain full eligibility a bidder need only bid on, or have the highest bid from the previous round on, licenses
representing at least one-third of the MHz-pops he or she ultimately hopes to win. In the second stage, the bidder must
bid on, or hold the high bid on, two-thirds of the MHz-pops he or she hopes to win. Only in the third stage are bidders required
to bid on the full amount of MHz-pops they hope to acquire.
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 Bidders may shift bids among any combination of licenses from round to round.
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 Paul Milgrom points out that at the shift from stage I to stage II there will be no more than three bidders on an average
license, and at the shift to stage III there will be at most 11/2 bidders on an average license.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 Because the progression to higher stages imparts such information, it gives the bidders important signals concerning
the state of bidding. By stage III, bidding should be rapidly drawing to a close, and any major shifts in strategy should
already have been implemented. Bidders who believe that they may want to expand their purchases if prices are unexpectedly
low can guarantee their ability to do so by making a sufficiently high upfront payment.

Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we also stated our intention to reduce the complexity faced by bidders by developing bidding software and making it
available to all bidders in auctions in which a Milgrom-Wilson activity rule is used.
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 SBC expresses concern that the software may not be available in time. Software was in fact developed in time for the
July nationwide narrowband auction, and performed successfully in that auction. In light of that success, we have
no doubt that appropriate software will also be available for the remaining narrowband and broadband auctions.

17. Finally, we remind petitioners that, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we adopted the three-stage Milgrom-Wilson activity rules only as a preferred option.
<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>
 We deferred to later, service-specific Orders the choice of actual rules to be used in auctions for individual services,
depending, as discussed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on the characteristics of the services and our experience with the conduct of auctions. In addition, we retained the
flexibility to decide on an auction-by-auction basis, and to announce by Public Notice before the auction, whether
to use an activity rule, and if so what type of rule.
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, if experience shows that the Milgrom-Wilson rules are unduly difficult to administer, we may shift to other
activity rules, including the one recommended by petitioners requiring only that bidders be active on a single license
in each round. We also expressly retained the discretion, requested by SBC, to announce at any point during a multiple
round auction that the auction will end after some specified number of additional rounds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission also retained the ability to speed up an auction by announcing at any time during an auction that the
next stage of the auction will begin in the next bidding round.
<FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>
 In this Order the Commission wishes to make explicit that this discretion could be exercised by employing an alternative
rule for moving from one stage of the auction to the next. The Commission will announce by Public Notice prior to an auction
its intent to use an alternative rule. One possible alternative rule would be that the auction will move to the next
stage if in each of some fixed number of rounds, bidding activity is below some level measured as the ratio of new bids
(measured in terms of MHz-pops) to available licenses (measured in terms of MHz-pops). The ratio of new bids to licenses
may be a better measure of bidding activity than the percentage of total licenses on which the high bid has increased
(measured in terms of MHz-pops) because it accounts for the possibility that bidding may be concentrated on a few licenses.
In contrast, the latter measure indicates the same level of bidding activity regardless of how many bids are made on
a given set of licenses.

we stated that in multiple round auctions the Commission will generally specify minimum bid increments to speed the

<FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>
 The bid increment is the amount or percentage by which the bid must be raised above the previous round's high bid in order

20. In the recent nationwide narrowband auctions, it became apparent that the Commission may need further tools to
avoid unnecessarily long auctions. In order to expedite the auction process further, we also reserve the discretion
to establish a suggested opening bid on each license in addition to the minimum bid increment.
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 Where we adopt a suggested opening bid, initial bids will have to be above the minimum bid increment but may be below
the suggested opening bid. Generally, we will establish suggested opening bids in the range of $.02&hyph;$.20 per
pop per MHz for each license. This suggested opening bid will provide bidders with an incentive to start bidding at
a substantial portion of the license value, thus ensuring a rapid conclusion of the auction.

supra, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we chose our primary auction methodology, but noted that no one auction design is optimal for all auctionable services.
We stated that we would adopt auction rules for specific services in subsequent Report and Orders, based on criteria
established in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

procedures for those auctions in a Public Notice, but that those procedures also would be governed by criteria set

of bidding rounds, minimum bid amounts, and stopping rules, and we stated that we might make decisions regarding such
matters during the course of an auction.

Petition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Association of Business and Educational Radio, Inc. (``NABER'') asserts that the auction rules do not
comply with the public interest and the Administrative Procedure Act
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 because they allow the Commission to circumvent the normal notice and comment procedure, and that the rules prevent
providers of service from devising a business plan and auction strategy in advance.
<FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>
 NABER states that the Commission should eliminate its discretion to change the auction rules or procedures during
a particular auction, that bidders need to know the rules which will apply for a particular service auction, and that
interested parties should have the opportunity to provide meaningful comment before the final auction rules for
particular services and frequencies are set.
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 NABER asserts that should the Commission change bidding methods in mid-stream without prior public comment, the
Commission would violate the notice and comment rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, by
its failure to keep a record and analyze and consider all relevant matter regarding those new rules.

Discussion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that the process we have used to adopt auction designs and implementation procedures and the rules themselves
fully comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. In the NPRM in this docket, we provided notice of the auction designs
we were considering and requested comment on issues of auction design and procedure. We received voluminous public
comment on these issues. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we carefully considered all comments and suggestions concerning a wide variety of proposed auction designs, including
the comments and proposals of numerous experts in auction theory. We have established a broad framework for the conduct
of license auctions, specifying a menu of auction designs and procedures from which we will choose for individual
auctions. We have identified our preferred options, and have discussed the circumstances in which we believe the
various options will be most appropriate in order to serve our statutory goals, and which are therefore most likely
to be chosen. After the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
was issued, we made, in addition, more specific choices of auction designs for particular services in Orders dealing
with those services.
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 We have also established application, payment, and penalty procedures for individual services.
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 The procedures, we believe, afforded members of the public all of the procedural rights to which they are entitled
under the Administrative Procedure Act.

24. Our rules, however, must also be flexible enough so that we can adjust our procedures to fit the circumstances of
individual auctions. We will not know until we have gained some experience with simultaneous multiple round auctions
exactly what values of such parameters as bidding increments and triggers for movement to the next auction phase work
best under what circumstances. Consequently, we believe that it is important for those running the auctions to be
able to use information generated in the early auctions and in the early rounds of individual auctions. Further, it
may be important to be able to respond to the behavior of bidders in the course of particular auctions. We may find it
desirable to allow more time for consultation between bidding rounds in complex auctions, for instance, or, in light
of the statutory requirement to issue licenses expeditiously, to increase the bidding increment to hasten the conclusion
of an auction if the auction is proceeding slowly. Clearly, notice and comment procedures would be unworkable in such
cases. The flexibility that our rules permit us is analogous to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ad hoc 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decisional authority that may be exercised within other types licensing proceedings, and our discretion here is
similarly constrained by the general framework and standards embodied in our rules. The latitude remaining to the
Commission to alter auction procedures is, however, necessary to ensure that we can make improvements as we become
aware of the need for them, and that we can manage auctions efficiently. The Commission will exercise its discretion
in a manner consistent with our clearly articulated goals and the general procedures we have established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. We have also taken care to safeguard bidders' interests. During the course of an auction only minor adjustments
in procedures are permitted that will necessitate no major changes of strategy on their part. Further, we have stated
clearly which procedures are, and which are not, subject to change during the course of an auction, so that bidders
will know what kinds of changes to expect and to prepare for. We have stated that when we announce auctions for particular
services by public notice, we will also announce the procedures to be used in those auctions.
<FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>
 We believe that this approach will provide prospective bidders with ample information to plan rational bidding strategies.

26. Finally, although the Commission has never before used auctions as a licensing method, we note that our auction
procedures afford as much, or more, detailed guidance to bidders than is usually provided in advance of an auction.
For example, in conventional oral auctions the auctioneer customarily has the discretion to alter bid increments
and other procedures at will in any manner and at any time during an auction. As in other types of auctions, we believe
that it will be critically important to the success of our auctions to leave the Commission some discretion to fine-tune
auction procedures between auctions and, in some cases, on an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis, during the course of an auction. Accordingly, we affirm our original decisions to adopt rules that afford the
Commission some flexibility to modify its procedures during the course of an auction, within the scope of the options
we have delineated and under the circumstances described above.

27. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we required bidders to tender a substantial payment in advance of the auction in order to deter frivolous or insincere
bidding.
<FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>
 Upfront payments were also intended to provide a source of funds for collection of penalties for bid withdrawal.
<FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>
 The amount of the upfront payment was related to the level of eligibility the bidder wished to establish, measured
in terms of the population and amount of spectrum encompassed by the licenses on which the bidder was permitted to bid.
In some cases the upfront payment could amount to millions of dollars.
<FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>
 We required that upfront payments be submitted prior to bidding, and we did not permit use of letters of credit or Treasury
bills for upfront deposits due to administrative difficulties in accepting payment in such forms, at least until
the Commission has more experience in conducting auctions.
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 We stated that upfront payments made by a winning bidder would be applied to satisfy its down payment obligations,
and that losing bidders' upfront payments would be returned if they wished to withdraw from further bidding.

GTE asserts that the Commission should adopt an interest-bearing evergreen deposit procedure for upfront deposits.
<FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>
 GTE states that, since the Commission is not currently authorized to establish interest-bearing accounts, substantial
sums of money could be tied up in upfront deposits without any accrual of interest for substantial periods of time.
GTE asserts that maximum bidder flexibility can be achieved by allowing bidders to add or withdraw deposit funds during
the course of the auction. GTE states that the Commission needs to ensure that it has the requisite authority to permit
the accumulation and payment of interest.

29. AIDE states that when a winning bidder's upfront payments, less bid withdrawal penalties, exceed the required
deposit, the excess upfront payment should remain available for crediting to another auction or for refund to the
winning bidder.

 AIDE points out that, in the case of designated entities, the required deposit is only 10 percent. AIDE notes that the
Commission has stated that it will apply this policy for losing bidders, and as a matter of equal protection the Commission
should apply the same policy to winning bidders with excess upfront payments.

For example, an entity that is interested in bidding on several 30 MHz PCS licenses with a goal of providing service
to a population of at most 50 million should make an upfront payment of $30 million ($.02 x 30 MHz x 50,000,000). That
bidder will not be permitted to bid (at any time) in the auction, or be permitted to win, 30 MHz licenses covering more
than 50 million pops.

Discussion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Allowing bidders to add funds to upfront deposits in order to increase their eligibility level, or to withdraw funds
from upfront deposits, as GTE recommends, would add greatly to the complexity of the Commission's administrative
task. The Commission would have to keep track of changes in eligibility due to changes in upfront payments, as well
as to changes in bidders' activity levels, and would have to ascertain that fund transfers had taken place before permitting
bidders to bid at the levels to which the additional payments entitled them. Because of the short intervals between
rounds, delays in the transfer of funds would likely create problems for both bidders and the Commission. For these
reasons, we believe it is prudent to require bidders to submit upfront payments that represent the maximum level of
bidding that they anticipate before the beginning of the auction. Bidders can always ensure that they will be able
to expand their bidding above their originally anticipated level by submitting a sufficiently large upfront payment
and maintaining a high activity level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32. We agree with AIDE that winners' upfront deposits, in excess of their required down payment deposits and any penalties
they may owe, should be refunded expeditiously. We intend to refund excess upfront deposits of all bidders as soon
as possible. We will not apply excess upfront deposit balances to subsequent auctions, however, due to the additional
administrative difficulty of tracking the funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33. With respect to AIDE's request for clarification, we clarify that footnote 133 means that in any round of the auction,
a bidder who has made an upfront payment of $30 million may bid on, or hold the high bid from the previous round on, 30 MHz
licenses in markets with a combined population totaling not more than 50 million. The specific licenses on which the
bidder submits bids may vary from round to round, but the total MHz-pop ceiling cannot be exceeded in any single round.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission imposed a default penalty for withdrawing a bid after a simultaneous multiple round auction has closed.
<FOOTCITE>70</FOOTCITE>
 This default penalty was set at 3 percent of the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission,
or 3 percent of the amount of the defaulting bidder's bid, whichever is less. The default penalty would be imposed in
addition to the bid withdrawal penalty, which was set at the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the
subsequent winning bid. We stated that the default penalty was intended to provide an incentive for bidders who wished
to withdraw their bids to do so before the close of the auction. We stated that such a penalty was appropriate because
a withdrawal that occurs after an auction closes is likely to be more harmful than one that occurs before closing. We
stated that if a withdrawal occurs after the auction closes, other bidders will have little opportunity to revise
their strategies, and the likelihood will be lower that the licenses will be awarded to those who value them most. We
also stated that default imposes on the government the extra costs of re-auctioning the license.

Discussion.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe that it is appropriate to charge the full 3 percent default penalty in addition to the bid withdrawal penalty
whether or not the winning bid in the second auction exceeds the defaulting bid. As we stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the function of the default penalty is to encourage bidders who plan to withdraw their bids to do so before the close
of the auction.
<FOOTCITE>72</FOOTCITE>
 The additional costs to the Commission and to other bidders of auctioning the license a second time, and the increased
likelihood that the license will not be won by the bidder who values it most, are incurred as a consequence of default
regardless of the level of the bids. Even if the winning bid is higher than the defaulting bid, we have no reason to believe
that it is higher than the winning bid would have been had the defaulting bidder withdrawn before the close of the auction,
nor have we reason to believe that a high winning bid compensates for the undesirable effects of default. Consequently,
we retain the default penalty as set forth in the

 the Commission recognized the informational benefits to be gained from releasing bidder identities during an auction,
but concluded that such information should not be released because ``the risk of collusion and strategic manipulation
outweighs the benefits of the additional information.'' Instead the Commission adopted an intermediate approach
pursuant to which the bidder identification numbers and bid amounts for each bidder will be released at the end of each
round of bidding. This approach provides bidders with useful information without incurring excessive risks of collusion
and strategic manipulation.

 GTE and Southwestern Bell request that the identities of bidders be released during the course of the auction. GTE
requests that the identity of the bidder associated with each bidder identification number be disclosed during the
bidding process.
<FOOTCITE>74</FOOTCITE>
 SBC states that the Commission should announce both the identity of the highest bidder and the bid amount for each round
of the auction.
<FOOTCITE>75</FOOTCITE>
 GTE argues that a bidder must construct a strategy based on its own valuation of the spectrum as well as estimates of
its competitors' valuations and past bids, and that a fundamental component of this exercise is knowledge of who the
competitors are. GTE notes that the Commission's sole justification for not furnishing information about the identity
of bidders is a concern for collusion, and states that the

 includes other mechanisms for minimizing collusion. GTE states that increases in available information raise the
level of competition and the efficiency of license assignments, and that access to bidder identification information
may increase revenue from the auction process while ensuring award to the bidder who most highly values the license.
<FOOTCITE>76</FOOTCITE>
 SBC argues that the decision to keep winning bidder identities secret creates an opportunity for collusive behavior
because cartels could coordinate activities and punish violators without detection. SBC notes that if the identity
of all bidders is known, the Commission and bidders need not be concerned with protecting bidders' identity. SBC states
that knowing who the successful bidders are affects other bidders' ability to assess the accuracy of their valuation
of the spectrum and allows them to ascertain that an aggregation of licenses is underway which might pose a competitive
threat. MCI states that because of the potential for bidder collusion and strategic manipulation, bidder identities
should not be revealed.

Discussion.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Arguments in favor of disclosing bidder identities primarily turn on the value of the information in improving the
quality of bids. Some auction experts argue that bidders' estimates of license values can be improved by comparing
them to the valuations of their competitors.
<FOOTCITE>78</FOOTCITE>
 Bidders' valuations of licenses may also be highly dependent on knowing the identity of neighboring carriers, especially
regional leaders and competitors, and on knowing the manner in which complementary licenses are likely to be used
and the compatibility of standards both inside and outside their desired service areas. Maximizing information
available to bidders may increase bids by decreasing bidders' incentives to reduce their bids to avoid the ``winner's
curse,'' the tendency for the bidder who most overestimates the value of the item for sale to win an auction. Revealing
bidder identities may facilitate awarding licenses to those who value them most highly by providing more information
to bidders. More accurate valuation of licenses by bidders can thus improve the efficiency of license assignments.
In addition, publicly disclosing the identity of other bidders may encourage vigorous bidding for licenses. Releasing
bidder identities may increase interest in and media coverage of the auctions.

40. Our experience with the first narrowband PCS auction showed that preventing bidder identities from being revealed
can be extremely difficult. In addition, if some but not all bidders know other bidders' identities, those bidders
have an advantage in the quality of information available to them and in the potential ability to thwart others' bidding
strategies. Concealing bidder identities may give an advantage to larger bidders that have the resources to devote
to discovering other bidders' identities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41. As we noted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 however, releasing the identities of high bidders may foster strategic manipulation, such as bidding up the prices
of licenses needed by rivals, and may facilitate collusion.
<FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>
 Some auction experts argue that anonymity makes it harder to target a firm for strategic hold-up because the bidding
and aggregation strategies of specific competitors cannot be easily detected.
<FOOTCITE>80</FOOTCITE>
 Concealing bidder identities makes initiating collusive arrangements during the course of an auction more difficult
because bidders will not easily be able to identify the parties against whom they are bidding, unless those parties
voluntarily reveal their identities. On the other hand, concealing bidders' identities may not be critical to preventing
collusion during an auction; existing antitrust laws and the FCC's collusion rules should be adequate to prevent
collusive conduct. In any event, under an anonymous bidding scenario, if bidders want to collude they can simply disclose
their bidder identification numbers to one another before the auction.

42. Because of the advantages of providing more information to bidders and the difficulties involved in ensuring
that bidder identities remain confidential, we will generally release the identities of bidders before each auction.
However, we recognize that experts disagree on the potential for knowledge of bidders' identities to facilitate
collusion and other strategic behavior. Consequently we wish to have the flexibility to conceal bidder identities
if further experience shows that it would be feasible and desirable to do so. We may also wish to test the effects of releasing
identities of bidders. Consequently we are reserving the option to withhold bidder identities on an auction-by-auction
basis. If we decide to withhold bidder identities for a particular auction, we will announce that decision by a service-specific
auction Order. We will announce by Public Notice prior to each auction whether the identities of bidders will be made
public in that auction.

 GTE states that for 10 MHz blocks in broadband PCS the Commission should adopt the ``standby queue'' bidding mechanism
considered in experiments sponsored by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and conducted
at the California Institute of Technology.
<FOOTCITE>81</FOOTCITE>
 The standby queue allows parties seeking individual licenses to coordinate their bids in order to beat a bid for a combination
of licenses. GTE asserts that the standby queue would allow bidders seeking to combine smaller blocks into a larger
set of frequencies, or to combine blocks on a geographic basis, to obtain information about the status of bidding that
would permit them to bid rationally and efficiently.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we concluded that the disadvantages of combinatorial bidding were likely to outweigh the advantages for auctions
of broadband PCS licenses, and we adopted simultaneous multiple round bidding as our auction methodology for broadband
PCS licenses. Nevertheless, we left open the option to use combinatorial auctions if simultaneous multiple round
auctions do not result in efficient aggregation of licenses, and if there are significant advances in the development
of combinatorial auctions.
<FOOTCITE>82</FOOTCITE>
 Although we have no current plans to use combinatorial auctions, if in the future we do adopt such an auction methodology
we will consider the use of a standby queue mechanism.

 William E. Zimsky (Zimsky) states that the rule imposing filing fees for the filing of short-form applications for
auctions should be deleted.
<FOOTCITE>83</FOOTCITE>
 Zimsky asserts that because there is no provision in 47 U.S.C. &sect;158(g) for imposing the filing fee for the new
short-form application, the Commission lacks the statutory authority to impose such a fee. Zimsky also asserts that,
even if the Commission has such statutory power, to impose a filing fee on all bidders is unreasonable because the filing
fee was designed to recoup the costs of fully processing the application. Since only auction winners will submit long-form
applications and have their applications scrutinized, the losing bidders do not receive this service. Consequently,
the Commission's proposed scheme is unconstitutional, he argues, because a user fee which is not reasonably related
to, or a fair approximation of, the cost incurred by the government in providing the service for which the fee is assessed,
effects a taking of applicants' property without just compensation, in violation of their fifth amendment rights.

 The Commission has requested express statutory authority to impose section 8 application fees for short-form applications.
In the absence of such express authority, we do not currently impose fees for short-form applications. However, long-form
applications in most services are subject to fees under section 8. Consequently we find Zimsky's petition to be moot,
and we dismiss it.

BET Holidays, Inc. (BET) states that the above requirements prevent bidders from entering into any new agreements,
joint ventures or similar arrangements with other entities after filing a short-form application.

 BET claims that as a consequence bidders may be locked into bidding arrangements significantly before the commencement
of the auctions, and will be unable to modify their bidding strategies, consult with experts or others, or enter into
alliances with new parties any time after the filing of the short-form application. BET states that the collusion
rule is an unrealistic constraint on lawful business behavior. For example, according to BET, if a company does not
identify affiliates or others with whom it must consult, the company would be forbidden from soliciting research,
sharing resources, or discussing its bids until after the winning bidder tenders its down payment.

Discussion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While we intend to rely primarily on the antitrust laws to prevent bidding collusion, we believe that the anticollusion
rules in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
will provide an important tool that will enable the Commission to detect, prevent, and punish collusion. To prevent
and detect collusion, we believe that it is important to have clearly stated rules concerning the entities with whom
communication about bidding strategies is permissible. The requirement that an entity identify at the time of the
short-form application those affiliates, or others with whom it has agreements concerning bidding, and the prohibition
of communication concerning bidding with entities identified by other bidders, serve this purpose and are not particularly
burdensome. Similarly, prohibiting additional agreements and alliances concerning bidding between applicants
bidding for the same licenses, after applications have been filed and the identities of all applicants are known,
seems a prudent deterrent to collusion that should have only a minimal and temporary effect on bidders' flexibility.
We wish to make explicit our intention that the prohibition extend to post-application settlement agreements and
discussions concerning settlement agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
51. We do believe, however, that our prohibition on communication among bidders and formation of agreements among
bidders after applications have been filed may have been excessively broad in that it includes communications and
agreements with bidders who are not bidding against each other, and so may prevent useful agreements that have no effect
on the competitiveness of bidding. Consequently, we are modifying our collusion rules, which currently prohibit
bidders from communicating with another after short-form applications have been filed regarding the substance
of their bids or bidding strategies and which also prohibit bidders from entering into consortium arrangements or
joint bidding agreements of any kind after the deadline for short-form applications has passed. In order to permit
certain bidders to respond to higher than expected license prices by combining their resources during an auction,
we will now permit bidders who have not filed Form 175 applications for any of the same licenses to engage in discussions
and enter into bidding consortia or joint bidding arrangements during the course of an auction. We conclude that where
bidders have not applied for any of the same licenses there is little risk of anticompetitive conduct and therefore
we believe that it is appropriate to relax our collusion rules to permit bidders in this context to have great flexibility
to increase their competitiveness in the auction by combining their resources, provided that no change of control
of any applicant takes place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
52. In addition, we now believe that entering into consortium arrangements or adding equity partners during an auction
may have a useful effect in enabling bidders to acquire the capital necessary to bid successfully for licenses. We
have concluded that formation of consortia or changes in ownership after the filing of short-form applications will
not necessarily have anticompetitive effects, provided they do not involve parties that might have bid against each
other and do not result in a change in control of the applicant. Consequently, we wish to modify our rules regarding
amendments to short-form applications. As a result of our experience in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction, we
believe that it is necessary to allow applicants to amend their FCC Form 175 applications to make ownership changes
after the filing deadline has passed, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant. Permitting
such amendments will provide bidders with flexibility to seek additional capital after applications have been filed,
whole ensuring that the real party in interest does not change. Accordingly, we will modify Section 1.2105(c) to permit
applicants to amend their FCC Form 175 applications to reflect ownership changes that do not result in a change in control
of the applicant, provided the parties have not filed Form 175 applications for any of the same licenses. Such changes
shall not be regarded as major amendments to an application, provided they do not result in a transfer of control of
the license or the applicant and do not change control of the company.

55. SBC asks that the Commission minimize requirements for disclosure of information upon transfer of licenses.
<FOOTCITE>90</FOOTCITE>
 SBC states that the point of transfer disclosures is to ``prevent unjust enrichment as a result of the methods employed
to issue licenses and permits.''
<FOOTCITE>91</FOOTCITE>
 SBC assserts that rules designed to prevent unjust enrichment should be solely applicable, if at all, to designated
entities that receive special accommodations, since the risk of unjust enrichment is high only in auctions where
such special accommodations are provided. SBC asserts that the formation of reasonable and efficient alliances
would be discouraged by the mandate to expose the details of the alliance to competitors. SBC particularly objects
to the requirement that any management agreements or consulting contracts be filed. SBC seeks clarification that
the disclosure requirements will apply only to the licensees which either have not begun to offer service or have only
offered service for some minimal period of time.

 With respect to ownership disclosure in short-form applications, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we decided to require applicants to furnish only minimal information in short-form applications and bidder certifications
prior to auctions in order to reduce administrative burdens and minimize the potential for delay.
<FOOTCITE>92</FOOTCITE>
 Further ownership disclosure requirements, however, were adopted on a service specific basis in later Reports and
Orders.
<FOOTCITE>93</FOOTCITE>
 We believe that GTE's concerns are fully met by these requirements.

57. As for transfer disclosure requirements, Congress in the Budget Act required us to develop and test alternative
auction designs.
<FOOTCITE>94</FOOTCITE>
 We noted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that in addition to allowing detection of unjust enrichment, transfer disclosure requirements would provide data
necessary for evaluation on our auction designs.
<FOOTCITE>95</FOOTCITE>
 We noted that the reporting requirements would allow us to monitor our compliance with the Congressional directive
in Section 309(j)(3)(B) to ensure that ``new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American
people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants.
*
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*.''
<FOOTCITE>96</FOOTCITE>
 The information will be useful in meeting our statutory obligation to report to Congress on the outcome of the auctions.
<FOOTCITE>97</FOOTCITE>
 The information we acquire from transfer disclosures, including purchase price and other aspects of the sale contracts
and management agreements, will enable us to determine the ultimate distribution of licenses and the value of the
spectrum for particular uses, and will permit comparisons between licenses awarded with and without designated
entity provisions. Such analyses require collection of data from all licensees, not just from designated entities
or those who have not begun to offer service or have only offered service for a short period of time. As we stated in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we do not expect the transfer disclosure requirements to be burdensome to licensees because the documents to be submitted
will have been prepared for other purposes in any event. Moreover, parties may request confidential treatment of
competitively sensitive information pursuant to &sect;&sect;0.457 and 0.459 of our Rules.
<FOOTCITE>98</FOOTCITE>
 Consequently we will retain transfer disclosure requirements for all transfers of licenses obtained by competitive
bidding.

Petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AIDE asserts that the Commission acted improperly in proposing substantive PCS application-processing rules in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPRM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because, it argues, such rules are outside the scope of this rulemaking, which is limited to implementation of the
competitive bidding requirements of &sect;390(j) of the Communications Act.
<FOOTCITE>100</FOOTCITE>
 AIDE argues that the Commission's proposal of application-processing rules is legally insufficient to constitute
a valid notice of proposed rules, and that some of the rules cited have no immediate applicability to PCS service. AIDE
asserts that in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission failed to respond to the merits of the arguments concerning filing and processing rules in AIDE's comments
on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPRM.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AIDE concludes that the Commission needs to issue a supplemental

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The competitive bidding process is a means of assigning licenses, and rules and procedures for processing of license
application are an integral and necessary part of that process. The Commission adopted few filing or processing rules
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Those rules that the Commission did adopt pertaining to the filing and processing of applications and certifications
were clearly proposed in the NPRM.
<FOOTCITE>101</FOOTCITE>

of those Orders.

 AIDE states that applying competitive bidding and payment requirements in addition to existing financial qualification
requirements disadvantages designated entities, who have historically been constrained by difficulties in capital
formation and financing. AIDE recommends that short-form applications not require and certification of financial
qualification. If an application become mutually exclusive, according to AIDE, the applicant's payment of its winning
bid would demonstrate that it was financially qualified. If the application did not become mutually exclusive, then
the applicant should have a short period in which to file any required demonstration of financial qualifications
by amendment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe that, in order to prevent the delay in bringing service to the public that might be occasioned by bankruptcies
or by prolonged financial negotiations, it is important to require licensee to have the financial ability to construct
and operate a system in addition to being able to purchase the license. Consequently we will continue to require applicants
to certify on their short-form applications that they meet any existing financial qualification requirements of
the services in which licenses are auctioned. We will not, however, impose additional showings of financial qualification
as part of the auction process.

64. Several provisions of the Budget Act address participation by small businesses, rural telephone companies,
and businesses owned by women and minorities (referred to collectively as ``designated entities'') in the competitive
bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services. Specifically, Section 309(j)(4)(D) of the Act,
provides that, in prescribing competitive bidding regulations, the Commission shall, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and

In addition, section 309(j)(3)(B), provides that in establishing eligibility criteria and bidding methodologies
the Commission shall seek to promote the objectives of ``economic opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that
new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration
of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural
telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.'' To promote these objectives,
section 309(j)(4)(A) expressly states that the Commission is required ``to consider *&blank;*&blank;* alternative
payment schedules and methods of calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment payments, with or without
royalty payments, or other schedules or methods.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we adopted a broad menu of provisions that the Commission might employ to implement these statutory provisions. We
adopted general provisions and eligibility rules designed to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies,
and businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women were afforded the opportunity to participate in both
the competitive bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services. Specifically, we provide that
small businesses (including those owned by women and/or minorities and rural telephone companies) that are winning
bidders for certain blocks of spectrum could pay in installments over the term of their licenses. We also indicated
that rural telephone companies may be eligible for bidding credits for licenses obtained in their service areas if
they make an additional infrastructure build-our commitment beyond any existing performance requirements. We
indicated that bidding credits may be available to designated entities on certain frequency blocks. In addition,
we retained the option of establishing set-aside spectrum in certain services, in which eligibility to bid may be
limited to some or all designated entities. Finally, we stated that we would consider the use of tax certificates as

to encourage licensees to assign licenses to designated entities in post-auction transactions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we recognized that the provisions applicable to particular designated entities would vary depending on the nature
of each individual service. For example, we retained the discretion to modify our general designated entity provisions
for capital intensive services such as broadband PCS. In this regard, we stated that we would evaluate on a service-specific
basis the capital requirements and other characteristics of the service to determine the appropriate provisions.
We continue to believe that it is essential for the Commission to retain flexibility to select, and if necessary to
modify, the general designated entity provisions and eligibility requirements on a service-specific basis depending
on the capital requirements and construction costs of the particular service.

 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we adopted a definition of ``rural telephone company'' that includes independently owned and operated local exchange
carriers that (1) do not serve communities with more than 10,000 inhabitants in the licensed area, and (2) do not have
more than 50,000 access lines, including all affiliates.
<FOOTCITE>108</FOOTCITE>
 We stated our belief that a limitation on the size of eligible rural telephone companies was appropriate because Congress
did not intend for us to provide special treatment to large LECs that happen to serve small rural communities.

69. In addition, Blooston, Mordkofsky, Jackson &amp; Dickens (Blooston) and South Dakota Networks, Inc. (SDN) request
that the Commission eliminate the term ``independently owned and operated'' from the definition of ``rural telephone
company.'' According to Blooston, this restriction is unnecessary to prevent the largest telephone companies from
taking advantage of provisions provided for rural telephone companies, since this same purpose is already served
by the 50,000 access line limit, Blooston argues the Commission should amend its eligibility rules to indicate that
they include the access lines of affiliates. Similarly, SDN indicates that the Commission should include ``and affiliates''
after ``50,000 or fewer access lines'' in the current definition. SDN maintains that the current language penalizes
holding companies structured to permit telephone companies to offer paging and other nonregulated services.

70. The National Telephone Cooperative Association (NTCA) requests that the Commission amend the definition of
rural telephone company to include any local exchange carrier with annual revenues of less than $100 million or serving
no more than 100,000 access lines. NTCA also indicates that the term ``independently owned'' should not exclude small
rural telephone companies that are affiliated with each other and that rural telephone company consortia should
be permitted. USIN similarly advocates a ``rural telephone company'' definition based annual revenues of less than
$100,000,000 or less than 100,000 access lines. According to USIN a revenue-based test is more accurate than net worth/net
profit test.

71. The Rural Cellular Association (RCA), South Dakota Network, Inc. (SDN) and NTCA ask that the Commission amend
the definition of rural telephone companies to include any independently owned and operated local exchange carriers
(``LECs'') that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
either
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 operate 50,000 access lines or less 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 serve communities of 10,000 or fewer inhabitants. According to NTCA and RCA, the existing definition needlessly
excludes many small independent telephone companies that serve rural areas. SDN alternatively requests that we
revise the definition to include carriers with 100,000 or fewer access lines or up to $100 million in annual revenues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
72. Finally, Anchorage Telephone Utility (ATU) requests that the Commission modify the definition of rural telephone
companies to include government-owned telephone companies. According to ATU, such a modification is necessary
to achieve congressional intent. ATU notes that the Senate bill included municipally-owned telephone companies
in its definition of rural telephone companies. ATU's argues that the Senate Bill mandates special consideration
for rural telephone companies and directed the FCC to grant ``rural program licenses'' to ``qualified'' common carriers
and explicitly said that the category of ``qualified'' carriers included all state-owned and municipally-owned
telephone companies.
<FOOTCITE>113</FOOTCITE>
 As evidence Congress' intent to include these provisions in the enacted version of Budget Act, ATU asserts that the
Conference Report declares that the Senate's ``findings'' are incorporated by reference.

 In its Comment on Petitions for Reconsideration, BET supports retention of the Commission's existing generic rural
telephone company definition.
<FOOTCITE>114</FOOTCITE>
 BET maintains that adoption of RCA's proposal to define rural telephone companies as LECs that have 50,000 access
or fewer or serve communities with no more than 10,000 inhabitants will allow large LECs that ``happen to serve rural
areas'' to qualify for designated entity provisions. In response to BET's Comments, RCA asserts that the ``independently
owned and operated'' requirement for rural telephone company eligibility will prevent large LECs from qualifying
for rural telephone company provisions. RCA also restates its request for an amendment to the general rural telephone
company definition to include LECs that serve 100,000 access lines or fewer.

Discussion.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are persuaded by petitioner's arguments that the current generic ``rural telephone company'' definition is overly
restrictive and effectively excludes many independently owned telephone companies that serve rural areas.
<FOOTCITE>118</FOOTCITE>
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we departed from our generic definition of rural telephone companies in the context of broadband PCS by adopting a
definition that includes any local exchange carrier having 100,000 or fewer access lines, including all affiliates.
<FOOTCITE>119</FOOTCITE>
 In adopting this definition of a ``rural telephone company,'' we sought to achieve the congressional goal of promoting
the rapid deployment of service in rural areas by targeting only those telephone companies whose service territories
are predominantly rural in nature, and who are thus likely to use their wireline telephone networks to build infrastructures
to serve rural America.
<FOOTCITE>120</FOOTCITE>
 For purposes of our rules governing broadband PCS licenses, we indicated our belief that this goal could best be achieved
if we defined ``rural telephone companies'' as those local exchange carriers having 100,000 or fewer access lines,
including all affiliates. We concluded that this definition included virtually all telephone companies whose service
areas are predominantly rural.

76. For the foregoing reasons, we also believe that using the 100,000 access line definition as our standard rural
telephone company definition will better serve our goals of encouraging the provision of service to rural areas than
the definition previously adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Accordingly, we will amend our standard definition of ``rural telephone company'' to include all local exchange
carriers with 100,000 access lines or fewer, including affiliates. In general, we believe that this definition will
more precisely capture those carriers that are truly rural in nature, while excluding the largest telephone carriers
that do not face similar capital formation problems. We believe that this definition will also better achieve Congress'
goal for fostering the development and rapid deployment of new technologies and services to rural areas by making
special measures available to legitimate rural telephone companies that require such provisions in order to meaningfully
participate in the provision of service to rural areas without giving such benefits to large companies that do not
require such assistance. Rural telephone companies that satisfy this definition thus will be eligible for rural
telephone company provisions in each service where such provisions are established.

77. As indicated above, Blooston, SDN and NTCA request that we eliminate the phrase ``independently owned and operated''
from the definition of ``rural telephone company.'' These petitioners assert that the ``independently owned and
operated'' restriction in the rural telephone company definition was intended to prevent large telephone companies
from taking advantage of rural telephone company benefits, but that this purpose is served by the access line limit.
In this regard, SDN argues that such language unduly penalizes holding companies of nonregulated services and entities
created by groups of telephone companies to provide equal access, SS7, and other services.

78. We agree. The new 100,000 access line rural telephone company definition adopted above includes the access lines
of affiliates. Under the affiliation rules established in the context of broadband PCS, and adopted below as our generic
affiliation rules, the access lines of holding companies, parent companies or affiliates of rural telephone companies
that are not independently owned will be attributed for purposes of determining eligibility. This definition will
capture most of the independently owned rural telephone companies, while excluding carriers affiliated with the
largest LECs. In addition, we are concerned that the requirement that a rural telephone company must be independently
owned would unnecessarily exclude rural telephone companies that are part of a holding company structure. Therefore
we will delete the ``independently owned and operated'' requirement from our standard rural telephone company definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79. With respect to ATU's request that we amend our definition of rural telephone company to include municipal and
government owned telephone companies that are owned by governmental authorities, we do not believe that such a change
is warranted. ATU contends that Congress meant to mandate special consideration not only for telephone carriers
serving rural areas but also for all municipally-owned telephone companies, even those with wholly or predominantly
urban service areas.
<FOOTCITE>122</FOOTCITE>
 This argument is based on ATU's interpretation of the Senate bill which preceded the enacted Budget Act. ATU argues
that the Senate bill containing the prototype of a mandate for special consideration for rural telephone companies
directed the FCC to grant ``rural program licenses'' to ``qualified'' common carriers and explicitly said that the
category of ``qualified'' carriers included all state-owned and municipally-owned telephone companies. ATU further
states that the report of the conference committee that drafted the Budget Act declares that the Senate's ``findings''
are incorporated by reference.
<FOOTCITE>123</FOOTCITE>
 ATU also asserts that without the aid of special assistance it and most other state-owned and municipal telephone
companies will not be able to purchase spectrum licenses at auction because it is politically infeasible for them
to generate and retain enough surplus revenue to fund such investments, due to popular aversion to increases in taxes
or telephone rates.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we are not persuaded by ATU's arguments.
<FOOTCITE>125</FOOTCITE>
 We can find no specific evidence that Congress intended the term ``rural telephone companies'' to include all state
or municipally-owned telephone companies. In fact, the preceding bill contained an explicit mandate for preferential
treatment of government-owned telephone companies that was deleted from the enacted bill. To the contrary, the fact
that an antecedent bill contained an explicit mandate for preferential treatment of government-owned telephone
companies that was deleted from the enacted bill could just as easily be interpreted as an indication that Congress
rejected such a rule. We also disagree that state and municipal governments are without the means to participate successfully
in auctions. As we noted in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

. Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (TDS) requests that the Commission relax the eligibility requirements for rural
telephone company bidding consortia by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) eliminating the 50,000 access line limit for rural telephone company consortium applicants; (2) allowing companies
with more than 50,000 access lines, directly or through affiliates, to participate in rural telephone company consortia
by demonstrating that more than 50 percent of their access lines company-wide (including affiliates) and over 50
percent of those in the proposed service area serve only communities with 10,000 or fewer inhabitants and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) providing that all rural telephone companies in consortia with 50,000 access lines or less have the right to hold
up to 60 percent of the equity in the consortium. SDN and NTCA also argue that the Commission should allow rural telephone
companies to form consortia, since combining telephone companies would not alter their rural nature, so long as the
rural telephone company retains at least 50.1 percent equity and control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
82. USIN similarly requests that small businesses, including rural telephone companies, be allowed to qualify for
special provisions if they pool their resources into consortia, provided such consortia are controlled by designated
entities. According to USIN, if such consortia are not permitted, rural telephone companies and other small businesses
may be foreclosed from participation in the auction process and in the provision of auctionable services. USIN also
indicates that efficiencies and economies of scale are created by aggregation and thus special measures should be
provided to these entities who may be able to provide service most efficiently.

We deny the requests of TDS, SDN,

for rural telephone company consortia. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as a general matter, we declined to provide exceptions to our designated entity eligibility criteria for applicants
that are consortia of various individual entities, which in combination fail to qualify as designated entities.
<FOOTCITE>128</FOOTCITE>
 We found that such combinations, if they deviate from our standard definitions of designated entities, should not
be eligible for provisions expressly designed for designated entities. This conclusion was based on our desire to
provide economic opportunity to those entities designated in the statute and to ensure such entities the opportunity
to provide spectrum-based services. We concluded that establishing exceptions to our definitions for consortia
(even those wholly comprised of otherwise qualified designated entities) would undermine this objective by diluting
the economic opportunity for individual qualified designated entities. We also found that allowing applicants
to be formed from a combination of eligible and ineligible entities would invite attempts to abuse the designated
entity provisions by those not entitled to them.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we noted that we may determine on a service-specific basis to allow a designated entity consortium to receive other
benefits based on equity and operational participation in the consortium by one or more designated entities. We retained
the flexibility to enable designated entity consortia to qualify for special provisions particularly where the
capital costs of a particular service are high and the formation of consortia is thus essential to foster investment
in designated entity ventures and to enable such entities to compete in the provision of such service. In this regard,
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we allowed consortia comprised of small businesses to qualify for all of the measures applicable to individual small
businesses provided each member of the consortium individually satisfies the definition of a small business. We
found that given the ``exceptionally large capital requirements'' associated with broadband PCS, allowing small
businesses to pool their resources in this manner was necessary to help them overcome capital formation problems
and thereby ensure their opportunity to participate in auctions and to become strong broadband PCS competitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

however, to provide that consortia may be permitted to qualify for any designated entity provisions (where each member
individually meets the eligibility requirements) on a service-specific basis, where the capital requirements
of the service are high. Where, as in broadband PCS, we will find that the capital requirements necessitate allowing
designated entities to pool their resources to help them overcome capital formation problems and thereby ensure
their opportunity to participate in auctions and in the provision of service, we may adopt rules allowing such consortia
to qualify for designated entity provisions.

Blooston and NTCA request that the Commission clarify the meaning of ``affiliate'' for purposes of access line aggregation.
According to Blooston, passive investments by a rural telephone holding company in other telephone companies should
not preclude eligibility for rural telephone company status, so long as there is no common control between the rural
telephone company and the other carrier. Blooston reasons that the common control definition is used in the auction
rules for small businesses' affiliates, has been used by the Commission when defining connecting carriers, and is
generally used by the financial community and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, Blooston requests
that the Commission amend its designated entity provisions to allow rural telephone companies to combine into consortia
and partner with investors without losing designated entity status so long as the majority equity control resides
with members who are rural telephone companies. NTCA similarly requests that the term ``affiliates'' be clarified
to indicate what organizational structures are permitted.

 Blooston specifically requests that we clarify the meaning of ``affiliate'' so that passive investments by a rural
telephone company in other rural telephone companies do not preclude designated entity status if there is no common
control. As described more fully below, under our affiliation rules a passive interest in another telephone company,
which does not constitute control of that company would not be considered an affiliation for purposes of access line
aggregation.

Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we expanded on the SBA's affiliation rules in establishing detailed affiliation standards for broadband PCS to be
used in the context of determining designated entity eligibility where our criteria are based on the size of the entity
seeking special treatment and require applicants to include ``affiliates'' when calculating their eligibility.
These affiliation requirements are intended to prevent entities that do not meet these size standards for receiving
benefits targeted to smaller entities.
<FOOTCITE>130</FOOTCITE>
 We believe that these rules are appropriate for determining affiliations generally, and therefore we will incorporate
these standards into our generic auction rules for purposes of determining all size-based eligibility requirements.

89. Where we adopt sized-based eligibility rules and provide that such eligibility determinations shall include
the applicant and all its ``affiliates,'' the following rules shall govern determinations regarding affiliation.
Apart from determining affiliation between the applicant itself and outside entities, the need to determine affiliation
arises where an investor has an attributable interest in a designated entity.
<FOOTCITE>131</FOOTCITE>
 In this context it is necessary for the Commission to examine whether such investor has a relationship with other persons
or outside entities that rise to the level of an affiliation with the applicant, and if so, whether the affiliate's
assets, revenues, net worth, number of access lines, or other applicable financial thresholds, when aggregated
with the applicant's, exceed the Commission's size eligibility thresholds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General Principles of Affiliation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An affiliation under the SBA rules would arise, first, from ``control'' of an entity or the ``power to control it.''
Thus, under the SBA rules, entities are affiliates of each other when either directly or indirectly (i) one concern
controls or has the power to control the other, or (ii) a third party or parties controls or has the power to control both.
<FOOTCITE>132</FOOTCITE>
 In determining control, the SBA's rules provide generally that every business concern is considered to have one or
more parties who directly or indirectly control or have the power to control it. The rules, in addition, provide specific
examples of where control resides under various scenarios, such as through stock ownership or occupancy of director,
officer or management positions. The rules also articulate general principles of control, and note, for example,
that control may be affirmative or negative and that it is immaterial whether control is exercised so long as the power
to control exists.
<FOOTCITE>133</FOOTCITE>
 Second, an affiliation, under SBA rules, may also arise out of an ``identity of interest'' between or among parties.
<FOOTCITE>134</FOOTCITE>
 We adopted these same general provisions as our affiliation rules for broadband PCS and will also incorporate them
into our general affiliation rules.

91. In adopting these affiliation rules, we emphasize that these rules will not be applied in a manner that defeats
the objectives of our service specific attribution rules. For example, in the context of broadband PCS, our attribution
rules expressly permit applicants to disregard the gross revenues, total assets and net worth of certain passive
investors, provided that an eligible control group has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control of the applicant.
<FOOTCITE>135</FOOTCITE>
 Our attribution rules are designed to preserve control of the applicant by eligible entities, yet allow investment
in the applicant by entities that do not meet the size restrictions in our rules. Therefore, so long as the requirements
of our attribution rules are met, the affiliation rules will not be used to defeat the underlying policy objectives
of allowing such passive investors. More specifically, if a control group has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control of the applicant, we shall not construe the affiliation rules in a manner that causes the interests of passive
investors to be attributed to the applicant.

92. Applying these SBA affiliation rules, an affiliation would arise, for example, where an entity with an attributable
interest in an applicant is under the control of another entity. An affiliation would also arise where an entity with
an attributable interest in an applicant controls, or has the power to control, another entity. For example, if an
attributable investor in an applicant is also a shareholder in a large Corporation X, when should Corporation X be
deemed an affiliate of the applicant as a result of the shareholder's ownership interest in both entities? Under the
SBA rules and the rules we adopt here, Corporation X would be deemed an affiliate of the applicant if the shareholder
controlled or had the power to control Corporation X, in which case, Corporation X's gross revenues must be included
in determining the applicant's gross revenues.

93. For purposes of determining control, ownership interests will be calculated on a fully-diluted basis. Thus,
for example, stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle)
will generally be considered to have a present effect on the power to control or own an interest in either an outside
entity or the PCS applicant or licensee. We will treat such options, debentures, and agreements generally as though
the rights held thereunder had been exercised.
<FOOTCITE>137</FOOTCITE>
 However, an affiliate cannot use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its control over or relationship
with another concern before it actually does so.

1. If company ``A'' holds an option to purchase a controlling interest in company ``B,'' the situation is treated as
though company ``A'' had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling interest in company ``B.'' The
[annual revenues] of both concerns must be taken into account in determining size. Example 2. If company ``A'' has
entered into an agreement to merge with company ``B'' in the future, the situation is treated as though the merger has
taken place. [A and B are affiliates of each other].

SBA's rules provide this example: If large company ``A'' holds 70 percent (70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting
stock of company ``B'' and gives a third party an option to purchase 66 of the 70 shares owned by A, company ``B'' will
be deemed to be an affiliate of company ``A'' until the third party actually exercises its option to purchase such shares.
In order to prevent large company ``A'' from circumventing the intent of the regulation which [gives] present effect
to stock options, the option is not considered to have present effect in this case.

Voting and Other Trusts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a similar vein, we also borrow from the SBA's rules and our own rules in other services to find affiliation under certain
voting trusts in order to prevent a circumvention of eligibility rules. The SBA's rules provide that a voting trust,
or similar agreement, cannot be used to separate voting power from beneficial ownership of voting stock for the purpose
of shifting control of or the power to control an outside concern, if the primary purpose of the trust is to meet size
eligibility rules.
<FOOTCITE>139</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, under the Commission's broadcast multiple ownership rules, stock interests held in trust may be attributed
to any person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, has the sole power to sell such stock, has the right to revoke
the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will.
<FOOTCITE>140</FOOTCITE>
 Also, under the broadcast rules, if a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the
grantor or the beneficiary of a trust, the stock interests held in trust will be considered assets of the grantor or
beneficiary, as appropriate.
<FOOTCITE>141</FOOTCITE>
 Because we believe the broadcast rules provide more definitive guidance in this particular area, we shall use them
as a model for the general affiliation rules adopted here. Thus, for example, if an investor with an attributable interest
in an applicant holds a beneficial interest in stock of another firm that amounts to a controlling interest in that
other firm, depending on the identity of the trustee, the other firm may be considered an affiliate and its assets and
gross revenues may be attributed to the applicant.

95. Officers, Directors and Key Employees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the SBA's affiliation rules, which we adopt as our generic approach, affiliations also generally arise where
persons serve as the officers, directors or key employees of another concern and they represent a majority or controlling
element of that other concern's board of directors and/or management of the outside entity.
<FOOTCITE>142</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, if a person with an attributable interest in an applicant, through his or her other key employment positions
or positions on the board of another firm, controls that other firm, then the other firm will be considered an affiliate
of the applicant. Such affiliations may or may not result in the applicant's exceeding our size limitations. As this
rule reflects, for purposes of attributing the financial position of an outside entity in this context, officers
and directors of an outside concern are not foreclosed entirely from holding attributable or non-attributable interests
in an applicant. Whether or not such persons control the outside entity, we also do not want to prohibit these persons,
who may be experienced in the telecommunications, finance, or communications and equipment industries, from assisting
start-up companies by serving as officers or directors of the applicant. Thus, if such persons serving as officers
or directors of the applicant do not control the applicant or otherwise have an attributable interest in the applicant,
their outside affiliations (even if controlling) will not be considered at all for purposes of determining the applicant's
eligibility under our rules.

SBA's size standard affiliation rules also provide that affiliations can arise in a variety of other scenarios, such
as where one concern is dependent upon another for contracts and business, where firms share joint facilities, or
have joint venture or franchise license agreements. To the extent we believe these rules may have general applicability
we shall codify them in our affiliate rules. We caution parties that issues relating to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
control of the applicant (or parties with attributable interests in the applicant) could also arise under arrangements
not expressly codified in the rules.

Affiliation Through Identity of Interest: Family and Spousal Relationships. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the SBA's rules, an affiliation may arise not only through control, but out of an ``identity of interest''
between or among parties.
<FOOTCITE>144</FOOTCITE>
 For example, affiliation can arise between or among members of the same family or persons with common investments
in more than one concern. In determining who controls or has the power to control an entity , persons with an identity
of interest may be treated as though they were one person.
<FOOTCITE>145</FOOTCITE>
 For example, if two shareholders in Corporation X are both attributable shareholders in an applicant, to the extent
that together they have the power to control Corporation X, Corporation X may be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.

97. Similarly, as under the SBA rules, we will consider spousal and other family relationships in determining whether
an affiliation exists. Under the SBA rules for determining small business status, for example, members of the same
family may be treated as though they were one person because they have an ``identity of interest.''
<FOOTCITE>146</FOOTCITE>
 Likewise, in order to determine whether individuals are economically disadvantaged, the SBA rules governing eligibility
for participation in the government's ``section 8(a)'' program for socially and economically disadvantaged small
businesses have special provisions for attributing spousal interests. The latter rules provide generally that
half of the joint-owned interests of an applicant and his or her spouse must be attributed to the applicant for purposes
of determining the applicant's net worth.

98. In the context of auction size-based eligibility standards at issue here, we begin by clarifying that our reason
for considering spousal and kinship relationships is not to determine whether the spouse or other kin of a women-owned
applicant actually is controlling the applicant, thereby violating our eligibility rules for woman-owned businesses.
Our rules do not embody any presumptions concerning spousal control in that context. Rather, our objective here is
to ensure both that entities are actually in need of the assistance provided by our rules and that entities otherwise
ineligible under applicable size criteria do not circumvent the rules by funding family members that purport to be
eligible applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
99. In formulating these rules, we need to consider also that, as a practical matter, it will not be possible for us prior
to the auctions to resolve all questions that pertain to the individual circumstances of particular applicants.
Furthermore, if we determine subsequent to an auction that a winning bidder in fact was ineligible to bid or to benefit
from special provisions, such as bidding credits, because of spousal or kinship relationships, not only will authorization
of service be delayed but, as discussed above, disqualified applicants may be subject to substantial penalties.
In these circumstances, we think that the public interest requires that we endeavor, insofar as possible, to establish
bright-line tests for determining when the financial interests of spouses and other kin should be attributed to the
applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100. We have decided that, for purposes of determining whether the financial limitations in our eligibility rules
have been met, interests of an applicant's spouse to the applicant. This will resolve any concern that an applicant
might transfer his or her assets to a spouse in order to satisfy the financial restrictions that apply to eligible entities.
For example, an applicant could not transfer stock or other assets to his or her spouse and thereby dispose of interests
that, I held by the applicant, would render the applicant ineligible. Just as importantly, this approach will resolve
any concern that an applicant might participate in bidding by using the personal assets of an ineligible spouse, which
would defeat entirely the objective of providing special financial measures for designated entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
101. In adopting this rule, we fully recognize that instances could arise in which, if all factors were considered,
attributing a spouse's financial interests to the applicant could lead to harsh results. As a general matter, however,
we think it provides a workable bright-line standard that resolves fully our policy concerns and avoids undesirable
ambiguity concerning the nature of our requirements. As in the SBA rules, however, one exception is clearly warranted;
this affiliation standard would not apply if the applicant and his or her spouse are subject to a legal separation recognized
by a court of competent jurisdiction. In calculating their personal net worth, for example, investors in the applicant
who are legally separated must, of course, still include their share of interests in community property held with
a spouse.

102. As indicated above, circumstances could also arise in which other kinship relationships are used as a means to
evade our eligibility requirements. Because we believe kinship relationships in many cases do not present the same
potential for abuse that exists with spousal relationships, particularly in terms of the ``identity of interests''
that are likely to exist between the persons involved, we shall adopt a more relaxed standard for determining when
kinship interests must be attributed to applicants. In this area, we shall follow the same standard that is applied
by the SBA when interpreting its ``identity of interest'' rule described above. Specifically, an identity of interests
between family members and applicants will be presumed to exist, but the presumption can be rebutted by showing that
the family members are estranged, or that their family ties are remote, or that the family members are not closely related
in business matters.
<FOOTCITE>148</FOOTCITE>
 For purposes of determining who is a family member under this rule, we shall use a definition that is identical to the
definition of ``immediate family member'' in the SBA's rules, 13 CFR 124.100.

103. In appropriate cases, an applicant should be able to rebut the presumption regarding kinship affiliations with
relative ease, simply by demonstrating that the applicant has no close relationship in business matters with the
relevant family members. Of course, should such business relationships arise with a winning applicant after the
auction, we might need to consider whether the applicant intended to circumvent the requirements of our eligibility
rules.

104. The affiliation requirement is intended to prevent entities that, for all practical purposes, do not meet the
size standard required for eligibility from receiving benefits targeted to smaller entities.

NCTA, USIN and SDN argue that the FCC should retain the rural telephone company bidding credit provision adopted in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
but delete the accelerated build-out requirement as a condition for receipt of bidding credits. USIN asserts that
bidding credits will not help attract capital when tied to such an expanded build-out requirement. According to USIN,
making bidding credits contingent on an accelerated build-out effectively nullifies the provision because the
commitment of additional capital for network build-out will reduce the amount available to finance the license price
by enough to offset any benefit conferred by the availability of the credit.
<FOOTCITE>150</FOOTCITE>
 SDN agrees that additional build-out should not be required as a prerequisite for rural telephone company bidding
credits, but states that a rural telephone company should receive additional bidding credits if it substantially
covers its certified rural service area during its license term.
<FOOTCITE>151</FOOTCITE>
 NTCA argues that the accelerated build-out requirement for bidding credits should be eliminated since this requirement
is unrelated to the statutory purpose of promoting investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services
in rural areas.

106. SDN also contends that the risk of forfeiting the bidding credit (plus interest) for failure to meet the expanded
build-out commitment will have a chilling effect because of the difficulty of anticipating potential problems that
may be encountered in attempting to extend service rapidly to remote areas. Further, SDN maintains that an accelerated
build-out requirement could engender a perverse incentive for a rural telephone company that would otherwise concentrate
primarily on providing PCS service in the rural portions of a BTA or MTA (which, according to SDN might be a commercially-attractive
strategy because of in densely-populated areas.

entity bidding credits. On the contrary, SDN contends that rural telephone companies should receive a greater bidding
credit than other entities, because they face higher service and construction costs. Accordingly, SDN maintains
that if accelerated build-out is to be included in the rural telephone company provision, an incentive should be provided
in the form of bonus credit over and above the standard bidding credit available to other designated entities.

we adopted a system of bidding credits for rural telephone companies designed to further promote the investment in

<FOOTCITE>154</FOOTCITE>
 We generally concluded that any special measures adopted for rural telephone companies, including bidding credits,
should be limited to bidding for licenses, in their rural service areas. We found that this limitation satisfied Congress'
objectives without unduly favoring rural telephone companies in markets where there was no compelling reason to
do so. Specifically, we concluded that Congress was primarily concerned with assuring rural consumers the benefits
of new technologies and providing opportunities for participation by rural telephone companies in the provision
of wireless services that supplement or replace their landline facilities.
<FOOTCITE>155</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, we provided that rural telephone companies would be eligible for bidding credits for specified licenses
only in their service areas.

109. However, unlike bidding credits available to women and minority-owned firms, we linked the amount of the bidding
credit for rural telephone companies to their commitment to achieve certain expanded infrastructure build-out
requirements in their rural service areas. We provided that the amount of the bidding credit would be proportionately
linked to the amount by which the rural telephone company agreed to expand its build-out commitment. In this regard,
we indicated that failure to meet the expanded build-out commitment would result in liability for a penalty in the
amount of the bidding credit, plus interest at the rate applicable to installment payments. We further provided that
grant of the licenses to rural telephone companies utilizing bidding credits would be conditioned upon payment of
this penalty, if and when it becomes applicable. We concluded that this added construction requirement would fulfill
the congressional objective of developing and rapidly deploying new services to those residing in rural areas.

, which links the availability of bidding credits for rural telephone companies to their agreement to satisfy an expanded
construction requirement, is necessary or appropriate to promote the statutory objectives. We agree with petitioners'
assertions that the expanded build-out requirement may have adverse consequences contrary to the purpose of bidding
credit provision. We are also concerned that the expanded construction requirement may be unduly burdensome both
to rural telephone company licensees and the Commission. In this regard, we are concerned that the accelerated build-out
requirement may not be economically feasible in some rural areas and thus may result in frequent forfeitures of the
bidding credit amount by rural telephone companies. As discussed more fully below, we now believe that Congress'
objectives of promoting investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services to rural areas will best
be achieved through the use of other provisions such as installment payments, bidding credits (without an expanded
build out requirement), and service area partitioning. Thus, we amend our rules to retain flexibility to adopt any
of these or other provisions for rural telephone companies on a service-specific basis after considering the characteristics
and capital requirements of the particular service.

 SDN, USIN, and NCTA all request that installment payments be extended to rural telephone companies regardless of
their status as small businesses. AIDE and Cook Inlet argue that all designated entities should be permitted to pay
for their licenses in installment payments irrespective of their size. These parties all object to the decision to
limit eligibility for installment payments to small businesses as defined in &sect;1.2110(b)(1), (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 companies with net worth including that of affiliates of $6 million or less and no more than $2 million of annual after-federal-tax
profit for the last two years). USIN argues that there is no statutory support in the provisions cited by the Commission
as authority for adopting different provisions for one designated entity group as opposed to another.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
112. Citing the legislative history to the Budget Act and H.R. Report No. 103&hyph;111 in particular, USIN also maintains
that the statutory purpose of requiring special provisions for designated entities was to promote entry by firms
with difficulty in obtaining access to capital. Petitioners maintain that the $6 million net worth/$2 million net
revenue standard for installment payment eligibility is too strict and will prevent rural telephone companies from
qualifying for the installment payment option although they face significant difficulty in obtaining access to
capital. USIN asserts that as a practical matter rural telephone companies may have high levels of non-amortized
assets and yet have less capital available for investment than many businesses that meet the small business definition.
SDN maintains that rural telephone companies should be eligible for installment payments regardless of whether
they qualify as small businesses because they will generally incur higher build out costs with lower revenue streams
than other designated entities. According to USIN, a rural telephone company bidding for a license in a capital-intensive
service should be eligible for installment payments if its annual revenue are under $100 million. USIN asserts that
without installment payments such telephone companies will be unable to bid for broad-coverage licenses as traditional
rural telephone company lenders have indicated unwillingness to finance auction bids.

all licenses. AIDE maintains that Congress did not intend to give the FCC discretion to offer special provisions to
some designated entities in some auctions but not in others. AIDE argues, moreover, that these limitations on the
availability of installment payments are not justified by the Commission's desire to prevent abuse of its designated
entity provisions since there are other safeguards designed specifically for that purpose, such as the rules for
disclosure of real parties in interest, the definitional requirements including the assets of affiliates and the
financial qualification rules.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the reasons set forth below, we deny petitioners' requests to expand the installment payment option to other designated
entities irrespective of their economic status. However, we will retain the flexibility to expand or modify the installment
payment option on a service-specific basis for other appropriately-sized entities where the spectrum costs and
capital infrastructure requirements necessitate their application to other entities. For example, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we recognized that the substantial expected capital required to acquire and construct broadband PCS licenses warranted
expansion of the installment payment option to most entities acquiring licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks.
<FOOTCITE>157</FOOTCITE>
 Under the broadband PCS rules, installment payments are available to smaller entities that do not technically qualify
as small businesses and an enhanced installment payment option is available to eligible small businesses and businesses
owned by women and/or minorities.

115. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we concluded that for some auctions, small businesses would be eligible for installment payments. We noted that by
allowing payment in installments, the government would be extending credit to an eligible winning bidder, thus reducing
the amount of private financing needed in advance of the auction by a prospective licensee. We noted that this will
assist small entities who are likely to have difficulty obtaining adequate private financing. As a result, we concluded
that installment payments would be an effective way to promote efficiently the participation of small businesses
in the provision of spectrum-based telecommunications service and an effective tool for efficiently distributing
licenses and services among geographic areas.
<FOOTCITE>158</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, we limited application of installment payments to small entities, including such entities that are owned by
minorities and/or women. We found that this approach best served the intent of Congress in enacting section 309(j)(4)(A),
to avoid a competitive bidding program that has the effect of favoring incumbents, with established revenue streams,
over new companies or start-ups.

116. Consistent with Congress's concern that auctions not operate to exclude small businesses, the provisions relating
to installment payments for minorities and/or women also were intended to assist only minorities and women who are
small businesses. The House Report states that these related provisions were drafted to ``ensure that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all small businesses 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
will be covered by the Commission's regulations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
including those owned by members of minority groups and women.

''

 (emphasis added). It also states that the provisions in section 309(j)(4)(A) relating to installment payments were
intended to promote economic opportunity by ensuring that competitive bidding does not inadvertently favor incumbents
with ``deep pockets'' ``over new companies or start-ups.''
<FOOTCITE>161</FOOTCITE>
 Because the Congressional objective here was to assist ``new companies or start-ups,'' we therefore concluded that
the Commission should use installment payments only for smaller sized entities. As indicated by the legislative
history, large entities with established revenue streams were not intended to be beneficiaries of this particular
means of financial assistance. We concluded that the statutory language, when read in conjunction with the legislative
history, does not indicate that Congress's purpose was to accord special financial assistance measures under section
309(j)(4)(A) to entities other than those with small economic status.
<FOOTCITE>162</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, we reject petitioner's proposals to allow installment payments for rural telephone companies or
other designated entities irrespective of their size. We will continue to determine on a service-specific basis
the appropriate economic eligibility criteria for installment payments. And we may, as we did in the context of broadband
PCS, establish different installment payment options for entities who face different economic barriers.

Under authority of Section 309(j)(4))(D), we have, however, afforded other types of financial assistance measures,
such as bidding credits, to other designated entities. See e.g., Third Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
in PP Docket No. 92&hyph;253, 59 FR 26741, May 24, 1994, at &para;&para;72&hyph;81 (which provides bidding credits

117. In addition, and consistent with our decision to limit installment payments to small entities, we decline to
make installment payments available for all licenses in all auctions. Rather, in order to match the provisions with
eligible recipients, we will continue to make installment payments available only for certain licenses that do not
involve the largest spectrum blocks and service areas. In this regard, in the context of narrowband PCS, we adopted
installment payments only for the regional, MTA and BTA licenses. Similarly, for broadband PCS, we limited eligibility
for installment payments to the BTA licenses contained in the entrepreneurs' blocks. We continue to believe that
where large, valuable blocks of spectrum are being auctioned we should not give ineligible entities the incentive
to create small business ``fronts,'' thereby enabling large businesses to become eligible for low-cost government
financing. Nor do we desire to delay service to the public by encouraging under-capitalized firms to receive licenses
for facilities which they may lack the resources adequately to finance.
<FOOTCITE>163</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, we will continue to allow installment payments only for licenses in those smaller spectrum blocks and
service areas that are most likely to match the business objectives of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
small entities in the context of a particular service. The particular spectrum block sizes that will be eligible for
installment payments will be decided in the context of each particular service taking into account the cost of acquiring
the spectrum and constructing the system.

119. Several commenters responding to the NPRM in this proceeding suggested that the Commission allow partitioning
of PCS licenses so as to permit rural telephone companies to hold licenses to provide service only in their service
areas.
<FOOTCITE>165</FOOTCITE>
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we recognized that partitioning may be an effective means to achieve Congress's goal of ensuring that advanced services
are provided in rural areas.
<FOOTCITE>166</FOOTCITE>
 In the context of broadband PCS, we adopted a system of geographic partitioning, for rural telephone companies which
allows rural telephone companies to acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses in one of two ways: (1) they may form
bidding consortia to participate in auctions, and then partition the licenses won among consortia participants,
or (2) they may acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses from other licensees through private negotiation and
agreement either before or after the auction (provided the partitioned area is reasonably related to the size of the
rural telephone company's rural service area).
<FOOTCITE>167</FOOTCITE>
 We require that partitioned areas conform to established geopolitical boundaries and that each area include the
wireline service area of the rural telephone company applicant. We believe that this system of partitioning of rural
service areas will provide a significant opportunity for many of these designated entities who desire to offer PCS
to their customers as a complement to their local telephone services. Therefore, we will retain the flexibility in
the generic auction rules to adopt a system of partitioning on a service-specific basis where the capital requirements
and construction costs are such that a system is necessary to assist rural telephone companies who cannot afford or
do not desire to bid for or construct systems for an entire service area.

 AIDE requests that when the Commission recaptures the benefits accruing to a designated entity pursuant to the unjust
enrichment provisions, the unjust enrichment penalty should credit the licensee's pre-sale investments in the
license and should be based on the portion of the licensee's taxable gain on the sale allocated to the license, with
appropriate adjustments. BET similarly requests that the Commission revise the unjust enrichment provisions to
credit the designated entity for its pre-transfer expenditures on the license including construction costs.

 We deny the requests of AIDE and BET. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission crafted unjust enrichment provisions designed to prevent designated entities from profiting by
the rapid sale of licenses acquired through the benefit of provisions and policies meant to encourage their participation
in the provision of spectrum-based services. These rules were intended to deter designated entities from prematurely
transferring licenses obtained through the benefit of provisions designed to create opportunities for such designated
entities in the provision of spectrum-based services. We sought through our unjust enrichment provisions to discourage
designated entities who do not intend to provide service to the public from abusing our provisions by obtaining a license
at a lower cost than other licensees and then selling the license after a short time to a non-designated entity at a profit.
In addition, the unjust enrichment rules were intended to recapture for the government a portion of the value of the
bidding credit or other special provision if such a designated entity prematurely transfers its licenses to an ineligible
entity, thereby frustrating the government's efforts to encourage the inclusion of designated entities in the provision
of new spectrum-based services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
122. We recognize that over time, a designated licensee may have made substantial investments in a license prior to
transfer. In order to reward efficiency and encourage such investments in infrastructure development, we provided
that we will generally reduce the amount of the recapture penalty as time passes or construction benchmarks are met.
<FOOTCITE>169</FOOTCITE>
 We further provided that our recapture provisions would not apply to the transfer or assignment of a license that has
been held for more than five years.
<FOOTCITE>170</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, where a recapture penalty is assessed, we stated that the penalty will not prevent the transferring designated
entity from recovering the depreciated value of its capital investment. Moreover, we indicated that in appropriate
circumstances, we might waive recapture ``if the licensee has incurred substantial start-up costs or made significant
capital investments with the intention of starting service, but due to circumstances beyond its control, was unable
to provide service.''

123. We believe that these measures adequately account for a designated entity's pre-transfer investments in a license,
including construction expenses. Therefore, we decline to adopt AIDE's proposal that we credit the licensee's pre-sale
investments in the license and base the recapture amount on the portion of the licensee's taxable gain on the sale allocated
to the license, because such provisions would require the government to undertake lengthy and complex accounting
and allocation proceedings to determine the amount of the penalty. Similarly, we deny BET's request that we credit
designated entities for their pre-transfer expenditures on a license because we believe that our recapture provisions
adequately account for these expenditures by reducing the amount of the penalty over time. Moreover, the unjust enrichment
provisions were designed to act as a penalty to deter premature license transfers by designated entities. Therefore
we decline to modify the recapture provisions adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We note, however, that because license terms and construction requirements vary by service, and because we may adopt
different designated entity provisions for different services, we will set forth the specific recapture provisions
in the service-specific competitive bidding rules of each auctionable service. Moreover, we modify our general
recapture provisions to provide flexibility on a service-specific basis to extend the duration of the recapture
provisions beyond five years.

 AIDE requests that the Commission reduce the amount of the upfront payment for designated entities. AIDE asserts
that a reduced upfront payment would help ensure that capital constrained designated entities have the opportunity
to participate in the competitive bidding process. According to AIDE, a reduced upfront payment is necessary to create
opportunities for designated entities to participate in competitive bidding and will allow such entities to preserve
their limited resources for post-auction infrastructure development.

Discussion.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission adopted an upfront payment requirement in order to ensure that only serious, qualified bidders participate
in our auctions. We reasoned that an upfront payment requirement would ensure the validity of the information generated
during auctions and increase the likelihood that licenses will be awarded to the qualified bidders who value them
the most, thus promoting the rapid deployment of new technology. Upfront payments will also provide the Commission
with a source of available funds in the event a bid withdrawal penalty must be assessed. By requiring a substantial
upfront payment amount, the Commission seeks to deter speculative and frivolous bidding by all bidders, including
designated entities. Moreover, the standard upfront payment formula ($.02 per MHz per pop for the maximum MHz-pops
a bidder intends to bid on in any single round of bidding), is based on the amount of spectrum and population coverage
on which a bidder seeks to bid and therefore is directly linked to the expected value of the license and anticipated
construction costs a licensee will incur.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we retained the flexibility to cap, reduce or modify the upfront payment amount for designated entities.
<FOOTCITE>172</FOOTCITE>
 We indicated that such decisions would be made in the service-specific competitive bidding rules for individual
services. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 recognizing that the standard upfront payment formula may create a barrier for smaller entities wishing to participate
in auctions, we reduced by 25 percent the upfront payment amount required for designated entities bidding in the entrepreneur's
blocks.
<FOOTCITE>173</FOOTCITE>
 Given the varied spectrum costs of different services, we will continue to consider such reduced upfront payments
for designated entities on a service-specific basis. Generally, we will only reduce the upfront payment amounts
for designated entities in capital intensive services, such as broadband PCS, where the spectrum bandwidth will
result in upfront payment amounts that may be prohibitive for some smaller entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we stated that, for some auctions, winning bidders that are small businesses would be eligible to use installment
payments in paying for licenses.

 We provided that for these winning bidders, a down payment of 10 percent would be due within five business days of the
close of the auction, and that an additional 10 percent would be due within five days of grant of the license.
<FOOTCITE>175</FOOTCITE>
 We stated that we would impose interest on installment payments at a rate equal to the rate for U.S. Treasury obligations
of maturity equal to the license term. We stated that the schedule of installment payments would begin with interest-only
payments for the first two years, and that thereafter principal and interest would be amortized over the remaining
term of the license.

128. Upon reconsideration, we have decided that we may need to tailor installment payment provisions more precisely
to needs of various groups of designated entities and the characteristics of particular services. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we provided installment payments for minorities and women in some blocks, and provided different installment provisions
for small businesses of different sizes.
<FOOTCITE>177</FOOTCITE>
 We will continue to establish different installment payment provisions on a service-specific basis. We may offer
installment payments to minorities and women, in some circumstances, and may offer installment payments having
differing terms to different classes of designated entities. We may vary the interest rate and the payment schedule
for installment payments, including the amount and timing of the down payment and the schedule for amortization of
principal and interest. Installment payment provisions for each service will be specified in Orders establishing
auction rules for that service. We believe that this additional flexibility will allow us to take account of differences
in capital requirements across services and license blocks, and to provide access to capital in ways that will give
various groups of designated entities a realistic chance to participate in offering service.

 Black Entertainment Television Holdings, Inc. (BET) requests that the FCC reconsider the public company restriction
on the availability of provisions for minority and women-owned companies in broadband PCS. BET argues that given
the costs of acquiring spectrum and the construction expense, such a limitation would defeat realistic opportunities
for a wide range of minority-owned firms. BET also requests that we clarify that provisions for minority and women-owned
firms are separate and distinct from provisions for small businesses. Finally, BET argues that rights, privileges,
options or other forms of ownership that do not affect the ability of a designated entity to control a company, or diminish
a designated entity financial stake in a venture, should not be considered in the definitional analysis for purposes
of determining eligibility.

 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we stated that publicly traded minority and women-owned companies would not be eligible for provisions applicable
to these designated entities. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 however, we deviated from this restriction to allow publicly traded minority and women-owned companies to qualify
to bid in the entrepreneurs' block, and under certain circumstances to qualify for bidding credits.
<FOOTCITE>178</FOOTCITE>
 We will continue to consider exceptions to our restriction on publicly traded company eligibility for minority and
women-owned businesses on a service-specific basis, in each case considering the capital requirements and the expected
build-out cost of the service. We agree with BET that in services with high entry costs, precluding publicly traded
companies from receiving measures intended for minority and women-owned businesses may undermine our objective
of ensuring the opportunity for these designated entities to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services.

131. As requested by BET, we clarify that the provisions for businesses owned by women and minorities are separate
and distinct from the provisions for small businesses. Thus, women and minority-owned businesses may qualify for
measures adopted for these entities irrespective of their size, and small businesses may qualify for small business
provisions regardless of their ownership by minorities and women. And small businesses that are owned by members
of minorities and/or women may qualify for provisions applicable to both groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
132. Finally, in the general auction rules, we indicated that in determining designated entity eligibility we would
consider all rights, warrants and options on a fully diluted basis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, they will be treated as if already exercised.
<FOOTCITE>179</FOOTCITE>
 We intend to maintain the existing rule of calculating these ownership interests on a fully diluted basis, since we
expect that such ownership interests will almost always have the potential either to impact the ability of a designated
entity to control a company or to diminish a designated entity's financial stake in the venture. However, in the rare
circumstance where such ownership interests have no effect on a designated entity's ability to control a firm or to
diminish the designated entity's financial stake, we will consider requests for waivers.
<FOOTCITE>180</FOOTCITE>
 We note, however, that we expect such instances to be rare, and petitioners will be required to make an affirmative
showing sufficient to overcome the presumption that such ownership interests should be calculated as if exercised
for purposes of determining eligibility issues.

 AIDE and Cook Inlet propose stricter eligibility and anti-sham measures to avoid designated entity shams. Specifically,
Cook Inlet proposes requiring that a designated entity maintain clear structural control of an entity in order to
be eligible for designated entity provisions. In this regard, Cook Inlet argues that in limited partnerships, the
general partner should be required to be a designated entity and restrictions should be imposed on the ability of other
general partners to exercise management control. Cook Inlet also proposes that the Commission require designated
entities to document their eligibility by attaching documentation to their long form application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
134. We agree with AIDE that in some instances stricter eligibility requirements are appropriate to ensure that only
legitimate designated entities are the beneficiaries of the special provisions established under our rules. In
particular, we clarify that, when an applicant or a licensee is a partnership, because each general partner generally
has the ability to act on behalf of the partnership, all general partners in the license applicant must be designated
entities in order to qualify for designated entity status. We believe that this clarification is consistent with
the Commission's long-standing practice of attributing control in the context of partnerships to the general partners.
This clarification will ensure that designated entities in partnerships retain 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as well as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
135. In addition, we agree with AIDE that documentation of designated entity status should be submitted along with
the applicants' long-form applications in order to enable the Commission to verify designated entity eligibility.
Accordingly, we will require designated entities to substantiate their eligibility by describing on their long-form
application how they satisfy the requirements for eligibility. We will also require designated entity applicants
to list on their long-form application all agreements that effect designated entity status, such as all partnership
agreements, shareholder agreements, management agreements and other agreements, including oral agreements,
which establish that the designated entity will have both 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control of the entity. In addition, we will require that such information be maintained at the licensee's facilities,
or by its designated agent, for the term of the license, and that the information be made available to Commission staff
upon request in order to enable the Commission to audit designated entity eligibility on an ongoing basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
136. In addition, if an applicant for designated entity status proves unqualified, and the Commission determines
that the application for designated entity status involved willful misrepresentation or other serious misconduct,
the Commission will impose severe penalties. These may include monetary forfeitures, revocation of licenses, and
prohibition of participation in future auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
137. With respect to AIDE's proposal that clear structural control should be required to establish designated entity
eligibility, we believe that as a general rule, our strict requirement that women and minority principals control
the applicant and maintain a 50.1 percent voting interest (in a corporate applicant) and a 50.1 percent equity stake
in the entity is sufficient to prevent ``fronts'' and to ensure that our provisions are only made available to legitimate
qualified designated entities. However, we reserve the flexibility on a service-specific basis, taking into account
the nature of the specific provisions applicable in that service, to adopt additional or different requirements
for designated entity eligibility.

 we allowed minority or women-owned broadband PCS applicants to sell up to 75 percent of the company's equity to passive
investors so long as the control groups retained control and 25 percent of the equity and each other investor owned
less than 25 percent of the passive equity. We also established control group tests for small businesses and entities
that wished to bid in certain blocks.

NTCA and USIN request that we amend the small business definition so that it can be flexibly modified in the context
of a particular service. NTCA and USIN advocate that such flexibility is appropriate because the existing $6 million
net worth/$2 million net income test is too low to reflect the capital-intensive nature of the broadband PCS business.
NTCA asserts that most telephone companies are unable to meet this test even though they have few subscribers and few
employees. USIN states that the current definition discriminates against small rural telephone companies, and
that the proper measure for small businesses in capital-intensive service is those with annual revenues of less than
$100 million.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with NTCA. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we relied on the Small Business Administration's (SBA) standard definition. The SBA definition permits an applicant
to qualify for financial assistance based on a net worth not in excess of $6 million with average net income after Federal
income taxes for the two preceding years not in excess of $2 million.
<FOOTCITE>182</FOOTCITE>
 The record in this proceeding reflected broad disagreement about the appropriate definition of small businesses.
Many commenters, including the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA, argued that the SBA net worth/revenue definition
was too restrictive and would exclude businesses of sufficient size to survive, much less succeed, in the competitive
wireless communications marketplace. The SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy and Suite 12 Group advocated adoption
of a revenue test, arguing that a net worth test could be misleading as some very large companies have low net worth.
The SBA's Chief Counsel recommended that the revenue standard be raised to include firms that (together with affiliates)
have less than $40 million in revenue. The SBA Chief Counsel suggested that the Commission consider a higher revenue
ceiling or adopt different size standards for different telecommunications markets.

Some parties recommend using the SBA's 1500 employee standard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
comments of SBA Associate Administrator for Procurement Assistance at 2, CFW Communications at 2, and Iowa Network
at 17. A number of other commenters argue, however, that adoption of this alternative SBA definition would open up
a huge loophole in the designated entity eligibility criteria. Specifically, they contend that telecommunications
is a capital, rather than labor, intensive industry, and that an entity with 1,500 employees is likely to be extremely
well capitalized and have no need for the special treatment outlined by Congress in the Budget Act. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
141. Other parties indicated that the definition used by the Commission might impede the ability of small businesses
to raise capital in anticipation of auctions. They noted that many small firms are soliciting investors to enable
these firms to compete better in auctions, and argued that their designated entity status should not be jeopardized
as a result. Thus, these commenters suggested, if the FCC adopts the SBA's net worth standard, the net worth valuation
should relate back to the date of the PCS Final Report and Order (September 23, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
142. In contrast, several commenters argue that the small business definition must be made more restrictive in order
to prevent large firms from spinning off companies to compete as designated entities. In this regard, some parties
recommend limiting provisions to those small businesses that were in existence for the previous two years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
143. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we adopted the existing SBA net worth/net income size standard as the generic threshold for small businesses to qualify
as designated entities because at that time we were unable to conclude that the other proposals suggested by commenters
were superior to this established standard. However we acknowledged that for certain telecommunications industry
sectors this standard may not be high enough to encompass those entities that require the benefits, but also have the
financial wherewithal to construct and operate the systems. Accordingly, we indicated that this ``threshold could
be adjusted upward on a service-by-service basis to accommodate such situations.'' We also noted that we may modify
the small business definition if the SBA changed its definition or the Commission determined that an alternative
definition was more appropriate for capital intensive services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
144. In this regard, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we revised the definition of a small business set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to include entities with up to $40 million in gross revenues, and we provided that these small businesses would permit
to pool their resources and form consortia to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks or to receive other small business benefits.
We also adopted rules that allow small businesses and businesses owned by women and/or minorities to raise capital
by selling passive ownership interests in their companies. Thus, for example, under certain conditions, businesses
owned by women and minorities have the option of taking on one large passive partner (holding up to 49.9 percent of the
enterprise) or selling a greater portion of their companies' equity (up to 75 percent of the equity) to passive investors
in smaller increments. Either of these structures should enhance the ability of these entities to obtain the necessary
funding to meet long-term construction, operation and expansion goals.

145. Given the diversity of services that may be subject to competitive bidding and the varied spectrum costs and build-out
requirements associated with each, we conclude that it is more appropriate to define the eligibility requirements
for small businesses on a service-specific basis, taking into account the capital requirements of each particular
service in establishing the appropriate threshold. Therefore we will amend our generic auction rules to replace
the small business definition with a provision enabling the Commission to establish a small businesses definition
in the context of each particular service.

does not apply to applications in the cellular radio service, such as cellular unserved area applications, that were
filed prior to July 26, 1993;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Specialized Mobile Radio Service (SMR) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR Part 90, Subpart S) including applications based on finder's preferences for frequencies allocated to the

Competitive bidding design options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Commission will select the competitive bidding design(s) to be used in auctioning particular licenses or
classes of licenses on a service-specific basis. The choice of competitive bidding design will generally be made
pursuant to the criteria set forth in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;61, adopted March 8, 1994, available
for purchase from the International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M St. NW, suite 140, Washington, DC 20037,
telephone (202) 857&hyph;3800, but the Commission may design and test alternative methodologies. The Commission
will choose from one or more of the following types of auction designs for services or classes of services subject to
competitive bidding: (1) Single round sealed bid auctions (either sequential or simultaneous); (2) Sequential
oral auctions; (3) Simultaneous multiple round auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations
of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid,
a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be
used with any type of auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses
and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in
conjunction with any type of auction.

Withdrawal, Default and Disqualification Penalties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As specified below, when the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round auction pursuant to &sect;1.2103,
the Commission will impose penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, or who default
on payments due after an auction closes or who are disqualified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws a high bid during the course of an auction will be
subject to a penalty equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the
license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds
the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing
bidder has deposited with the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. If a high bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close
of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be subject to the penalty in paragraph (g)(1) plus an additional penalty
equal to 3 percent of the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid
amount, the 3 percent penalty will be calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount. These amounts will be
deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the defaulting or disqualified bidder has deposited with
the Commission. When the Commission conducts single round sealed bid auctions or sequential oral auctions, the Commission
may modify the penalties to be paid in the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification; provided, however,
that such penalties shall not exceed the penalties specified above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The Commission will generally release information concerning the identities of bidders before each auction
but may choose, on an auction-by-auction basis, to withhold the identity of the bidders associated with bidder identification
numbers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Commission may delay, suspend, or cancel an auction in the event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle,
evidence of security breach, unlawful bidding activity, administrative necessity, or for any other reason that
affects the fair and efficient conduct of the competitive bidding. The Commission also has the authority, at its sole
discretion, to resume the competitive bidding starting from the beginning of the current or some previous round or
cancel the competitive bidding in its entirety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to be eligible to bid, an applicant must timely submit a short-form application (FCC Form 175), together with
any appropriate filing fee set forth by Public Notice. Unless otherwise provided by Public Notice, the Form 175 need
not be accompanied by an upfront payment (see &sect;1.2106).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All Form 175s will be due:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) On the date(s) specified by Public Notice; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of application filing dates which occur automatically by operation of law (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see, e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 47 CFR 22.902), on a date specified by Public Notice after the Commission has reviewed the applications that have
been filed on those dates and determined that mutual exclusivity exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Form 175 must contain the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Identification of each license on which the applicant wishes to bid;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The applicant's name, if the applicant is an individual. If the applicant is a corporation, then the short-form
application will require the name and address of the corporate office and the name and title of an officer or director.
If the applicant is a partnership, then the application will require the name, citizenship and address of all partners,
and, if a partner is not a natural person, then the name and title of a responsible person should be included as well.

above, then it must identify and describe itself and its principals or other responsible persons;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The identity of the person(s) authorized to make or withdraw a bid;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If the applicant applies as a designated entity pursuant to &sect;1.2110, a statement to that effect and a declaration,
under penalty of perjury, that the applicant is qualified as a designated entity under &sect;1.2110.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Certification that the applicant is legally, technically, financially and otherwise qualified pursuant to
Section 308(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The Commission will accept applications certifying
that a request for waiver or other relief from the requirements of Section 310 is pending;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Certification that the applicant is in compliance with the foreign ownership provisions of Section 310 of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Certification that the applicant is and will, during the pendency of its application(s), remain in compliance
with any service-specific qualifications applicable to the licenses on which the applicant intends to bid including,
but not limited to, financial qualifications. The Commission may require certification in certain services that
the applicant will, following grant of a license, come into compliance with certain service-specific rules, including,
but not limited to, ownership eligibility limitations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Certification under penalty of perjury that it has not entered and will not enter into any explicit or implicit

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to cure defects specified herein (except for failure
to sign the application and to make certifications) and to resubmit a corrected application. Form 175 may be amended
or modified to make minor changes or correct minor errors in the application (such as typographical errors). The Commission
will classify all amendments as major or minor, pursuant to rules applicable to specific services. An application
will be considered to be a newly filed application if it is amended by a major amendment and may not be resubmitted after
applicable filing deadlines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Applicants who fail to correct defects in their applications in a timely manner as specified by Public Notice will
have their applications dismissed with no opportunity for resubmission.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prohibition of Collusion.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, after the filing of short-form applications,
all bidders are prohibited from cooperating, collaborating, discussing or disclosing in any manner the substance
of their bids or bidding strategies, or discussing or negotiating settlement agreements, with other bidders until
after the high bidder makes the required down payment, unless such bidders are members of a bidding consortium or other
joint bidding arrangement identified on the bidder's short-form application pursuant to &sect;1.2105(a)(2)(viii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Applicants may modify their short-form applications to reflect formation of consortia or changes in ownership
at any time before or during an auction, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant,
and provided that the parties forming consortia or entering into ownership agreements have not applied for the same
license. Such changes will not be considered major modifications of the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) after the filing of short-form applications, applicants may make agreements to bid jointly for licenses, provided
the parties to the agreement have not applied for the same license.

Submission of upfront payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Commission may require applicants for licenses subject to competitive bidding to submit an upfront payment.
In that event, the amount of the upfront payment and the procedures for submitting it will be set forth in a Public Notice.
No interest will be paid on upfront payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Upfront payments must be made either by wire transfer or by cashier's check drawn in U.S. dollars from a financial
institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the
Federal Communications Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If an upfront payment is not in compliance with the Commission's Rules, or if insufficient funds are tendered to
constitute a valid upfront payment, the applicant shall have a limited opportunity to correct its submission to bring
it up to the minimum valid upfront payment prior to the auction. If the applicant does not submit at least the minimum
upfront payment, it will be ineligible to bid, its application will be dismissed and any upfront payment it has made
will be returned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The upfront payment(s) of a bidder will be credited toward any down payment required for licenses on which the bidder
is the high bidder. Where the upfront payment amount exceeds the required deposit of a winning bidder, the Commission
may refund the excess amount after determining that no bid withdrawal penalties are owed by that bidder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d), in the event a penalty is assessed pursuant to &sect;1.2104
for bid withdrawal or default, upfront payments or down payments on deposit with the Commission will be used to satisfy
the bid withdrawal or default penalty before being applied toward any additional payment obligations that the high
bidder may have.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) After bidding has ended, the Commission will identify and notify the high bidder and declare the bidding closed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within five (5) business days after being notified that it is a high bidder on a particular license(s), a high bidder
must submit to the Commission's lockbox bank such additional funds (the ``down payment'') as are necessary to bring
its total deposits (not including upfront payments applied to satisfy penalties) up to twenty (20) percent of its
high bid(s). (In single round sealed bid auctions conducted under &sect;1.2103, however, bidders may be required
to submit their down payments with their bids.) This down payment must be made by wire transfer or cashier's check drawn
in U.S. dollars from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
and must be made payable to the Federal Communications Commission. Winning bidders who are qualified designated
entities eligible for installment payments under &sect;1.2110(d) are only required to bring their total deposits
up to ten (10) percent of their winning bid(s). Such designated entities must pay the remainder of the twenty (20) percent
down payment within five (5) business days of grant of their application. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 &sect;1.2110(e) (1) and (2). Down payments will be held by the Commission until the high bidder has been awarded the
license and has paid the remaining balance due on the license, in which case it will not be returned, or until the winning
bidder is found unqualified to be a licensee or has defaulted, in which case it will be returned, less applicable penalties.
No interest will be paid on any down payment.

(c) A high bidder that meets its down payment obligations in a timely manner must, within ten (10) business days after
being notified that it is a high bidder, submit an additional application (the ``long-form application'') pursuant
to the rules governing the service in which the applicant is the high bidder (unless it has already submitted such an
application, as contemplated by &sect;1.2105(a)(1)(b). For example, if the applicant is high bidder for a license
in the Interactive Video Data Service (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR Part 95, Subpart F), the long form application will be submitted on FCC Form 574 in accordance with &sect;95.815
of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision in title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary,
high bidders need not submit an additional application filing fee with their long-form applications. Notwithstanding
any other provision in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary, the high bidder's long-form application
must be mailed or otherwise delivered to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Attention:
Auction Application Processing Section, 1919 M Street, N.W., Room 222, Washington, D.C. 20554.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant that fails to submit the required long-form application as required under this subsection, and fails
to establish good cause for any late-filed submission, shall be deemed to have defaulted and will be subject to the
penalties set forth in &sect;1.2104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) As an exhibit to its long-form application, the applicant must provide a detailed explanation of the terms and
conditions and parties involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other agreement or arrangement
it had entered into relating to the competitive bidding process prior to the time bidding was completed. Such agreements
must have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form applications pursuant to &sect;1.2105.

Procedures for filing petitions to deny against long-form applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Where petitions to deny are otherwise provided for under the Act or the commission's Rules, and unless other service-specific
procedures for the filing of such petitions are provided for elsewhere in the Commission's Rules, the procedures
in this section shall apply to the filing of petitions to deny the long-form applications of winning bidders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within thirty (30) days after the Commission gives public notice that a long-form application has been accepted
for filing, petitions to deny that application may be filed. Any such petitions must contain allegations of fact supported
by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) An applicant may file an opposition to any petition to deny, and the petitioner a reply to such opposition. Allegations
of fact or denials thereof must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The
times for filing such opposition and replies will be those provided in &sect;1.45.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the Commission determines that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) an applicant is qualified and there is no substantial and material issue of fact concerning that determination,
it will grant the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) an applicant is not qualified and that there is no substantial issue of fact concerning that determination, the
Commission need not hold a evidentiary hearing and will deny the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) substantial and material issues of fact require a hearing, it will conduct a hearing. The Commission may permit
all or part of the evidence to be submitted in written form and may permit employees other than administrative law judges
to preside at the taking of written evidence. Such hearing will be conducted on an expedited basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Unless otherwise specified in these rules, auction winners are required to pay the balance of their winning bids
in a lump sum within five (5) business days following award of the license. Grant of the license will be conditioned
on full and timely payment of the winning bid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If a winning bidder withdraws its bid after the Commission has declared competitive bidding closed or fails to
remit the required down payment within five (5) business days after the commission has declared competitive bidding
closed, the bidder will be deemed to have defaulted, its application will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the
default penalty specified in &sect;1.2104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission may either re-auction the license
to existing or new applicants or offer it to the other highest bidders (in descending order) at their final bids. The
down payment obligations set forth in &sect;1.2107(b) will apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A winning bidder who is found unqualified to be a licensee, fails to remit the balance of its winning bid in a timely
manner, or defaults or is disqualified for any reason after having made the required down payment, will be deemed to
have defaulted and will be liable for the penalty set forth in &sect;1.2104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission will
conduct another auction for the license, affording new parties an opportunity to file applications for the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Bidders who are found to have violated the antitrust laws or the Commission's rules in connection with their participation
in the competitive bidding process may be subject, in addition to any other applicable sanctions, to forfeiture of
their upfront payment, down payment or full bid amount, and may be prohibited from participating in future auctions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women. Unless otherwise provided in rules governing specific
services, a business owned by members of minority groups and/or women is one in which minorities and/or women who are
U.S. citizens control the applicant, have at least 50.1 percent equity ownership and, in the case of a corporate applicant,
a 50.1 percent voting interest. For applicants that are partnerships, every general partner either must be a minority
and/or woman (or minorities and/or women) who are U.S. citizens and who individually or together own at least 50.1
percent of the partnership equity, or an entity that is 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women
who are U.S. citizens. The interests of minorities and women are to be calculated on a fully-diluted basis; agreements
such as stock options and convertible debentures shall be considered to have a present effect on the power to control
an entity and shall be treated as if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised. However, upon a demonstration
that options or conversion rights held by non-controlling principals will not deprive the minority and female principals
of a substantial financial stake in the venture or impair their rights to control the designated entity, a designated
entity may seek a waiver of the requirement that the equity of the minority and female principals must be calculated
on a fully-diluted basis. The term minority includes individuals of African American, Hispanic-surnamed, American
Eskimo, Aleut, American Indian and Asian American extraction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Rural telephone companies. A rural telephone company is any local exchange carrier including affiliates (as
defined in 1.2110(b)(4)), with 100,000 access lines or fewer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Affiliate. (i) An individual or entity is an affiliate of an applicant or of a person holding an attributable interest
in an applicant under &sect;24.709 (both referred to herein as ``the applicant'') if such individual or entity_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) is directly or indirectly controlled by the applicant, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) is directly or indirectly controlled by a third party or parties that also controls or has the power to control the
applicant, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) has an ``identity of interest'' with the applicant.

control 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in determining affiliation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Every business concern is considered to have one or more parties who directly or indirectly control or have the
power to control it. Control may be affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so long as the
power to control exists.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant owning 50 percent of the voting stock of another concern would have negative power to control such concern
since such party can block any action of the other stockholders. Also, the bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder
with less than 50 percent of the voting stock to block any actions taken by the other stockholders in the other entity.
Affiliation exists when the applicant has the power to control a concern while at the same time another person, or persons,
are in control of the concern at the will of the party or parties with the power to control.

(B) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of director, officer or key employee positions; contractual
or other business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key employee is an employee who, because
of his/her position in the concern, has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations or management
of the concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Control can arise through management positions where a concern's voting stock is so widely distributed that no
effective control can be established.

Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In a corporation where the officers and directors own various size blocks of stock totaling 40 percent of the corporation's
voting stock, but no officer or director has a block sufficient to give him or her control or the power to control and
the remaining 60 percent is widely distributed with no individual stockholder having a stock interest greater than
10 percent, management has the power to control. If persons with such management control of the other entity are persons
with attributable interests in the applicant, the other entity will be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Identity of interest between and among persons. Affiliation can arise between or among two or more persons with
an identity of interest, such as members of the same family or persons with common investments. In determining if the
applicant controls or has the power to control a concern, persons with an identity of interest will be treated as though
they were one person.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Two shareholders in Corporation Y each have attributable interests in the same PCS application. While neither shareholder
has enough shares to individually control Corporation Y, together they have the power to control Corporation Y. The
two shareholders with these common investments (or identity in interest) are treated as though they are one person
and Corporation Y would be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Spousal Affiliation. Both spouses are deemed to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or controlled
by either of them, unless they are subject to a legal separation recognized by a court of competent jurisdiction in
the United States. In calculating their net worth, investors who are legally separated must include their share of
interests in property held jointly with a spouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Kinship Affiliation. Immediate family members will be presumed to own or control or have the power to control interests
owned or controlled by other immediate family members. In this context ``immediate family member'' means father,
mother, husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law, brother-
or sister-in-law, step-father or -mother, step-brother or -sister, step-son or -daughter, half brother or sister.
This presumption may be rebutted by showing that the family members are estranged, the family ties are remote, or the
family members are not closely involved with each other in business matters.

Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A owns a controlling interest in Corporation X. A's sister-in-law, B, has an attributable interest in a PCS application.
Because A and B have a presumptive kinship affiliation, A's interest in Corporation Y is attributable to B, and thus
to the applicant, unless B rebuts the presumption with the necessary showing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) Affiliation through stock ownership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern if he or she owns or controls or has the power
to control 50 percent or more of its voting stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern even though he or she owns, controls or
has the power to control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the block of stock he or she owns, controls
or has the power to control is large as compared with any other outstanding block of stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a
concern, such minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the aggregate of these minority holdings
is large as compared with any other stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons individually
controls or has the power to control the concern; however, such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control
or power to control, in fact, does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge. Stock options, convertible
debentures, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are generally considered to have a present
effect on the power to control the concern. Therefore, in making a size determination, such options, debentures,
and agreements are generally treated as though the rights held thereunder had been exercised. However, an affiliate
cannot use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its control over another concern before it actually
does so.

Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If company B holds an option to purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds an attributable interest in
a PCS application, the situation is treated as though company B had exercised its rights and had come owner of a controlling
interest in company A. The gross revenues of company B must be taken into account in determining the size of the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% (70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who holds an attributable
interest in a PCS application, and gives a third party, SmallCo, an option to purchase 50 of the 70 shares owned by BigCo,
BigCo will be deemed to be an affiliate of company A, and thus the applicant, until SmallCo actually exercises its option
to purchase such shares. In order to prevent BigCo from circumventing the intent of the rule which requires such options
to be considered on a fully diluted basis, the option is not considered to have present effect in this case.

Example 3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

If company A has entered into an agreement to merge with company B in the future, the situation is treated as though the
merger has taken place.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(vi) Affiliation under voting trusts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Stock interests held in trust shall be deemed controlled by any person who holds or shares the power to vote such
stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at
will or to replace the trustee at will.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary,
the stock interests held in trust will be deemed controlled by the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If the primary purpose of a voting trust, or similar agreement, is to separate voting power from beneficial ownership
of voting stock for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to control a concern in order that such concern or
another concern may meet the Commission's size standards, such voting trust shall not be considered valid for this
purpose regardless of whether it is or is not recognized within the appropriate jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Affiliation through common management. Affiliation generally arises where officers, directors, or key employees
serve as the majority or otherwise as the controlling element of the board of directors and/or the management of another
entity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Affiliation through common facilities. Affiliation generally arises where one concern shares office space
and/or employees and/or other facilities with another concern, particularly where such concerns are in the same
or related industry or field of operations, or where such concerns were formerly affiliated, and through these sharing
arrangements one concern has control, or potential control, of the other concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Affiliation through contractual relationships. Affiliation generally arises where one concern is dependent
upon another concern for contracts and business to such a degree that one concern has control, or potential control,
of the other concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Affiliation under joint venture arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A joint venture for size determination purposes is an association of concerns and/or individuals, with interests
in any degree or proportion, formed by contract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single, specific business
venture for joint profit for which purpose they combine their efforts, property, money, skill and knowledge, but
not on a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally. The determination whether an entity is
a joint venture is based upon the facts of the business operation, regardless of how the business operation may be designated
by the parties involved. An agreement to share profits/losses proportionate to each party's contribution to the
business operation is a significant factor in determining whether the business operation is a point venture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The parties to a joint venture are considered to be affiliated with each other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The Commission may set aside specific licenses for which only eligible designated entities, as specified by the
Commission, may bid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The Commission may permit partitioning of service areas in particular services for eligible designated entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The Commission may permit small businesses (including small businesses owned by women, minorities, or rural
telephone companies that qualify as small businesses) and other entities determined to be eligible on a service-specific
basis, which are high bidders for licenses specified by the Commission, to pay the full amount of their high bids in
installments over the term of their licenses pursuant to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Unless otherwise specified, each eligible applicant paying for its license(s) on an installment basis must deposit
by wire transfer or cashier's check in the manner specified in &sect;1.2107(b) sufficient additional funds as are
necessary to bring its total deposits to ten (10) percent of its winning bid(s) within five (5) business days after
the Commission has declared it the winning bidder and closed the bidding. Failure to remit the required payment will
make the bidder liable to pay penalties pursuant to &sect;1.2104(g)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Within five (5) business days of the grant of the license application of a winning bidder eligible for installment
payments, the licensee shall pay another ten (10) percent of the high bid, thereby commencing the eligible licensee's
installment payment plan. Failure to remit the required payment will make the bidder liable to pay penalties pursuant
to &sect;1.2104(g)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Upon grant of the license, the Commission will notify each eligible licensee of the terms of its installment payment
plan. Unless other terms are specified in the rules of particular services, such plans will:

(i) impose interest based on the rate of U.S. Treasury obligations (with maturities closest to the duration of the
license term) at the time of licensing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) allow installment payments for the full license term;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) begin with interest-only payments for the first two years; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) amortize principal and interest over the remaining term of the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A license granted to an eligible entity that elects installment payments shall be conditioned upon the full and
timely performance of the licensee's payment obligations under the installment plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If an eligible entity making installment payments is more than ninety (90) days delinquent in any payment, it shall
be in default.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Upon default or in anticipation of default of one or more installment payments, a licensee may request that the
Commission permit a three to six month grace period, during which no installment payments need be made. In considering
whether to grant a request for a grace period, the Commission may consider, among other things, the licensee's payment
history, including whether the licensee has defaulted before, how far into the license term the default occurs, the
reasons for default, whether the licensee has met construction build-out requirements, the licensee's financial
condition, and whether the licensee is seeking a buyer under an authorized distress sale policy. If the Commission
grants a request for a grace period, or otherwise approves a restructured payment schedule, interest will continue
to accrue and will be amortized over the remaining term of the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Following expiration of any grace period without successful resumption of payment or upon denial of a grace
period request, or upon default with no such request submitted, the license will automatically cancel and the Commission
will initiate debt collection procedures pursuant to Part 1, Subpart O.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Commission may award bidding credits (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 payment discounts) to eligible designated entities. Competitive bidding rules applicable to individual services
will specify the designated entities eligible for bidding credits, the licenses for which bidding credits are available,
the amounts of bidding credits and other procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The Commission may establish different upfront payment requirements for categories of designated entities
in competitive bidding rules of particular auctionable services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The Commission may offer designated entities a combination of the available preferences or additional preferences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Designated entities must describe on their long-form applications how they satisfy the requirements for eligibility
for designated entity status, and must list and summarize on their long-form applications all agreements that effect
designated entity status, such as partnership agreements, shareholder agreements, management agreements and
other agreements, including oral agreements, which establish that the designated entity will have both

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control of the entity. Such information must be maintained at the licensees' facilities or by their designated agents
for the term of the license in order to enable the Commission to audit designated entity eligibility on an ongoing basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The Commission may, on a service-specific basis, permit consortia, each member of which individually meets the
eligibility requirements, to qualify for any designated entity provisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise permitted under the Commission's
Rules) of a license within three years of receiving a new license through a competitive bidding procedure must, together
with its application for transfer of control or assignment, file with the Commission's statement indicating that
its license was obtained through competitive bidding. Such applicant must also file with the Commission the associated
contracts for sale, option agreements, management agreements, or other documents disclosing the local consideration
that the applicant would receive in return for the transfer or assignment of its license. This information should
include not only a monetary purchase price, but also any future, contingent, in-kind, or other consideration (

Unjust enrichment payment: set-aside.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As specified in this paragraph an applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise permitted
under the Commission's Rules) of a license acquired by the transferor or assignor pursuant to a set-aside for eligible
designated entities under &sect;1.2110(c), or who proposes to take any other action relating to ownership or control
that will result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity, must seek Commission approval and may be required
to make an unjust enrichment payment (Payment) to the Commission by cashier's check or wire transfer before consent
will be granted. The Payment will be based upon a schedule that will take account of the term of the license, any applicable
construction benchmarks, and the estimated value of the set-aside benefit, which will be calculated as the difference
between the amount paid by the designated entity for the license and the value of comparable non-set-aside license
in the free market at the time of the auction. The Commission will establish the amount of the Payment and the burden
will be on the applicants to disprove this amount. No payment will be required if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The license is transferred or assigned more than five years after its initial issuance, unless otherwise specified;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed transferee or assignee is an eligible designated entity under &sect;1.2110(c) or the service-specific
competitive bidding rules of the particular service, and so certifies.

 An applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise permitted under the Commission's
Rules) of a license acquired by the transferor or assignor through a competitive bidding procedure utilizing installment
financing available to designated entities under &sect;1.2110(d) will be required to pay the full amount of the remaining
principal balance as a condition of the license transfer. No payment will be required if the proposed transferee or
assignee assumes the installment payment obligations of the transferor or assignor, and if the proposed transferee
or assignee is itself qualified to obtain installment financing under &sect;1.2110(d) or the service-specific
competitive bidding rules of the particular service, and so certifies.

credits available to eligible designated entities under &sect;1.2110(e) or who proposes to take any other action
relating to ownership or control that will result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity, must seek Commission
approval and will be required to make an unjust enrichment payment (Payment) to the government by wire transfer or
cashier's check before consent will be granted. The Payment will be the sum of the amount of the bidding credit plus
interest at the rate applicable for installment financing in effect at the time the license was awarded.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document recommends adopting a proposal to have the Class II milk price in all Federal orders be the basic formula
price for the second preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.30. The Class II price would, like the Class I price
in all Federal orders, be announced on or before the fifth day of the month and apply to milk marketed during the following
month. This recommended decision would also eliminate the ``add-back'' provision that requires that the difference
between the Class II price and the Class III price be added to a subsequent month's Class II price when the Class II price
for the month falls below the Class III price.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small
entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amendments
would promote more orderly marketing of milk by producers and regulated handlers.

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling.

Findings and Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following findings and conclusions on the material issues are based on evidence presented at the hearing and the
record thereof: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Class II milk price. A proposal to replace the Class II milk price formula with the basic formula price for the second
preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.30 should be adopted. Further, this price will be announced by the
fifth day of the preceding month. Thus, for example, the Class II price delivered by producers in September would be
announced on August 5, and would be the M&hyph;W price for July plus $0.30. Adoption of this proposal will result in
the Class II milk price and the Class I milk price being announced at the same time and being applicable for all Federal
milk orders. Adoption of this proposal would eliminate the need to retain in Federal milk orders the section providing
for the basic Class II formula price. Adoption of this proposal also eliminates the ``add-back'' provision of current
Class II pricing where, for a given month, if the Class II price is less than the Class III price for the same month, the
difference between these prices are ``added-back'' in computing the second succeeding month's Class II price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For most Federal milk orders, the current Class II milk price is the Minnesota-Wisconsin (M&hyph;W) price for the
second preceding month as adjusted by an ``updating'' product price formula (the basic Class II formula price provisions
of those orders), plus an amount by which the simple average of the basic formula prices (M&hyph;W prices) for the most
recent 12-month period, plus ten cents, exceeds the same 12-month period's average of the basic Class II formula prices.
The Class II milk price is announced by the 15th of the previous month. However, if the announced Class II price for a
given month is less than the Class III price for the same month, the difference between these prices is ``added-back''
in computing the second succeeding month's Class II price. This feature is often referred to as the ``add-back'' provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the basic Class II formula price (Section 51a in most orders) is to provide a mechanism for updating the
M&hyph;W price for the second preceding month so that the Class II price for the current month can be based on the M&hyph;W
price but still reflect more current marketing conditions that might indicate forthcoming changes in the M&hyph;W
price. This updating is done by comparing movements of wholesale prices for butter, nonfat dry milk, and Cheddar cheese
during the first 15 days of the preceding month with such prices during the same period a month earlier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current Class II differential, which is included in the Class II milk price, in most orders is 10 cents. A 15-cent
differential applies under the three Florida orders, and a 25-cent differential applies under the Pacific Northwest
order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal recommended for adoption was proposed by the Milk Industry Foundation and International Ice Cream Association
(MIF/IICA) and the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), Proposal One as published in the hearing notice. The
MIF/IICA are national trade associations for processors of fluid milk, cultured dairy products, and manufacturers
of frozen desert products. The MIF comprises some 220 member companies who operate nearly 500 plants nationwide and
process about 80 percent of all the Class II cultured dairy products in the United States. The IICA comprises some 186
member companies who operate about 350 plants nationwide that manufacture, as well as distribute, approximately
85 percent of the ice cream and related frozen products consumed in the United States. The NMPF is the national farm
commodity organization that represents dairy producers and the dairy cooperative marketing associations they
own and operate. The Federation's members produce a substantial majority of the U.S. milk supply and market milk in
all Federal milk order areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second proposal, Proposal Two as published in the hearing notice, was offered by Friendship Dairies, Inc. Like the
proposal recommended for adoption, this proposal would replace the Class II price formula with the basic formula
price for the second preceding month, but would add a fixed differential of $0.10 instead of $0.30. Announcement of
the Class II milk price under this proposal would also be by the fifth day of the preceding month. Friendship Dairies,
Inc. (Friendship), is a family owned and operated cultured dairy products manufacturer regulated under the New York-New
Jersey (Order 2) marketing area and processes most of the 250 million pounds of milk which it receives annually from
about 175 independent producers and milk marketing cooperatives in Class II products such as cottage cheese and yogurt.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third proposal, Proposal Three as published in the hearing notice, was offered by Women Involved in Farm Economics
(WIFE). This proposal would replace the Class II price formula with the basic formula plus a fixed differential of
$0.50. No witness from WIFE testified. However, testimony was received by a witness from the National Farmers Organization
(NFO) in support of a $0.50 Class II differential. The NFO represents about 4,000 member dairy farmers and others who
market their milk through NFO in at least 13 Federal milk orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fourth proposal, Proposal Four as published in the hearing notice, would replace the Class II price formula with
a Class II price of $0.60 above the Class III or Class III-A price, whichever was higher. This proposal received no evidence
or testimony at the hearing and is considered abandoned.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fifth proposal, Proposal Five as published in the hearing notice, proposed including the ``add-back'' provision
in the Class II price calculation. Retention of the ``add-back'' provision was proposed by the Central Milk Producers
Cooperative (CMPC), a federation of milk cooperatives with operations in the Chicago Regional (Order 30) marketing
area. Its membership includes: Associated Milk Producers, Inc., Bongards Creameries, Inc., Golden Guernsey Dairy
Cooperative, Independent Milk Producers Cooperative, Land O'Lakes, Inc., Manitowoc Milk Producers Cooperative,
Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., Midwest Dairymen's Company, Milwaukee Cooperative Milk Producers, National Farmers
Organization, Southern Milk Sales, Inc., Wisconsin Dairies Cooperative, Wisconsin Milk Producers Cooperative,
Inc., and the Woodstock Progressive Milk Producers Association. Members of CMPC supply milk to bottlers with Class
I and Class II utilization in Federal Orders 30, 32, 40, 50, 68, and 79. They also supply milk to primarily ``stand alone''
Class II plants in Federal Orders 30, 33, and 49. Certain CMPC members also operate plants processing Class I and Class
II products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testimony in support of adopting Proposal One, which would replace the Class II price formula with the basic formula
price for the second preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.30 and be announced by the fifth day of the preceding
month, included:

Except for supporting the fifth proposal, which would retain the ``add-back'' provision, the CMPC offered testimony
in support of replacing the Class II price formula with the basic price formula for the second preceding month plus
a fixed differential of $0.30, with this price being announced by the fifth day of the preceding month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testimony offered by the proponent witness for the MIF/IICA cited that price volatility in Federal order markets
in the past few years has resulted in the movement of Class II prices in a magnitude and direction too often in the opposite
direction of Class I and Class III prices. The witness indicated that these more volatile and opposite-moving price
relationships have acted to severely limit Class II processors in their ability to sell products on a forward contract
basis and have caused confusion to their customers who possess a relatively limited knowledge of milk procurement
and pricing. This witness maintains that for efficient marketing and efficient pricing of milk, both Class I and Class
II prices should be reflecting movements in the M&hyph;W price at the same time, in the same magnitude, and in the same
direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MIF/IICA proponent witness offered testimony that revisited a proposal that they submitted at the National Hearing
in the fall of 1990 to change the method for establishing advance notice of the price paid for Class II milk under Federal
orders. At that hearing, the proposal offered was to establish a Class II price by using the M&hyph;W price for the second
preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.15, explaining that the rationale for establishing a 15-cent differential
was based on a comparison of the Class II price with the basic formula price over the decade of the 1980's. The proponent
witness observed that for the 10-year period of 1980 through 1990 the Class II price averaged about $0.15 above the
M&hyph;W price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness also testified that because of the Food Security Act of 1985, and the subsequent 1990 Farm Bill, the groundwork
was laid for basing milk prices on market forces more than had been done in the past. The MIF/IICA witness contends that
the result has been more volatile milk pricing which has rendered the current Class II price formula ineffective in
tracking the Class I price, and that the spread between the Class II and the M&hyph;W price has increased from its longer-term
average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proponent witness testified that the Class II price has on average approximated the basic formula price for the
second preceding month plus 30 cents. It is on this basis that, according to the proponent witness, they are endorsing
a Class II price based on the basic formula price for the second preceding month plus a 30-cent fixed differential.
They maintain that this approach has the advantage of being easily understood and is revenue-neutral when compared
to the current Class II price computation. They noted that it also allows for the announcement of the Class II price
for the month to be made a full ten days earlier than under the current Class II pricing and announcement structure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From an economic point of view, the MIF/IICA proponent witness stressed that while revising the price computation
for determining the Class II price is certainly needed, it is imperative not to have a Class II price which would increase
the probability of reducing an already declining market for Class II product sales. Because the Class II price has
averaged nearly 30 cents above the basic formula price for the second preceding month over the past six years, the witness
asserted that the level of the Class II price for raw milk to both processors and producers would be maintained. The
witness offered and cited Federal order statistics that supported their position that Class II product sales are
steady-to-declining. The witness said this underscores the economic need to maintain the cost of Class II milk at
its current level relative to the basic formula price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the MIF/IICA proponent witness testified that the changing cost structure of milk components under Federal
orders reinforces their position of a fixed 30-cent differential added to the second preceding month's basic formula
price in determining the Class II milk price. The witness noted that since 1990, the butter price has been reduced under
the Federal price support program while the cost of nonfat dry milk has risen. Noting also that the butterfat differential
computation was changed in mid-1990, these two developments have significantly increased the cost structure for
Class II products, particularly for lower to nonfat Class II products.

The NMPF witness offered testimony and evidence in support of the testimony of the MIF/IICA position. The witness
compared the actual Class II price each month under the Chicago Regional order with what the Class II price would have
been under their alternative proposal for the six-year period from 1988 to 1993. These comparisons on average, the
witness said, would neither have increased handler's costs nor have changed prices received by dairy farmers. This
proponent witness maintained that this alternative proposal would have generated more stable prices over the past
six years and that the range between monthly high and low prices would have been less than the actual Class II price range.
According to the witness, their proposal assures that monthly fluctuations in Class I and Class II prices will be identical.
Also, according to the NMPF witness, under the current Class II pricing formula, Class I and Class II prices could,
and often did, move in opposite directions in the same month. They maintained that consistent movements in Class I
and Class II prices would lessen confusion and mitigate marketing problems that arise when Class I and Class II prices
move in opposite directions in the same month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NMPF proponent witness testified that their proposed alternative for determining the Class II milk price is simple,
easy to understand, and can be calculated as soon as the basic formula price is announced by the USDA. In addition to
joining the MIF/IICA position in support of Proposal One, this witness asserted that based on data for the past six
years, adoption of their proposal would result in no changes in either Class II prices paid by handlers or prices received
by producers. Additionally, this witness observed that there would be little overall price impact, but prices would
be more stable, and market conditions would improve.

The witness for Prairie Farms Dairy, Inc., offered testimony in support of the need to adopt the MIF/IICA and NMPF's
Class II pricing proposal. This witness offered testimony supporting the proponents' observations of the pricing
problems and business impacts that occur when Class I and Class II prices move in different directions in the same month.
This witness attributes, in part, the decline in sales of Class II products to the wide price swings of the Class II price
and how retailers have reacted to these swings. The Prairie Farms witness asserted that adoption of the MIF/IICA and
NMPF proposal would not negatively affect farmers, that returns to processors would be more constant, and that consumers
would see a more stable average price on Class II products, which might result in increased sales.

The Prairie Farms witness viewed the 10-cent differential as a ``nuisance'' differential and summarized their opinion
in four major points in support of Proposal One: (1) that the proposal is supported by the majority of the dairy industry;
(2) the proposal would result in a 10-day earlier announcement of the Class II price along with the Class I price, which
would simplify price changes to customers in a more timely manner; (3) that Class I and Class II prices will move in the
same direction and at the same magnitude; and (4) that Class II price swings will be more moderate, resulting in more
stable consumer prices that hopefully will increase Class II product sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness representing Kroger Company testified to their support for the MIF/IICA and NMPF proposal, offering
that adoption of the proposal will enable processors to intelligently inform their customers of changes in costs
for Class I and Class II products simultaneously. This witness similarly expressed concern of a declining Class II
products market. In support of the fixed 30-cent differential feature for Class II pricing, the Kroger witness maintained
that the value of Class II milk to dairy farmers is greater than the intended target differential of ten cents contained
in the current Class II pricing formula. This witness also asserted that it is important to establish a pricing level
which recognizes these market realities. He maintained that a 30-cent Class II differential added to the basic formula
price recognizes the increased value of Class II milk and establishes a competitive price level for Class II products.
The Kroger witness testified that this proposal would, over time, establish revenue neutrality with the current
Class II pricing method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness for Crowley Foods, testifying in support of the MIF/IICA and NMPF proposal, voiced identical concerns
about Class I and Class II price relationships and went further to mention that the 30-cent fixed differential also
offers a happy medium between the price concerns of producers and processors. Additionally, the Crowley Foods witness
said that announcing the Class II price an additional ten days in advance of the current Class II price announcement
would afford improved promotional planning and ensure that Class II prices move in tandem with fluid prices.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness representing the CMPC offered testimony in support of Proposal One. However, CMPC sees the need to retain
the ``add-back'' feature of Class II milk pricing. Hence, their support as proponents for Proposal Five. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CMPC witness emphasized the role of Class II products in the market place, offering evidence that customers demand
the same basic product and equal service levels (and costs) for their Class II milk as with Class I milk. However, this
witness testified, the current Class II pricing system does not generate adequate returns to pay for the costs of service
so closely associated with Class I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This witness offered evidence in support for a 30-cent differential, indicating it is the minimum justifiable differential
level. However, the witness tempered support for this level with concern that in no event should such apparent increase
in the Class II differential be permitted to result in no real price increase, hence their support for the fifth proposal
for retention of the ``add-back.'' The impetus for retaining the add-back provision offered by the CMPC witness drew
from the Recommended Decision of October 31, 1989 (54 FR 33709) that concluded that Class II milk should not be less
than the value for Class III milk. Although the CMPC witness acknowledged that a Class II differential increase without
an add-back feature would lessen the risk of loss to producers, they continue to assert that the add-back provision
provides the necessary guaranty against such loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The brief filed by CMPC elaborated further on their support for retention of the add-back provision. In their view,
the add-back provides the month-to-month guaranty against lost revenue to producers. This is necessary to retain,
stated the CMPC brief, because producer and handler prices are computed on a month-to month basis and not on the basis
of annual, or three year or six year average prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Support for Proposal One was offered in a brief filed on behalf of the Southern Foods Group, Inc. (SFG), and Anderson-Erickson
Dairy Company (AE). The SFG owns and operates six fluid processing plants in Texas and Louisiana and processes Class
II products. The AE operates a fluid processing plant and an ice cream plant in Des Moines, Iowa. In the opinion of SFG/AE,
only Proposal One provides the changes necessary to correct the problems currently associated with Class II milk
pricing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SFG/AE brief points to producer and handler agreement that Class II pricing needs to move in the same direction
and at the same rate as Class I prices and that advance pricing of Class II milk is critical to the ability of the industry
to sell finished Class II products. They also point out that there is universal agreement that the existing Class II
price formula is unacceptable and that Class II pricing should be based on the Minnesota&hyph;Wisconsin (M&hyph;W)
price series. On the basis of the record, the SFG/AE concludes that the Class II price must be based on the second prior
month's M&hyph;W plus a differential of not more than thirty cents without an add-back. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testimony offered in support of Proposal Two, which would establish the Class II price as the basic formula price for
the second preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.10 and have this price announced by the fifth day of the preceding
month, was received from: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The proponent, Friendship Dairies, Inc.; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Kraft General Foods, a large handler of producer milk that operates plants that process Class II and Class III products
in many states; and

c. Galloway Company, a regulated handler under Federal Order 30 that primarily produces sweetened condensed milk,
and ice cream mixes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proponent witness representing Friendship Dairies, Inc., offered testimony on the need for the Class II differential
to be set at ten cents, and for the ``add-back'' provision of current Class II milk pricing to be eliminated. The testimony
offered in support of their proposal rested largely on prior decisions issued by the Department which had determined
that ten cents above the basic formula price was the appropriate price (differential) level for Class II milk. Additionally,
this proponent witness agreed with other testimony that eliminating the Class II product price formula and using
the second preceding month's basic formula price would more accurately reflect the true direction or magnitude in
the movement of the Class III price and simplify the pricing of Class II milk. This witness emphasized that this distortion
was most attributable to the ``add-back'' provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Friendship witness offered testimony that demonstrated that the add-back provision resulted in price enhancement
of the Class II price above the intended 10-cent target differential. Additionally, this witness testified that
when the Class II price is dramatically higher than the Class III&hyph;A price, the economic incentive exists for
using nonfat dry milk (NFDM) in place of fresh fluid milk. According to this witness, while increasing the price of
Class II milk may increase the blend price producers receive in the short term, the long-term effect will be to promote
the use of NFDM for manufacturing Class II products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if the Class II price had not increased, said the Friendship witness, the decreasing value placed on butterfat
has had the effect of increasing the cost of a hundredweight of Class II skim milk. Because the cost of milk is the single
most significant factor affecting the price of most finished Class II products, especially cottage cheese, this
absolute increase in cost is staggering and sales have declined, said the witness. According to the witness, any resulting
decline in the use of milk for skim-based Class II products would yield a lower price to dairy farmers and would compound
the continuing shift of milk value from the fat to skim component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Friendship witness applauded the advance pricing feature of Class II milk, he asserted that the add-back
provision of current Class II pricing effectively obliterates any benefits of advance pricing, citing that prices
have become volatile. This volatility has caused confusion in the marketplace because Class II prices too often move
completely independent of the Class III and Class I price, according to this witness. The result of this confusion,
said the witness, is manufacturers attempting to quote a price based upon a forecast, only to rescind because of a large
movement in prices due to the add-back feature of current Class II milk pricing. This reality, said the witness, has
implications at the consumer level because special featured prices on products that are offered to supermarket chains
to promote sales must be guaranteed well in advance so that advertising and related promotional business can be planned.
The witness sees the result of current pricing practices as lower Class II product sales and lower returns to dairy
farmers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Friendship witness testified that their proposal achieves the Department's intent that the Class II price be
Class III plus ten cents. The witness said that adoption of any other proposal would deviate from this intent. Further,
said the witness, supply and demand conditions, at least in Order 2, do not warrant any increase in the Class II price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Support for the 10-cent differential level for Class II milk was offered from Kraft General Foods (Kraft). The Kraft
witness testified that current Class II pricing has not achieved the targeted Class II differential of ten cents above
the Class III price. Rather, it has exceeded the intended differential, and the difference has been compounded in
recent years. On a month-to-month basis, said Kraft, the advance Class II price formula has resulted in gross distortions
between the Class II and Class III price in the amount of difference and the direction of price movements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Kraft witness expressed disagreement with the MIF/IICA and NMPF proposal only from the view that the appropriate
differential level should be ten cents and not thirty cents. The witness noted that current Class II pricing has resulted
in an effective Class II differential level of almost thirty cents. This is not what should be adopted as the Class II
differential because the effective thirty cents is a result of the failure of the formula used to compute the Class
II price, he said. According to the Kraft witness, it is one thing to achieve enhancement of the minimum regulated price
by mistake and quite another to do so by design. Like the Friendship witness, the Kraft witness drew heavily on previous
decisions that reiterated that the appropriate Class II price be the Class III price plus ten cents. This witness was
of the opinion that supply and demand conditions did not warrant any increase in the current target differential.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like the Friendship witness, the Kraft witness joined in the concern that if the Class II differential level is increased
above the current intended 10-cent level, there would likely be increased substitution of NFDM for fluid milk in Class
II products. Kraft also agreed with Friendship that the add-back provision should be eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness from Galloway Company offered testimony in support of Proposal Two. Much of this witness's testimony
supported testimony of the Friendship and Kraft witnesses and further elaborated on the concern for the substitution
of NFDM for fluid milk in the manufacture of Class II products. Noting the wide price disparity between Class III&hyph;A
and Class II, this witness said that processors will make their ingredient selection based on arbitrary and capricious
pricing regulations if the Class II price is increased. Increasing the Class II price would not enhance producer revenue
because of the ability to substitute lower-priced ingredients in the manufacture of Class II products.

A brief filed on behalf of Friendship, Kraft, Galloway Company, and the Sorrento Cheese Company, Buffalo, New York,
expressed opposition to the 30-cent differential of Proposal One. This brief maintained that the appropriate differential
should be ten cents and that placing the differential at thirty cents would be undue price enhancement of the Class
II price and would only institutionalize an unintended aberration from the target differential. They contend that
testimony of the proponents of Proposal One is flawed because it is based on the Class II prices that prevailed in 1990
when the M&hyph;W price recorded some of its lowest prices in a decade and because of the effects of the add-back provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This brief cites past decisions that affirm that the current target 10-cent differential is appropriate, although
because of the add-back provision, the target differential could not be met and this resulted in high Class II prices.
It further revisits past decisions wherein concern was expressed that producer milk may not be made available for
Class II use if the price falls below the Class III price. While experience has not borne this out, they say, caution
still needs to be exercised in the relationship of Class II prices to Class III-A prices and substitution of powder
for producer milk in the manufacture of Class II products. Increasing the differential would only provide additional
stimulus to reduce handler purchases of producer milk. This brief also counters arguments on the role of over-order
premiums, maintaining that such payments reflect the cost of services incurred by producers (such as balancing and
transportation) and not the value of milk. They contend that such premiums should not be relevant to the raw product
value of milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the brief asserts that Proposal One's differential of thirty cents is an undue enhancement of the Class II
price and has no basis from an economic point-of-view. The view presented is that thirty cents represents a differential
of convenience between divergent views and is not arrived at on the basis of supply and demand considerations which,
they say, any price change must be predicated upon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In support of Proposal Three, a witness representing NFO testified that in addition to supporting a 50-cent Class
II differential, they were also supporting the CMPC proposal that the add-back provision of current Class II pricing
be retained. This witness testified that the record of the previous 43-day National Hearing in 1990 clearly supported
a Class II differential of at least fifty cents. The witness indicated that if the classified pricing structure of
Federal orders is to be of value, then there has to be meaningful price differences between classes. A class price break
of only ten cents between Class III and Class II was not meaningful in the view of this witness. Additionally, said the
NFO witness, handlers are already paying much more than the effective 30-cent Class II differential to secure Class
II milk supplies, perhaps as much as $0.70 to $0.80 cents above Class III is regularly being paid. According to this
witness, this indicates that the value of Class II milk is worth at least 50 cents over the Class III price. The NFO brief
further emphasized that 50 cents establishes a differential level which is at least minimally significant in a classified
price sense. Since Federal milk orders have three classes, then there should be a difference in the use value among
the three categories of products sufficient enough to justify separate classes, said NFO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another reason offered by the NFO witness for a 50-cent Class II differential is the devaluation of butterfat relative
to the nonfat component of milk. Because Class II products have a significant butterfat content when viewed across
all Class II products, Class II milk producers have suffered losses in milk used in this class, and this represents
a reduction in costs to processors. This argument was reiterated in their brief.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NFO witness testified that even though they would like to see a $1.00 Class II differential, a 50-cent level should
be sufficient, provided that the add-back be retained to maintain the intent that Class II prices be equal to or above
Class III prices. If the differential level were set at $1.00, the NFO witness testified that this would negate the
need for an add-back because of the unlikelihood that the Class III price would exceed the Class II price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their brief, the NFO revisited past decisions that affirmed the establishment and intended role of the add-back
provision. The NFO reasserted that the add-back provides reinforcement to the principle that Class II prices by definition
should not be less than Class III prices. The culprit in the volatility of Class II prices, according to NFO, is the basic
Class II formula price and not the add-back. However, NFO did acknowledge that the add-back does play a role, albeit
a minor one, in Class II price volatility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Opponents to retaining the add-back provision argued in submitted briefs that it should be eliminated for a number
of reasons. All opponents agreed that if the Class II milk pricing method adopts using the second preceding month's
basic formula price and adding a fixed differential, then the add-back can only serve to enhance the Class II price.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SFG/AE brief dismisses concern that producers won't deliver milk for Class II use if the Class II price falls below
the Class III price. In addition to this not happening in the marketplace, SFG/AE points out, it is also a function of
when the price is announced. Producers don't know until the month is over that the Class II price was below the Class
III price. Therefore, no purpose beyond price enhancement is served by an add-back provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This theme is further developed in a brief filed on behalf of Friendship. While CMPC views a ``loss'' to producer revenues
without retaining the add-back, there is in effect no ``loss'' Friendship argues. Class II prices below Class III
prices arise only during months in which the cheese-driven M&hyph;W price is increasing, said Friendship. In periods
of falling M&hyph;W prices, the Class II differential will exceed the target differential. Producers will not be
denied the benefit of the Class II differential_rather its payment is delayed by two months, they said. In periods
of M&hyph;W price volatility, the fact that Class I and Class II differentials would be added to the M&hyph;W prices
for the second preceding month will actually serve to restrain, they said, the extent to which such volatility is reflected
in producer prices. Further, the Friendship brief finds it inconsistent to call Class II prices below Class III prices
a ``loss'' because it is not balanced against any concept of gain or a ``pay-back'' in months of a declining M&hyph;W
and the effective Class II differential at windfall levels above the M&hyph;W. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is clear from the record that there is universal endorsement for changing how Class II milk is priced under Federal
orders. The record supports the conclusion that the basic Class II price formula that ``updates'' the second preceding
month's M&hyph;W in establishing the Class II price is not functioning as intended; is no longer necessary and contributes,
in part, to price volatility; and results in a distorted relationship with other class prices. The record is also clear
on the unanimous support for retaining the advance-pricing of Class II milk and that the Class II price should be announced
at the same time as Class I prices by using the second preceding month's M&hyph;W price and adding a fixed differential.
The only issues of disagreement regarding Class II milk pricing are what is the appropriate Class II differential
and whether or not the ``add-back'' provision should be retained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most handlers and producers agree that the appropriate differential value for Class II milk is at least thirty cents
above the Class III price. The record testimony and evidence supports this conclusion on the basis that this differential
value is representative of the additional value of milk used in this class; that it has been the effective differential
paid for Class II milk on average since 1987; and that handlers regularly pay over-order premiums to secure milk for
Class II uses above and beyond the service feature of over-order premiums.

Past decisions regarding the pricing of Class II milk concluded that the basic Class II formula price and target differential
of ten cents should not be changed. The most recent past decision concluded that the target differential of ten cents
should be maintained because supply and demand conditions revealed that there were adequate reserves of Class III
milk to meet Class II needs. That decision on the 43-day National Hearing of 1990 recognized that many in the industry
believed that Class II prices should move in the same magnitude and direction as Class I. That decision and this hearing
clearly reveal that Class I and Class II products are frequently processed together and marketed by handlers in common
distribution channels. However, with a basic differential of ten cents, the decision on the 1990 43-day National
Hearing continued the existing theory of coordinating the Class II price with the current month's Class III price
because Class III products could be used as a source of ingredients for Class II products. In this regard, the need to
coordinate the Class II price with the Class III price was the operative principle in the pricing of Class II milk. It
was for these reasons that the updating product price formula (represented by the basic Class II formula price) was
intended and retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This decision makes a clear break from the past in that Class II milk pricing will function in a manner consistent with
Class I pricing largely in recognition of the similarity of the distribution and marketing channels shared by milk
used in both classes. The record testimony and evidence in this hearing support the conclusion that current Class
II pricing results in prices that do not always move in the same direction and magnitude as Class I prices even though
both products tend to move in the same marketing channels. Linking the Class II pricing method to that of Class I should
better reflect and respond to market conditions as well as simplify the procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the brief by CMPC, the Class II price is driven largely by changes in the basic formula price_the M-W
price. As this price changes through movements in the hard product price markets, so will the Class II price. Therefore,
any change in the Class II price is due primarily to hard product market forces, and not due to the level of the differential
which will not change from month-to-month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By establishing the Class II milk price at the second preceding month's M-W and adding a fixed differential, as with
Class I prices, the intent of providing coordination with Class I prices is achieved. Additionally, a consistent
and predictable relationship between Class I and Class II prices is also achieved. However, because of the need to
retain advance pricing for orderly marketing, there may be times when the current month's Class III price will be greater
than the Class II price. Inversely, it is also true, that there may be times when the Class II price is more than 30-cents
greater than the current month's Class III price. Nevertheless, the intended target differential is maintained,
as with Class I pricing, albeit with a lag as exists with Class I pricing. This is a reality that both producers and handlers
must accept with the retention of advanced pricing and have accepted with regard to the Class I price for many years.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record on this hearing expressed concern for the substitution of NFDM for fresh producer milk used to make Class
II products because the price relationship between the Class II price and, for most Federal orders, the Class III-A
price, may provide the economic incentive to do so. In this regard, there was a call on one hand to have the Class II price
be coordinated with the movement in Class I price and at the same time have the Class II price also be coordinated with
lower-class prices. The impossibility of this is clear. In addition, both handlers and producers will know, in advance,
the prices for both Class I and Class II milk at the same time. Delivery, procurement, and processing decisions can
be made with surety of what prices will be. However, the Class III or Class III-A price will not be known until after the
month has ended. It would seem that without knowing what the Class III or Class III-A price will be in advance, the argument
that NFDM will substitute for producer milk is weakened. This is not to say that substitution will not occur, because
the record reveals that it does. Substitution may occur if a handler predicts the future price relationship between
the Class II price and Class III or Class III-A price, and predicts that the future relationship will provide the economic
incentive for substitution. Economic prediction, in and of itself, is not a proper basis for determining the appropriate
value the milk has in Class II uses.

Significantly different conclusions were reached between the proponents of retaining the current 10-cent target
differential, the proponents for a 30-cent differential, and the proponents for a 50-cent differential on the basis
of the changing value of milk components. The 10-cent proponents argue that the increasing value of skim to butterfat
effectively has raised the costs of Class II products. The 30-cent proponents argue that the changing cost structure
provides, in part, the rationale for maintaining what the recent past's average differential has been. The proponents
for a 50-cent differential argue that because the utilization of butterfat to manufacture Class II products is relatively
high, processors enjoy a price decrease. The arguments presented on the changing cost structure of milk components
is not an issue for the purposes of establishing the Class II price. Rather, it is a butterfat differential issue that
has already been decided upon in other rulemaking decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the brief submitted by SFG/AE, Federal order statistics reveal that there is an abundant supply of
milk for all class uses of producer milk. As indicated in this brief, and in the brief filed on behalf of Friendship,
Kraft, Sorrento Cheese Company, and Galloway Company, a price increase must be predicated upon supply and demand
considerations. Establishing the Class II differential for any given month at thirty cents above the second preceding
month's basic formula price is not intended to effectuate a price increase or a price decrease for Class II milk. Rather
it is a recognition of the effective differential that has been functioning for a long period of time. The record provides
no evidence on any difficulty in procuring milk for Class II use under the current pricing structure. However, the
record does indicate that the pricing structure creates problems regarding the timing and certainty of prices, in
part, because of its reliance on the basic Class II pricing formula used to update the M&hyph;W. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An analysis of the record evidence and officially noticed materials does point to the fact that the Class II price has
averaged nearly thirty cents above the basic formula price for the second preceding month since 1987. Additionally,
an analysis of the effective differential (the difference between the current month's Class III price and Class II
price since adoption of the add-back provision) for the four-year period of 1990 through 1993 indicates that the Class
II differential has averaged thirty cents above the Class III price. It is because of these market realities that there
exists so strong an agreement between producers and processors that the true differential level of thirty cents for
Class II milk is warranted. Some describe this differential level as the appropriate level, some the minimum justifiable
differential, and by some, a differential level that represents the maximum that can be called for on the basis of supply
and demand considerations.

The Add-Back Provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only two proponents, CMPC who supported a 30-cent differential, and NFO, who advocated a 50-cent differential, called
for retention of the add-back provision. The add-back provision of current Class II milk pricing was established
in December 1989 as part of a decision to have true advanced pricing for Class II milk. Prior to that time, the Class II
milk price that was announced was a tentative price which could be retroactively updated when the Class III price for
the month was greater than the tentative Class II price. In this way, the Class II price was ``floored'' by the Class
III price. The intent of the add-back provision was to maintain in principle this relationship between Class II and
Class III prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision on the 43-day National Hearing of 1990 recognized that, at the time of the hearing, the effective Class
II differential had averaged about 4 cents higher than the intended differential of ten cents per hundredweight.
This decision also affirmed the intent of the add-back was to ensure that producers not receive less than the Class
III value for Class II milk in the blend price when the basic formula price exceeded the announced Class II price so that
returns to producers would not be reduced. In this way, the Class II price was coordinated with the current month's
Class III price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now that there exists much more pricing data under the current Class II pricing method, it is clear that the effect of
the add-back provision resulted in a Class II price that can never achieve the intended target differential. While
the goal of the add-back was to provide a degree of coordination with the Class III price, it did not attempt price coordination
with the Class III price in months when the effective Class II differential was well above the targeted differential.
Retention of the add-back feature for any proposal presented at this hearing would have similar results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The add-back provision similarly does not balance prices paid by handlers in months when producers receive more (and
at times much more) than the intended target differential. In this view, the add-back feature only works to the price
advantage of the producer who, because of the unintended effect of a pricing provision, enjoys all protection from
market price changes that handlers do not.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To retain the add-back provision under the proposal recommended for adoption herein could only result in increasing
the minimum Class II milk price. An analysis of what the Class II price would have been with and without an add-back provision
reveals that in 1990 the add-back would have enhanced the effective Class II differential by 19 cents; for 1991 it would
have enhanced the Class II differential by 24 cents; for 1992 it would have enhanced the Class II differential by 15
cents; and for 1993 the Class II differential would have been enhanced by 34 cents. Additionally, because this decision
makes a clear break from the past in that Class II prices are more importantly coordinated with the Class I price, there
remains no rational argument for its retention. The need for advance pricing, as well as the need for coordination
with Class I price movements, means moving away from price coordination with the current month's Class III price.
Both objectives can not be simultaneously satisfied.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document invites written comments on a proposal to revise the supply plant shipping standards under the Eastern
Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order for the months of September 1994 through February 1995. The proposal would reduce
shipping percentages for pool supply plants by 10 percentage points for each month during the requested period. The
temporary revision was requested by Brewster Dairy, Inc., a proprietary handler who operates a pool supply plant.
The handler contends that the action is necessary to prevent inefficient and uneconomic movements of milk.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
rule would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy farmers
would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions
of &sect;1036.7(f) of the order, the temporary revision of certain provisions of the order regulating the handling
of milk in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania marketing area is being considered for the months of September 1,
1994, through February 28, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All persons who desire to submit written data, views or arguments about the proposed revision should send two copies
of their views to USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456,
Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456 by the 7th day after publication of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The period for filing comments is limited to 7 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete
the required procedures and include September 1994 in the temporary revision period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division
during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).

Statement of Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions proposed to be revised are the supply plant shipping percentages for the months of September 1994 through
February 1995. The proposed action would reduce the amount of milk that supply plants must ship to pool distributing
plants by 10 percentage points.

Currently, the order provides that for a supply plant to be considered a pool plant, a minimum percentage of the total
quantity of milk received at the supply plant must be transferred or diverted to and physically received at pool distributing
plants regulated under the order. The minimum percentages are: 40 percent for September, October, and November;
30 percent for December; and 35 percent for January and February. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order provides that the Director of the Dairy Division may increase or decrease
the percentage delivery requirement by up to 10 percentage points if the Director finds that such revision is necessary
to obtain needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision was requested by Brewster Dairy, Inc. (Brewster), a proprietary handler who operates a pool supply plant
regulated under the order. Brewster contends that in Fall 1993 the plant was unable to accept surplus distributing
plant milk associated with Order 36 and still meet supply plant qualifications. Consequently, milk from a distributing
plant located 10 miles from Brewster had to be diverted to a manufacturing facility 92 miles away. At the same time,
Brewster had to procure surplus milk from greater distances to fulfill manufacturing obligations. Brewster contends
that this situation represents inequitable and inefficient movements of milk for both supply and distributing plants,
undertaken to meet order shipping requirements. Brewster asserts that the same inequitable and inefficient movements
of milk are expected again for Fall 1994. Thus, Brewster contends, a reduction of supply plant shipping percentages
is necessary to prevent uneconomic and inefficient shipments of milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the current supply and demand relationship, it may be necessary to reduce the supply plant shipping percentage
requirements as proposed to provide for the efficient and economic marketing of milk during the months of September
1, 1994, through February 28, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and maintain an inspection program designed to assure consumers
that poultry and poultry products distributed in commerce or within designated States are wholesome, not adulterated,
and are properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Under this authority, FSIS regulates the labeling of poultry and
poultry products and has established a policy on the use of the term ``fresh'' on the labeling of poultry products.
The current U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) policy permits poultry kept at or below 40
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and above 0
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to be labeled as ``fresh.'' This policy is based on Federal regulations that set temperatures, and chilling
and freezing procedures for poultry products, and the labeling of such products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of California enacted a State law (Section 26661 of the California Food and Agriculture Code) restricting
the use of the term ``fresh'' on the labels of poultry that has ever been kept at or below 25
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. Three trade organizations filed suit to prevent enforcement of the California law, claiming, among other
things, that it was preempted by the PPIA. Federal preemption authority granted in the PPIA prohibits States from
imposing requirements on the labeling of poultry products that are in addition to, or different than, Federal labeling
requirements. On April 8, 1994, a United States District Judge ruled that the labeling provision in the California
law was preempted by Federal law and permanently enjoined the State from enforcing its law. The USDA, at the judge's
request, filed an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
amicus curiae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 brief on the Federal preemption issue. A Federal appellate court, which heard argument on the appeal, has not yet ruled.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of issues raised by the California law and the litigation, the Secretary of Agriculture directed FSIS to
reexamine its policy for the use of the term ``fresh'' on the labeling of raw poultry products. The Secretary stated
that the current labeling policy in this area should be reexamined to ensure that it ``is reasonable and meets today's
consumer expectations.'' The Secretary also directed FSIS to ``make sure that any policy change does not open the
door to problems like the growth of bacteria that could cause foodborne illness.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is actively pursuing the Secretary's objective to consider both the scientific bases for the policy and the consumer's
expectations and perceptions of the term ``fresh'' as applied to raw poultry. To ensure that consumers, as well as
all other interested parties, have a voice in establishing the Department's ``fresh'' policy, FSIS is holding three
public hearings. These hearings will provide consumers, processors, producers, industry, State and local government
officials, health officials, and all other interested parties the opportunity to present oral and written views
on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has scheduled 1-day public hearings at Modesto, CA; Atlanta, GA; and Washington, DC (see locations and schedules
under

consumer expectations and perceptions of the term ``fresh'' on the labeling of raw poultry. Participants should
be prepared to respond to those issues which are identified below. Participants may comment on other issues relating
to the labeling of poultry as ``fresh'' that have not been identified by FSIS.

The presiding officer at the three hearings will be the FSIS Deputy Administrator for Regulatory Programs. The presiding
officer will be accompanied by a panel of FSIS employees with relevant expertise on the issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who wish to participate are requested to submit a written request to Mr. Charles R. Edwards, Director, Product
Assessment Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Washington, DC 20250. The written request should contain the name, address, telephone number, facsimile number,
affiliation (if applicable) of the participant, location of hearing where participation is requested, and a brief
summary of the presentation. FSIS asks groups that have similar interests to consolidate their comments. FSIS will
allocate the time available for the hearings among the persons who have properly submitted a request for participation.
If time permits, FSIS may allow other interested persons attending the hearings who did not submit a request for participation,
in advance, to make an oral presentation prior to the conclusion of the hearings. FSIS hopes that a broad spectrum of
the private and public sectors will participate in these hearings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS will schedule each appearance after reviewing the notices of participation and accompanying information,
and notify each participant by mail, telephone, or FAX of when the time allotted to the person's oral presentation
is scheduled to begin. Presentations will be limited to 5 to 10 minutes depending on the number of participants. The
hearing schedule will be available at the hearing, and, after the hearing, it will be placed on file with the Docket
Clerk (address above) under Docket Number 94&hyph;022N.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is holding these public hearings to gather information and opinions on the use of the term ``fresh'' as applied
to raw poultry and how it is currently perceived when used on the labeling of raw poultry products. FSIS will use this
information to determine if and how the Department's current policy on ``fresh'' should be changed.

Section 4(b) of the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act requires that a benchmark survey of
U.S. direct investment abroad be conducted covering 1982, 1989, and every fifth year thereafter. These proposed
rules set forth reporting requirements for the survey covering 1994 and replace the rules for the last benchmark survey
covering 1989. The major change in the reporting requirements to be implemented in these proposed rules is the raising
of the exemption level for determining whether a long form or a short form must be filed for nonbank foreign affiliates
of nonbank U.S. parent companies.

The responsibility for conducting benchmark surveys of U.S. direct investment abroad has been delegated by the President
to the Secretary of Commerce, who has redelegated by the President to the Secretary of Commerce, who has redelegated
it to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benchmark surveys are BEA's censuses, intended to cover the universe of U.S. direct investment abroad in value
terms. U.S. direct investment abroad is defined as the ownership or control, directly or indirectly, by one U.S. person
of 10 percent or more of the voting securities of an incorporated foreign business enterprise or an equivalent interest
in an unincorporated foreign business enterprise, including a branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of he benchmark survey is to obtain comprehensive data on the overall operations of U.S. parent companies
and their foreign affiliates, and on positions and transactions between them. The survey is mandated by Congress
to provide a factual framework for addressing the concerns of policymakers and the general public about the effects
of direct investment abroad on the U.S. and foreign economies. The data from the survey are needed to record the size
of U.S. direct investment abroad, measure changes in such investment, and assess its impact. The data will provide
benchmarks for deriving current universe estimates of direct investment from sample data collected in other BEA
surveys in nonbenchmark years. In particular, they will serve as benchmarks for the quarterly direct investment
estimates included in the U.S. international transactions and the national income and product accounts, and for
annual estimates of the U.S. direct investment position abroad and of the operations of U.S. parent companies and
their foreign affiliates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benchmark surveys are the most comprehensive of BEA's surveys in terms of subject matter in order that they obtain
the detailed information on U.S. direct investment abroad needed for policy purposes. As specified in the Act, policy
areas of particular interest include, among other things, trade in both goods and services, employment and employment
compensation, taxes, and technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, the survey will consist of an instruction booklet, a claim for not filing the BE&hyph;10, and the following
report forms:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Form BE&hyph;10A for reporting by a U.S. Reporter that is not a bank;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Form BE&hyph;10A BANK for reporting by a U.S. Reporter that is a bank;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Form BE&hyph;10B(LF) (Long Form) for reporting nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents with assets,
sales, or net income greater than $50 million (positive or negative);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Form BE&hyph;10B(SF) (Short Form) for reporting nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents with assets,
sales, or net income greater than $3 million, but not greater than $50 million (positive or negative); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Form BE&hyph;10B BANK for reporting foreign affiliates that are banks with assets, sales, or net income greater
than $3 million (positive or negative).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the proposed survey is intended to cover the universe of U.S. direct investment abroad, in order to minimize
the reporting burden, foreign affiliates with assets, sales, and net income each to or less than $3 million (Positive
or negative) are exempt from being reported on Form BE&hyph;10B(SF) or BE&hyph;10B BANK (but must be listed on Form
BE&hyph;10A SUPPLEMENT or BE&hyph;10A BANK SUPPLEMENT).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In designing the survey, BEA made substantial efforts to consult with data users outside the Bureau and survey respondents
to obtain their views on the proposed benchmark survey, including the availability and need for the data, the data
items to be reported, and the clarity of instructions.The proposed draft incorporates comments received from users
and respondents. In reaching decisions on what questions to include in the survey, BEA considered the Government's
need for the data, the burden imposed on respondents, the quality of the likely responses (e.g., whether the data are
readily available on respondents' books), and BEA's experience in previous benchmark surveys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major change from the last (1989) survey to the 1994 survey that is reflected in these proposed rules is the raising,
from $15 million to $50 million, of the exemption level for reporting foreign affiliates on the more complex long form.
In the 1994 survey, nonbank foreign affiliates for which assets, sales, or net income is greater than $50 million (positive
or negative) will be required to be reported on Form BE&hyph;10B(LF) (Long Form); nonbank foreign affiliates for
which assets, sales, or net income is greater than $3 million (positive or negative), but for which no one of these items
is greater than $50 million (positive or negative), will be required to be reported on Form BE&hyph;10B(SF) (Short
Form). In the 1989 benchmark survey, the long-form exemption level was $15 million. This proposed change means that
approximately 6,000 foreign affiliates that previously would have been reported on the long form will now be reported
instead on the short form, thus reducing both reporting and editing burden from what it would otherwise have been.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other proposed changes in the survey from 1989 to 1994 include revision of the instructions_primarily for purposes
of clarification_and modification, addition, deletion, or combination of some items on the forms. These changes
do not require changes to the rules.

The General Counsel, Department of Commerce, has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration,
under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), that the proposed rules will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The exemption level is set in terms of the size of a U.S. company's
foreign affiliates. If an affiliate is owned 10 percent or more by the U.S. company and has assets, sales, or net income
greater than $3 million (positive or negative), it must be reported. Usually, the U.S. parent company (the one required
to file the report) is many times larger. Also, to minimize the reporting burden on smaller U.S. businesses, nonbank
foreign affiliates with assets, sales, and net income all below $50 million will be reported on the abbreviated BE&hyph;10B(SF),
or short form, rather than the BE&hyph;10B(LF), or long form.

related functions, including commercial banks, Edge Act corporations engaged in international or foreign banking,
foreign branches and agencies of U.S. banks whether or not they accept deposits abroad, savings and loans, savings
banks, and bank holding companies, i.e., holding companies for which over 50 percent of their total income is from
banks that they hold. If the bank or bank holding company is part of a consolidated business enterprise and the gross
operating revenues from nonbanking activities of this consolidated entity are more than 50 percent of its total revenues,
then the consolidated entity is deemed not

(i) A BE&hyph;10B BANK report must be filed for each foreign bank affiliate of a bank or nonbank U.S. Reporter, whether
directly or indirectly held, for which any one
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the three items_total assets, sales or gross operating revenues excluding sales taxes, or net income after provision
for foreign income taxes_was greater than $3 million (positive or negative) at any time during the affiliate's 1994
fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, a Form BE&hyph;10B BANK must be filed for a foreign bank
affiliate of the U.S. Reporter that owns another 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
nonexempt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 foreign affiliate of that U.S. Reporter, even if the foreign affiliate parent is otherwise exempt, i.e., a Form BE&hyph;10B(LF),
(SF), or BANK must be filed for all affiliates upward in a chain of ownership. However, a Form BE&hyph;10B BANK is not
required to be filed for a foreign bank affiliate in which the U.S. Reporter holds only an indirect ownership interest
of 50 percent or less and that does not own a reportable nonbank foreign affiliate, but the indirectly owned bank affiliate
must be listed on the BE&hyph;10A BANK SUPPLEMENT.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 These proposed regulations will exclude from income and

resources under the supplemental security income (SSI) program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments received by an individual (or spouse) from a fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by a State to aid victims of crime and certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relocation assistance received from a State or local government. These amendments are being proposed in order to
reflect sections 5031 and 5035 of the Social Security Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1612(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Social Security Act (the Act), as amended by sections 5031 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5035 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, effective May 1, 1991, excludes from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income under the SSI program payments received by an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(or spouse) from a fund established by a State to aid victims of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crime, and relocation assistance provided by a State or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government which is comparable to assistance provided under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title II of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. Sections 5031 and 5035 also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended section 1613(a) of the Act to exclude these payments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance from resources for a period of 9 months beginning with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the month following the month in which they are received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, with respect to victims' compensation payments under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 5031, the resource exclusion applies to the extent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the payments were made as compensation for expenses incurred or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses suffered as a result of a crime. In addition, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5031 amended section 1631(a) of the Act to provide that benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title XVI shall not be denied to any individual solely by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason of the refusal of the individual to accept an amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offered as compensation for a crime of which the individual was a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
victim. Section 13732 of Public Law 103&hyph;66 (the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1993) amended section 5035 of Pub. L. 101- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
508 by making permanent the exclusion of relocation assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which originally was set to expire on April 30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations would amend &sect;&sect;416.210(b), 416.1124, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 416.1210 and create new &sect;&sect;416.1229 and 416.1239 to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these statutory changes. These proposed rules would also amend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;416.1161 to apply these same income exclusions when victims' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation payments and State and local government relocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance are received by the ineligible spouse or ineligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parent of an eligible individual or child in order that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deeming rules not reduce the SSI payment of, or render 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ineligible, the individual or child. The proposed amendments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;416.1210 would result in the application of the resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusions to these deemors. Not to apply the exclusions in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases could thwart the Congressional intent underlying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 5031 and 5035 that State victims' compensation payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and relocation assistance not be treated as income and resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and thus not adversely affect SSI eligibility. For this same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason, the proposed resource exclusions would apply to victims' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation payments and relocation assistance received by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alien's sponsor whose resources are deemed to an eligible alien. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 1621(b)(1) of the Act, income exclusions are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable in determining the amount of a sponsor's income that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be deemed to an alien. Therefore, the proposed income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusions for victims' compensation payments and relocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance would not apply to such payments received by a sponsor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose income is deemed to an alien. Section 416.1204 would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
updated to reflect the inclusion of the resource exclusion for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
victims' compensation payments and relocation assistance as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the other resource exclusions applicable to the resources of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponsor.

resources that are excluded from the resources of an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible for SSI benefits. The applicable exclusions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources are explained in &sect;416.1210 (paragraphs (a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through (i), (k), and (m) through (q)) through &sect;416.1239. For

resources excluded by Federal statutes other than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Social Security Act, as applicable to the resources of sponsors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed to aliens, see the appendix to subpart K, Income. We next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocate for the sponsor or for the sponsor and spouse (if living 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together). (The amount of the allocation is the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource limit described in &sect;416.1205 for an eligible individual

Emission Inventory Requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. These revisions are for the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will
be withdrawn, and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this
action should do so at this time.

 This notice announces the availability of two documents entitled, respectively, ``Alternative Formulation of
the Salmon Smolt Survival Index Criteria'', and ``Setting Goals for Salmon Smolt Survival in the Delta''. The first
of these documents presents EPA's proposed alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival index criteria.
The second document is a summary of the 3 scientific workshops held on June 9, 17, and 29, 1994, and prepared by the independent
workshop facilitator. This notice also requests comments on EPA's alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival
index criteria. EPA is not soliciting any additional comments outside the scope of this notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 6, 1994, EPA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a Proposed Rule for water quality standards in the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta
of California (Bay/Delta) (59 FR 810). The purpose of the rule would be to establish certain water quality criteria
for the Bay/Delta as authorized and required by section 303 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The federally-proposed rule
would replace portions of the State of California's water quality standards that were disapproved by EPA on September
3, 1991. Under the proposed regulations, three new sets of criteria would be established: salinity criteria protecting
the Estuarine Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses, a second set of salinity criteria (measured in
electrical conductivity) to protect the Fish Spawning designated use in the lower San Joaquin River, and a set of salmon
smolt survival index criteria to protect the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat designated uses in the estuary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA held public hearings on the Proposed Rule during the weeks of February 21, 1994 and February 28, 1994, and the comment
period closed on March 11, 1994. Subsequent to the close of the comment period, a number of scientific workshops on
the salmon smolt criteria were sponsored and facilitated by a group of water users (including the California Urban
Water Users) and environmental organizations (including the Bay Institute). The purpose of these workshops was
to consider and evaluate both the Proposed Rule and the major comments received by EPA during the comment period. The
workshop sponsors invited EPA to attend the workshops, and EPA staff participated in workshops on June 9, 17, and 29,
1994. The discussions at these workshops are summarized in the August 10, 1994 document entitled ``Setting Goals
for Salmon Smolt Survival in the Delta'' by Wim Kimmerer. After reviewing the oral and written comments and the discussions
at these workshops, EPA has developed a proposed alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival index criteria.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its Proposed Rule, EPA proposed salmon smolt survival index criteria to protect certain of the designated uses.
The survival index quantifies and predicts the survival of salmon migrating through the Delta. These survival indices
are based on models developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and are based in large part on experiments
measuring and comparing smolt survival under a number of different physical conditions of varying migration pathways,
water temperatures, flow rates, and rates of exports from the Delta. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual criteria in the Proposed Rule consisted of target salmon smolt survival index values for the Sacramento
and San Joaquin River systems, varying according to the type of water year (critically dry, dry, below normal, above
normal, and wet). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Success in attaining the target values was to be predicted by using the USFWS models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Alternative Formulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA continues to believe that the USFWS models represent the best available tools to analyze the success of migration
of salmon through the Delta, and provide an adequate scientific basis for establishing water quality criteria that
will protect the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat uses. However, as a result of its review of comments on
the Proposed Rule and its consideration of the discussions at the scientific workshops described above, EPA is proposing
an alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival index criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuous function. The first major conceptual change in the alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival
index criteria is the use of continuous functions to describe the target index values. The proposed rule had different
target values for each of the five water year types. This meant that, for example, all critically dry years would have
the same target index value, even though the hydrological conditions within a critically dry year category could
vary substantially. A ``continuous function'' or ``sliding scale'' approach would recognize this intra-category
variability by providing a target index value that changes simultaneously with changes within underlying hydrological
conditions. For example, the target index value in a ``wet'' critically dry year would be higher than the value for
a ``dry'' critically dry year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received comment on both the proposed estuarine habitat standard and the salmon smolt survival index criteria
to the effect that a continuous function relating the target values to a given condition was more flexible than the
use of five water year categories, while still protecting the designated uses of the waterbodies. Accordingly, the
salmon smolt survival index criteria for both the Sacramento River system and the San Joaquin River system have been
restated as continuous functions. On the Sacramento River system, the target index values have been correlated to
water temperature. On the San Joaquin River system, the target index values have been correlated to unimpaired water
flow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Performance standard. The second major proposed change in the alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival
index criteria is to move away from using the model to predict attainment, and instead to measure attainment of the
criteria using actual experimental data. In the Proposed Rule, the criteria included the actual USFWS models for
the two river systems. Attainment of the criteria would be predicted by evaluating the variables included in the model
itself. That is, the state could attain the criteria only by manipulating the variables contained in the model equations
such that target index values were obtained. Although EPA believes the model contains the substantial majority of
the factors necessary for migrating smolt survival, EPA has restated the criteria to be a true performance standard.
The proposed alternative formulation states an index value as the target criteria (correlated, as indicated above,
to either temperature or unimpaired river flow). Attainment with the criteria, however, would no longer be determined
by manipulating the variables contained in the model, but instead be based on real-time field monitoring to determine
whether a given set of implementation measures have actually attained the target values in the criteria. This reformulation
gives the state maximum latitude to develop implementation measures that attain the target index value. Further,
the reformulation minimizes any statistical deficiencies that may exist in the model by measuring actual measured
success in meeting the target, rather than modeled or predicted success. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the model will continue to be critically important to the standards process, in that it is the best
mechanism for developing and evaluating potential implementation measures. However, by not formally including
the model itself as a part of the criteria, the alternative formulation gives those implementing the standard maximum
latitude to develop implementation approaches that achieve the target index values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More detailed discussion of the conceptual basis for the proposed changes is found in the workshop summary entitled
``Setting Goals for Salmon Smolt Survival in the Delta''. The specific proposed criteria developed by EPA are contained
and described in the document entitled ``Alternative Formulation of the Salmon Smolt Survival Index Criteria.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA desires full public participation in arriving at its final decisions, and therefore solicits comments on all
aspects of this notice from all interested parties. However, EPA requests that comments be limited to the specific
issues raised by the two documents about the salmon smolt survival index criteria. EPA does not intend to respond to
late comments submitted at this time which concern other aspects of the Proposed Rule. Ample opportunity for such
comment was already provided at the public hearings and during the comment period that followed publication of the
Proposed Rule, and EPA is committed to signing a final rule by December 15th, 1994. For those submitting comments,
whenever applicable, full supporting rationale, data, and detailed analysis should be submitted to allow EPA to
make maximum use of the comments.

End Stage Renal Disease Payment Exception Requests

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 1881(b)(2) and (b)(7) of the Act, a facility that furnishes dialysis services to Medicare
patients with end stage renal disease is paid a prospectively determined rate for each dialysis treatment furnished.
This rate is a composite that includes all costs associated with furnishing dialysis services except for the costs
of physician services and certain laboratory tests and drugs, which are billed separately. The composite rate may
be adjusted periodically to reflect actual facility costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a facility incurs higher costs, HCFA may, under certain conditions, grant the facility an exception to its composite
rate and set a higher prospective rate. The facility must show, on the basis of projected cost and utilization trends,
that it will have an allowable cost per treatment higher than its prospective payment rate and that the excess costs
are attributable to one or more specific circumstances. These conditions are specified in existing regulations
at 42 CFR 413.170 and are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 27 of HCFA's Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A facility may incur excess costs when it furnishes dialysis services to a patient population with a greater number
of pediatric patients or sick patients, such as those with heart disease or unstable medical conditions, which require
special equipment, procedures, supplies or staff trained in treating these patients. This is referred to as ``atypical
service intensity'' or ``patient mix.'' A facility may also incur increased costs when it is the only supplier of dialysis
services in its geographical area (an isolated essential facility), and its patients are unable to obtain dialysis
services elsewhere without considerable hardship. Such an isolated facility may find it difficult to find trained
staff, may have to pay employees additional wages or travel allowances, or may have to pay additional costs to have
supplies shipped to the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A facility may also incur excess costs as a result of a fire, earthquake, flood, or other natural disaster (extraordinary
circumstances). However, we do not recognize those costs when a facility did not maintain adequate insurance, did
not file a claim for losses covered by insurance, or did not use its self-insurance program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increased training costs may also be associated with a facility's self-dialysis training program. A facility may
train patients to perform self-dialysis with little or no professional assistance in the facility or at home. It may
also train other individuals to assist patients in performing self-dialysis or home dialysis. A facility that has
training costs greater than its composite training rate may apply for an exception, but must prove that the costs are
reasonable and allowable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Typically, a patient undergoes dialysis three times a week. A facility may furnish a substantial number of treatments
to patients who dialyze less frequently than three times a week. As a result, the facility typically has higher per
treatment cost because the treatments involve increased labor or supplies. When this occurs, a facility may apply
for an exception to the composite rate.

Organ Acquisition Costs

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;412.113, Medicare pays for heart, kidney, and liver acquisition costs incurred by transplant centers
on a reasonable cost basis. Currently, Medicare-certified transplant centers compute Medicare acquisition costs
for hearts and livers on Supplemental Worksheet D&hyph;6 of the Hospital Cost Report (Form HCFA&hyph;2552). The
average acquisition costs of hearts and livers transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries are deducted
from the total acquisition costs for all hearts and livers. Medicare reimburses the remaining balance as program
costs for these organs. Based on recent cost analyses, we are concerned about the very high Medicare costs associated
with acquiring a small number of hearts and livers. As a result, we propose to change the method of computing heart and
liver acquisition costs to more accurately determine the costs of acquiring organs transplanted in Medicare recipients.
The method we propose for computing acquisition costs for hearts and livers conforms to the method used for kidneys
because the kidney formula more fairly accounts for Medicare's portion of such costs, including organ wastage. The
kidney formula is specified in &sect;413.202.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On several occasions, we have denied exception requests based on application of the criteria contained in our PRM,
and the facilities have appealed the denials; subsequently some denials have been overturned by the Provider Reimbursement
Review Board (PRRB) because the PRRB is not bound by the guidelines in the PRM. Therefore, we are proposing to place
in regulations the specific requirements for determining exceptions. We are proposing the conditions contained
in the PRM, with explanations in this preamble, that a facility must meet to qualify for a payment exception and the
criteria that we use to evaluate whether the facility meets the conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to revise 42 CFR Part 413, Subpart H, Payment for ESRD Services. Currently, all our rules for payment for
covered outpatient maintenance dialysis treatments are in &sect;413.170. We propose to reorganize the content
of Subpart H and divide existing &sect;413.170 into several smaller sections so that readers can more easily locate
specific topics.

Section 413.180&blank;Procedures for Requesting Exceptions to Payment Rates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We would redesignate the content of &sect;413.170(f), Procedures for requesting exceptions to payment rates, as
new &sect;413.180. In &sect;413.180(d), we propose to expand this item to provide that a facility must request an
exception to its payment rate within 180 days of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The effective date of its new prospective payment rate(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The effective date that HCFA opens the exceptions process; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An extraordinary cost-increasing event, as described in &sect;413.188. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the 180-day period in which HCFA issues new prospective payment rates or opens the exceptions process,
HCFA counts the effective date as the first day of the 180-day period because payment for ESRD services under the new
composite rates or an approved exception begins that day. An exception request with all required documentation must
be filed with the intermediary by the 180th day. Delivery of the request must be accomplished through a method that
documents the date of receipt during the intermediary's regular business hours. A postmark or other similar mark
does not serve as documentation of the date of receipt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initially, when the ESRD prospective payment rate regulations were promulgated, HCFA intended to annually review
composite rates. However, when HCFA determined that updated rates could not be issued in the near future, it opened
the exceptions process without issuing new rates. This allowed ESRD facilities additional opportunities (other
than when new rates are issued) to file for exceptions to their payment rates. HCFA has opened the exceptions process
twice, permitting facilities that had received partial approvals, new facilities or facilities that had been previously
denied exceptions the chance to file for an exception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;413.180(f), we propose to require that the facility applying for an exception request compare its most recently
completed cost report with those of prior years. Such comparisons may reveal significant changes that may indicate
errors or problems with the cost or statistical data and, thus, the need for HCFA to more intensively review the applicable
area. Any changes to cost or statistical data (for example, treatments) must be explained and the explanation included
with the documentation supporting the exception request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;&sect;413.180(f)(3) and 413.182, we would require that ESRD facilities provide documentation showing
that their excessive costs are specifically or directly attributable to one or more of the exception criteria. As
an example, for an atypical service intensity request, the facility should be able to document the excessive costs
of furnishing care to sicker patients. After submitting evidence that it treats sicker patients, to document higher
labor costs, the facility should submit records to show that either a more experienced and better trained nursing
staff is required to treat these patients, or additional nursing staff time is needed, or both. An example of the type
of records that a provider should submit to document its higher nursing costs could consist of staffing schedules,
indicating staff and patients per shift. The facility could indicate (on the schedules) the sicker patients treated
and the more experienced or additional staff needed to treat them. The monthly staffing schedules should represent
12 months and coincide with the actual cost reporting period of the cost report submitted with the exception request.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a hospital facility, if the direct cost of nursing staff in the dialysis department increased, the administrative
and general (A &amp; G) costs allocated to that department would automatically increase. This is the result of hospital
cost reporting accounting protocol, which requires A &amp; G costs to be allocated on the basis of the accumulated
costs of the other departments. The accounting protocol used for cost reporting is separate and distinct from identifying
the actual A &amp; G costs that are directly attributable to the additional nursing staff costs. Since the total A &amp;
G costs represent costs allocated to the dialysis department, they do not accurately reflect the actual A &amp; G costs
incurred as a result of the additional nursing staff costs. The facility must separately identify the A &amp; G costs
directly attributable to the additional nursing staff costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;413.180(g), we propose to codify in regulations section 1881(b)(7) of the Act by providing that unless HCFA
disapproves a composite rate exception request within 60 working days after it is filed with its intermediary, the
exception is deemed approved. We believe the Congress viewed the 60 days as beginning when we have a fully documented
exception request. Therefore, the first day for counting the 60 working days is the date that the exception request
is filed with all required documentation with the intermediary, not the date it was mailed nor the date postmarked
on the package. For this reason, facilities are advised to send their requests by a method that documents the date of
receipt during the intermediary's regular business hours. We would require that intermediaries review and process
all exception requests within 15 working days, and we would process the exceptions within 45 working days. If we fail
to process a composite rate exception request timely, we would deem the renal facility's rate request approved.

Section 413.182&blank;Criteria for Approval of Exception Requests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to redesignate the content of &sect;413.170(g), criteria for approval of exception requests, as &sect;413.182.
In this section we would list the criteria that may be the basis of a rate exception. These criteria are: Atypical service
intensity (patient mix), as specified in a new &sect;413.184; Isolated essential facility (new &sect;413.186);
Extraordinary circumstances (new &sect;413.188); Self-dialysis training costs (new &sect;413.190); or Frequency
of dialysis (new &sect;413.192). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA occasionally receives one-month time studies from facilities attempting to show that they are entitled to an
exception. HCFA does not require one-month time studies and has not considered a one-month time study as adequate
documentation to justify an exception. In the event that a time study is used, an applicant should refer to the general
Medicare principles regarding the adequacy of periodic time sampling described in chapter 23 of the Provider Reimbursement
Manual (HCFA Publication 15&hyph;1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In new &sect;413.184, paragraph (a) would repeat the content of existing &sect;413.170(g)(1). We would specify
in a new paragraph (b) the documentation required of a facility requesting a rate exception under this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would require that a facility submit a list of all outpatient dialysis patients (including all home patients) treated
during the most recently completed fiscal or calendar year showing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Patients who received transplants, including the date of transplant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Patients awaiting a transplant who are medically able, have given consent, and are on an active transplant
list, and projected transplants; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Home patients; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Infacility patients, staff assisted or self-dialysis; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Individual patient diagnoses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Diabetic patients; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Patients isolated because of a contagious disease; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Age of patients; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Mortality rate broken out by age and diagnosis; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Number of patient transfers, reasons for transfers and any related information; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Total number of hospital admissions for the facility's patients, reason for, and length of stay for, each admission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When adjudicating exception requests, to determine if a substantial proportion of the facility's outpatient maintenance
dialysis treatments involve more intense dialysis services and special dialysis procedures, HCFA will compare
the above data submitted by providers to data contained in HCFA's Patient Profile Tables. The information in the Tables
is developed annually and represents information on persons with end-stage renal disease covered by Medicare. While
the number of treatments is used when determining whether a facility furnishes a substantial proportion of treatments
to atypical patients, it is the typical or the atypical patient mix that generates the total treatment count used in
this determination. In determining whether a facility's patients are atypically sick, each patient category is
individually compared to its corresponding specific norm (national average). Various combinations of factors
might lead to a determination that a facility has an atypical patient mix. For example, a facility might qualify for
an exception for atypical patient mix if the percentage of its diabetic patients, older patients, and mortality rate
were significantly higher than the national averages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By its very nature, an exceptions process addresses situations that are not anticipated, and, because of the myriad
combinations of factors that are possible, we cannot articulate a single specific standard that encompasses all
of these situations. Instead, HCFA will evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis to determine if the characteristics
of the patient population are such that it might be beyond the facility's control to incur higher costs. (Facilities
will still have to demonstrate that the atypical patient mix, in fact, caused higher costs.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would also require that a facility submit the following documentation on nursing personnel (registered nurses
(RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), technicians and aides) costs incurred during the most recently completed
fiscal or calendar year cost report showing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Amount of remuneration of each employee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Number of personnel; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Amount of time spent in the dialysis unit; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Staff to patient ratio based on total hours, with an analysis of productive and nonproductive hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility must demonstrate that its nursing personnel costs have been allocated properly between each mode of
care, and that the additional nursing hours per treatment are not the result of an excess number of employees in the
outpatient maintenance renal dialysis department. Normally, when determining whether there is an excess number
of employees assigned to a facility's dialysis department, HCFA uses staff to patient ratios. However, in addition
to the staff to patient ratios, we might also consider staffing schedules, as previously discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When adjudicating exception requests, HCFA will utilize the above data to determine if the facility's patients received
significantly more nursing hours per treatment than patients would receive in other facilities and whether the facility's
higher per treatment costs were necessitated by the special needs of the patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would also require that a facility submit documentation on supply costs incurred during the most recently completed
fiscal or calendar year cost report showing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;By modality, a complete list of supplies used routinely in a dialysis treatment; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The make and model number of dialyzer and component cost of each dialyzer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility must demonstrate that excess supply cost per treatment is caused by the special needs of the patients
and is not the result of inefficiency. The facility must submit documentation to demonstrate that it prudently purchases
items and services (for example, uses bulk purchase discounts when available).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be considered ``isolated,'' a facility must document that it is located outside an established Metropolitan Statistical

that additional cost per treatment to the exception criteria.

the documentation that we would require of a facility requesting a rate exception under this provision. We would require
that a facility justify its exception request by separately identifying those elements contributing to its costs
in excess of the composite training rate. We consider the facility's total costs, cost finding and apportionment,
including its allocation methodology, to determine if costs are properly reported by treatment modality. Exception
requests for a higher training rate will be granted only with respect to those cost components relating to training
such as technical staff, medical supplies, and the special costs of education (manuals and education material).
Overhead and other indirect costs do not generally form a basis for granting an exception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An ESRD facility may bill Medicare for a dialysis training session only when a patient receives a dialysis treatment
(which normally is three times a week). If an ESRD facility elects to train all its patients using a particular modality
more often than during each dialysis treatment and, as a result, the number of its billable training dialysis sessions
is less than its actual training sessions, the facility may request a composite rate limited to the lesser of the facility's
projected training cost per treatment (CPT) or the CPT the facility would have received in training a patient. For
example, facility x trains patients 5 days a week for a 3-week training period (15 training sessions). Facility Y trains
patients only during a dialysis session, 3 per week, but for a 5-week training period. Both facilities' composite
training rates were determined to be $150 per treatment. Facility X's payment would be adversely affected, since
its payment would be limited to the number of billable training sessions. Facility X's payment would be $1,350 (3 weeks
&times; 3 treatments per week &times; $150) compared to facility Y's $2,250 payment (5 weeks &times; 3 treatments
per week &times; $150). To correct this situation, an exception may be approved (assuming the facility documents
costs) to increase facility X's rate not to exceed $250 per treatment ($2,250 
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
 9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An ESRD facility may bill a maximum per patient of 25 training sessions for hemodialysis training and 15 training sessions
for continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) training.
To ensure adequate patient training, HCFA presumes a minimum number of training sessions per patient in calculating
exception rates, 15 for hemodialysis and 5 for CAPD and CCPD, where the renal facility's actual experience is less
than the minimum number of training sessions. The minimum and maximum numbers are based on HCFA's national data and
general program statistics. These numbers represent the minimum and maximum number of treatments necessary to adequately
train a patient and have been established to avoid paying any additional costs associated with over-training as well
as assuring that quality of care is not jeopardized by not adequately training a patient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a facility trains all its CAPD and CCPD patients in 3 training sessions, and its composite training rate
is determined to be $150. To calculate a facility's training exception rate, the facility's training rate is multiplied
by 15 (the maximum training sessions per patient) and then divided by the facility's actual training sessions, unless
the actual sessions are less than the minimum. Using the facility's actual training sessions, the exception training
rate would be $750 ($150 &times; 15 = $2,250 
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
 3). However, based on using the minimum of 5 training sessions, the approved training rate would be $450 ($150 &times;
15 = $2250

To justify an accelerated training exception request, an ESRD facility must document that all training sessions
provided under a particular modality are to be provided during the shorter but more condensed period. The facility
must submit with the exception request a list of patients, by modality, trained during the most recent cost report
period, and the list must include each beneficiary's name, age, and training status (completed, not completed, being
retrained, or in the process of being trained). The total treatments from the patient list must agree with the total
treatments reported on the cost report filed with the request. We propose to deny exception requests that a facility
submits without the above documentation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We would redesignate paragraph (g)(6) of &sect;413.170 as &sect;413.192 and add the following provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing &sect;412.170(g)(6) specifies that, to qualify for an exception to the prospective payment rate based
on frequency of dialysis, the facility must have a substantial portion of outpatient maintenance dialysis treatments
furnished to patients who dialyze less frequently than three times per week. A facility that furnishes a substantial
portion of outpatient maintenance dialysis services to patients who dialyze less frequently than three times per
week typically has higher costs per treatment because the treatments that are furnished to these patients last longer
and involve higher labor and supply costs. For a facility to qualify as having a substantial portion of outpatient
maintenance dialysis treatments furnished to patients who dialyze less frequently than three times per week, a facility
must be able to document that it has a decrease in treatments in excess of 15 percent, and cost increases due to frequency.
Because the facility is only dialyzing patients twice a week instead of three times, if 100 percent of their patients
dialyze twice a week, the facility would lose 33.3 percent of treatments on an annual basis. HCFA has determined that
15 percent of lost treatments is substantial.

The percentages calculated above, and HCFA's determination of what is substantial is explained below. If a facility
had 200 patients and all the patients dialyzed twice a week, then the facility would be losing 200 billable treatments
a week or 33.3 percent. This calculation is as follows:

We propose to require that, in order to document that it furnishes a substantial number of dialysis treatments at a
frequency less than three times per week, a facility submit the following information. The facility must submit a
list of patients who received outpatient dialysis treatments for the latest historical cost report that is being
filed with the request. The list must indicate_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether the patients are permanent, transient or temporary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The medically prescribed frequency of dialysis; and

&bull;The number of dialysis treatments that each patient received on a weekly and yearly basis and an explanation

The facility must also submit a list of patients used to project treatments. The list must indicate_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether the patients are permanent, transient or temporary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The medically prescribed frequency of dialysis; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The number of dialysis treatments that each patient is projected to receive on a weekly and yearly basis, an

In order for HCFA to determine if the facility meets the 15 percent requirement discussed above, the following information
must be submitted:

We would remove from the definition of ``freestanding'' the requirement that hospital-based OPOs service a single
transplant center. Section 4009(g) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100&hyph;203) required
that OPOs be designated by Medicare to include no more than one OPO per service area. As the certification process limited
only one to an area and some of the OPOs were hospital-based, limiting the OPO's responsibility to a single transplant
center became impractical. An OPO (whether independent or hospital-based) is required to service all transplant
centers in its area. Accordingly, it would be very rare when a hospital-based OPO would service a single transplant
center.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing &sect;413.179 would be redesignated as &sect;413.202 with changes discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Organ Acquisition Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that there is a more reasonable and accurate determination of the Medicare program's share of heart and lung
acquisition costs, we propose to pay transplant hospitals using the same method that we use to determine Medicare's
share of the cost of acquiring kidneys. As noted earlier, organ acquisition costs are paid to Medicare-certified
transplant centers as cost passthroughs (&sect;412.113(d)). The cost of acquiring kidneys for transplant is determined
by using a formula specified in &sect;413.179. Existing &sect;413.179 (redesignated as &sect;413.202 in this proposed
rule) requires that transplant hospitals compute Medicare kidney acquisition costs based on the ratio of the number
of usable kidneys transplanted into Medicare beneficiaries to the total number of usable kidneys applied to reasonable
costs. We propose to expand the applicability of redesignated &sect;413.202 to include hearts and livers by making
it apply to ``organs'' instead of ``kidneys.'' We believe that this revision would result in a more reasonable determination
of Medicare heart and liver acquisition costs because the kidney formula more fairly accounts for Medicare's portion
of such costs, including organ wastage. We would cross refer &sect;412.113 to &sect;413.202 to ensure proper cost
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By making this change, we would ensure that acquisition costs of organs transplanted in non-Medicare recipients
are excluded from Medicare payment. Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act requires that the cost of services be borne by
the appropriate payor. Accordingly, the cost associated with organs not used by Medicare beneficiaries must be borne
by the responsible individual or third party payor. The law precludes Medicare from paying any costs associated with
organs not used by Medicare beneficiaries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consequently, we would require that Medicare-certified transplant centers and organ procurement organizations
(OPOs) separate costs associated with organs transplanted in non-Medicare recipients from Medicare allowable
costs prior to final settlement by the Medicare fiscal intermediary. To separate costs, we would require that the
transplant centers compute the ratio of the number of organs used for Medicare beneficiaries to the total number of
organs used and adjust the costs for organs transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries (proposed
&sect;413.202).

Payment for Erythropoietin (EPO)/Epoietin (EPO) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Erythropoietin (EPO) is an anti-anemia drug given to dialysis patients with a specified level of anemia. Payments
to ESRD facilities are made in increments of 1,000 unit doses, rounded to the nearest 100 units. Section 13566 of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93) decreased the maximum payment for EPO from $11 to $10 per 1,000
units, which is specified in section 1881(b)(11)(B)(ii) of the Act. This amount is subject to adjustment by HCFA,
if necessary. Existing &sect;413.170(c) provides that HCFA publishes annually a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

adjustment to the payment amount is necessary, we publish a

IV. Collection of Information Requirements

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 413.184, 413.186, 413.190, and 413.192 of the regulations contain information collection or recordkeeping
requirements, or both, that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The information collection requirements concern the documentation required
of a facility furnishing dialysis services to patients with end stage renal disease that requests an exception to
the prospective payment rate. The respondents who will provide the information include providers that furnish dialysis
services to patients with end stage renal disease. No new reporting burden will exist as a result of this regulation,
since we propose to place in regulations current documentation requirements already published in Chapter 27 of the
PRM. Therefore, the public reporting burden for this collection of information would be the same as that for Chapter
27, which was approved by OMB on September 21, 1991 for use through September 30, 1994, under control number 0938&hyph;0296.
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection and recordkeeping requirements
should direct them to the OMB official whose name appears in the ``

V. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all hospitals and ESRD facilities are considered
to be small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a
significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Payment Exception Requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this portion of the proposed rule is to codify in regulations existing policy concerning an ESRD facility's
request for an exception to its prospectively determined payment rate. This policy is contained in chapter 27 of the
Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM). This proposed rule would affect all ESRD facilities, including hospital-based
and freestanding, that file for an ESRD exception request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our records indicate that as of December 31, 1990, there were 1,968 facilities eligible to file exception requests.
Of these, 275 or 14 percent of the facilities filed exception requests during the December 1, 1989 to May 29, 1990 exception
period. This resulted in 194 granted requests (mostly partially granted) and 81 denials. During our most recent exception
request cycle, for the period March 1, 1991 through August 27, 1991, 135 facilities filed exception requests. This
resulted in 87 requests being granted at least in part and 48 denials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current procedures, an ESRD facility requesting an exception to its prospective payment rate complies with
the instructions contained in chapter 27 of the PRM. A facility whose request is granted only partially or is denied
an exception may appeal its request to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB). The PRRB is bound by the statute
and regulations and, in interpreting them, may come to a different conclusion than if it followed program instructions.
If we codify in regulations details now found in the PRM instructions, the PRRB would be presented with more specific
bases for adjudicating an appeal of a partially denied or denied exception request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Organ Acquisition Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1992, there were 66 hospitals certified to perform heart transplants and 33 hospitals certified to perform liver
transplants. These amount to less than two percent of all Medicare participating hospitals. In 1991, there were 182
liver transplants and 335 heart transplants performed on Medicare beneficiaries. Although the number of Medicare
transplants represents less than one-fourth of the total number of heart and liver transplants, a preliminary review
of cost report data indicates the average Medicare acquisition cost per liver and per heart is higher than the average
non-Medicare acquisition cost. Most organ procurement costs are incurred before a recipient is identified as a Medicare
beneficiary; thus, we do not believe the Medicare program's share of acquisition costs should exceed the non-Medicare
share. We believe that the current method of cost reimbursement contains the potential for transplant centers to
include some non-Medicare costs in the Medicare costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would extend the formula used to compute kidney acquisition costs to other organs, including hearts
and livers. Acquisition costs would be based on the ratio of the number of usable organs transplanted into Medicare
beneficiaries to the total number of usable organs. It would not affect our obligation to pay allowable organ acquisition
costs, but would prevent Medicare from bearing costs associated with non-Medicare procedures. Based on the number
of Medicare organ transplants, we anticipate annual Medicare program savings associated with this provision of
less than $5 million. Facilities that have been correctly reporting non-Medicare acquisition costs would not be
affected by this proposal. Facilities that have not would find their Medicare payments reduced to better reflect
Medicare's share of allowable acquisition costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we
have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities and would not have a significant economic impact on the operations
of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;413.174

Prospective rates for hospital-based and independent ESRD facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In accordance with section 1881(b)(7) of the Act, HCFA establishes prospective rates using a methodology that_

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Differentiates between hospital-based facilities and independent ESRD facilities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Effectively encourages efficient delivery of dialysis services; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Provides incentives for increasing the use of home dialysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For purposes of rate-setting and payment under this section, HCFA considers any facility that does not meet all
of the criteria of a hospital-based facility to be an independent facility. A determination under this paragraph
is an initial determination under &sect;498.3 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For purposes of rate-setting and payment under this section, HCFA will determine that a facility is hospital-based
if the_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Facility and hospital are subject to the bylaws and operating decisions of a common governing board. This governing
board, which has final administrative responsibility, approves all personnel actions, appoints medical staff,
and carries out similar management functions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Facility's director or administrator is under the supervision of the hospital's chief executive officer and
reports through him or her to the governing board; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Facility personnel policies and practices conform to those of the hospital; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Administrative functions of the facility (for example, records, billing, laundry, housekeeping, and purchasing)
are integrated with those of the hospital; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Facility and hospital are financially integrated, as evidenced by the cost report, which reflects allocation
of overhead to the facility through the required step-down methodology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In determining whether a facility is hospital-based, HCFA does not consider_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An agreement between a facility and a hospital concerning patient referral; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A shared service arrangement between a facility and a hospital; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The physical location of a facility on the premises of a hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If all the physicians furnishing services to patients in an ESRD facility elect the initial method of payment (as
described in &sect;414.313(c) of this subchapter), the prospective rate (as described in paragraph (a) of this section)
paid to that facility is increased by an add-on amount as described in &sect;414.313. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Erythropoietin (EPO)/Epoietin (EPO). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When EPO is furnished to an ESRD patient by a Medicare approved ESRD facility or a supplier of home dialysis equipment
and supplies, payment is based on the amount specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The payment is made only on an assignment basis, that is, directly to the facility or supplier, which must accept,
as payment in full, the amount that HCFA determines.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) HCFA determines the payment amount in accordance with the following rules: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The amount is prospectively determined, as specified in section 1881(b)(11)(B)(ii) of the Act, reviewed and
adjusted by HCFA, if necessary, and paid to hospital-based and independent dialysis facilities and to suppliers
of home dialysis equipment and supplies, regardless of the location of the facility, supplier, or patient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If HCFA determines that an adjustment to the payment amount is necessary, HCFA publishes a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice proposing a revision to the EPO payment amount and requesting public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Any increase in this amount for a year does not exceed the percentage increase (if any) in the implicit price deflator
for gross national product (as published by the Department of Commerce) for the second quarter of the preceding year
over the implicit price deflator for the second quarter of the second preceding year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The Medicare payment amount is subject to the Part B deductible and coinsurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) In addition to the prospective payment described in this section, HCFA makes an additional payment for certain
drugs furnished to ESRD patients by a Medicare-approved ESRD facility. HCFA makes this payment directly to the ESRD

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. The facility must accept the allowance determined by HCFA as payment in full. Payment for these drugs is
made as described below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

payment rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If a facility projects on the basis of prior year cost and utilization trends that it will have an allowable cost
per treatment higher than its prospective rate set under this chapter and if these excess costs are attributable to
one or more of the factors in &sect;413.182, the facility may request that HCFA approve an exception to that rate and
set a higher prospective payment rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) This higher payment rate is subject to the rules governing the amount of payment in &sect;413.176. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A facility must request an exception to its payment rate within 180 days of_

proof is not on HCFA to show that the criteria are not met and that the facility's costs are not allowable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If requesting an exception to its payment rate, a facility must submit to HCFA its most recently completed cost
report as required under &sect;413.198 and whatever statistics, data, and budgetary projections are determined
by HCFA to be needed to adjudicate the exception. HCFA may audit any cost report or other information submitted. The

Payment exception: Self-dialysis training costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) To qualify for an exception to the prospective payment rate based on self-dialysis training costs, the facility
must establish that it incurs per treatment costs for furnishing self-dialysis and home dialysis training that exceed
the facility's payment rate for such training sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To justify its exception request, a facility must_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Separately identify those elements contributing to its costs in excess of the composite training rate; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Demonstrate that its per treatment costs are reasonable and allowable. (c) HCFA considers the facility's total
costs, cost finding and apportionment, including its allocation of costs, to determine if costs are properly reported
by treatment modality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Exception requests for a higher training rate are limited to those cost components relating to training such as
technical staff, medical supplies, and the special costs of education (manuals and education material) and do not
generally include overhead and other indirect costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Documentation: The facility must provide the following information to support its exception request: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A copy of the facility's training program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The number and qualifications of staff at training sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Accelerated training exception:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An ESRD facility may bill Medicare for a dialysis training session only when a patient receives a dialysis treatment
(which normally is three times a week). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If an ESRD facility elects to train all its patients using a particular treatment modality more often than during
each dialysis treatment and, as a result, the number of its billable training dialysis sessions are reduced, the facility
may request a composite rate limited to the lesser of the_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Facility's projected training cost per treatment; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Cost per treatment the facility would have received in training a patient if it had trained patients only during
a dialysis treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An ESRD facility may bill a maximum per patient of 25 training sessions for hemodialysis training and 15 training
sessions for continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)
training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In computing the payment amount under an accelerated training exception, to ensure adequate patient training,
HCFA uses a minimum number of training sessions per patient, (15 for hemodialysis and 5 for CAPD and CCPD) when the facility
actually provides fewer than the minimum number of training sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) To justify an accelerated training exception request, an ESRD facility must document that all training sessions
provided for a particular modality are provided during the shorter but more condensed period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The facility must submit with the exception request a list of patients, by modality, trained during the most recent
cost report period, and the list must include each beneficiary's_

1. In the Budget Act, Congress recognized the novelty of auctions as a licensing method and encouraged us to experiment
with a variety of techniques to ensure that small businesses and those owned by women and minorities have an opportunity
to participate in spectrum-based services. While we believe that measures taken with respect to the regional narrowband
PCS auctions will provide substantial opportunities for designated entities to participate in narrowband PCS,
we seek comment on whether it may be necessary to adopt alternative provisions such as entrepreneurs' blocks or higher
bidding credits to encourage investment in minority- and women-owned businesses in future auctions. As we have learned,
narrowband PCS licenses may be auctioned for large sums of money in the competitive bidding process. It therefore
may be necessary to do more to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in narrowband PCS
than may be necessary in other, less costly spectrum-based services. In our view, we must consider whether these steps
and any others we may adopt are required to fulfill Congress's mandate that designated entities have the opportunity
to participate in the provision of PCS. We believe that the measures we propose today would increase the likelihood
that designated entities will win licenses in the auctions and become strong competitors in the provision of narrowband
PCS service. We also will review the results of the regional auction in making our decision on the rules proposed in
this Further Notice.

2. As we noted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, by instructing the Commission to ensure the opportunity for designated entities to participate in auctions and
spectrum-based services, Congress was well aware of the difficulties these groups encounter in accessing capital.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Indeed, less than two years ago, Congress made specific findings in the Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity
Enhancement Act of 1992, that ``small business concerns, which represent higher degrees of risk in financial markets
than do large businesses, are experiencing increased difficulties in obtaining credit.''
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Because of these problems, Congress resolved to consider carefully legislation and regulations ``to ensure that
small business concerns are not negatively impacted'' and to give priority to passage of ``legislation and regulations
that enhance the viability of small business concerns.''

3. Congress also recognized that these funding problems are even more severe for minority and women-owned businesses,
who face discrimination in the private lending market. For example, Congress explicitly found that businesses owned
by minorities and women have particular difficulties in obtaining capital and that problems encountered by minorities
in this regard are ``extraordinary.''
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 A number of studies also amply support the existence of widespread discrimination against minorities in lending
practices. As we noted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in October, 1992, the year prior to passage of the auction law, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released an important
and highly-publicized study demonstrating that a black or Hispanic applicant in the Boston area is roughly 60 percent
more likely to be denied a mortgage loan than a similarly situated white applicant.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The researchers measured every variable mentioned as important in numerous conversations with lenders, underwriters,
and examiners and found that minority applicants are more likely to be denied mortgages even where they have the same
obligation ratios, credit history, loan to value and property characteristics as white applicants. The lending
discrimination that occurs, the study found, does not involve the application of specific rules, but instead occurs
where discretionary decisions are made. Based on the Boston study, we found that it is reasonable to expect that race
will affect business loans that are based on more subjective criteria to an even greater extent than the mortgage loan
process, which uses more standard rules.

4. Similarly, evidence presented in testimony before the House Minority Enterprise Subcommittee on May 20, 1994
indicates that African American business borrowers have difficulty raising capital mainly because they have less
equity to invest, they receive fewer loan dollars per dollar of equity investment, and they are less likely to have
alternate loan sources, such as affluent family or friends. Assuming two hypothetical college-educated, similarly
situated male entrepreneurs, one black, one white, the testimony indicated that the white candidate would have access
to $1.85 in bank loans for each dollar of owner equity invested, while the black candidate would have access to only
$1.16. According to the testimony, the problems associated with lower incomes and intergenerational wealth, as
well as the discriminatory treatment minorities receive from financial institutions, make it much more likely that
minorities will be shut out of capital intensive industries, such as telecommunications. This testimony also noted
that African American representation in communications is so low that it was not possible to generate meaningful
summary statistics on underrepresentation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that inability to access capital is also a major impediment to the successful participation of women in PCS auctions.
In enacting the Women's Business Ownership Act in 1988, Congress made findings that women, as a group, are subject
to discrimination that adversely affects their ability to raise or secure capital.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 AWRT documents that these discriminatory barriers still exist today. Indeed, AWRT reports that while venture capital
is an important source of funding for telecommunications companies, women-owned companies received only approximately
one percent of the $3 billion invested by institutional venture capitalists in 1993. Citing a 1992 National Women's
Business Council report, AWRT further argues that even successful women-owned companies did not overcome these
financing obstacles after they had reached a level of funding and profitability adequate for most other businesses.

6. A study prepared in 1993 by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO) further illustrates the barriers
faced by women-owned businesses. For example, it finds that women-owned firms are 22 percent more likely to report
problems dealing with their banks than are businesses at large. In addition, the NFWBO study finds that the largest
single type of short-term financing used by women business owners is credit cards and that over half of women-owned
firms use credit cards for such purposes, as compared to 18 percent of all small to medium-sized businesses, which
generally use bank loans and vendor credit for short-term credit needs. With regard to long-term financing, the study
states that a greater proportion of women-owned firms are turning, or are forced to turn, to private sources, and to
a wider variety of sources, to fulfill their needs. Based on these findings, the NFWBO study concludes that removal
of financial barriers would encourage stronger growth among women-owned businesses, resulting in much greater
growth throughout the economy.

7. If we are to meet the congressional goals of promoting economic opportunity and competition by disseminating licenses
among a wide variety of providers, we must find ways to counteract effectively these barriers to entry. As chronicled
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
both Congress and the Commission have tried various methods to enhance access to the broadcast and cable industries
by minorities and women.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 These efforts however, have met with limited success. The record shows that women and minorities have not gained substantial
ownership representation in either the broadcast or non-broadcast telecommunications industries. For example,
a 1993 report conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA) Minority Telecommunications
Development Program shows that, as of August 1993, only 2.7 percent of commercial broadcast stations were owned by
minorities. Another study commissioned by the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency in 1991
found that only one half of one percent of the telecommunications firms in the country were minority owned. The study
also identified only 15 minority cable operators and 11 minority firms engaged in the delivery of cellular, specialized
mobile radio, radio paging or messaging services in the United States.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 And, according to the last available U.S. Census, only 24 percent of the communications firms in the country were owned
by women, and these women-owned firms generated only approximately 8.7 percent of the revenues earned by communications
companies.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 When companies without paid employees are removed from the equation, firms with women owners represent only 14.5
percent of the communications companies in the country.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 One result of these low numbers is that there are very few minority or women-owned businesses that bring experience
or infrastructure to narrowband PCS. They thus face an additional barrier relative to many existing service providers.

commenter asserts that ten large companies_six Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), AirTouch (formerly
owned by Pacific Telesis), McCaw, GTE and Sprint_control nearly 86 percent of the cellular industry. This commenter

9. In the new auction law, Congress directed the Commission to remedy this serious imbalance in the participation
by certain groups, especially minorities and women. The auction law itself contemplates that requiring payment
for initial licenses through competitive bidding, unlike existing licensing methods such as comparative hearings
or lotteries, may inhibit participation by those with limited access to capital and could further diminish opportunities
for designated entities. The first nationwide auction demonstrated that a 25 percent bidding credit may not be sufficient
to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate where narrowband PCS values are high. The
regional auctions will demonstrate whether a 40 percent bidding credit for women- and minority-owned firms combined
with installment payments for eligible small businesses is sufficient to provide meaningful opportunities for
designated entities at the regional level. We further propose to examine the use of measures we specified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to carry out Congress's directive to provide meaningful opportunities for small entities and businesses owned by
women and minorities to provide PCS services. If, based on the results of the regional auction, we conclude that the
40 percent bidding credit is insufficient, we may decide that these measures, which are expressly designed to address
the funding problems faced by these groups, may be necessary to achieve Congress's goals with respect to narrowband
PCS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. While there was significant designated entity participation in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction, we are
concerned that the high license values in that auction and the substantial involvement by large, incumbent firms
with significant financial resources suggests that designated entities may have difficulties in competing in future
narrowband PCS auctions. We recognize that larger incumbent firms are able to pay much higher license prices than
smaller firms because of the significant infrastructure and cost of capital advantages these firms enjoy. Because
of these factors, we believe that additional measures may be necessary to achieve Congress's mandate that we ensure
the opportunity for designated entities to participate in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of
spectrum-based services. In this regard, we propose additional provisions for businesses owned by women and/or
minorities and small businesses similar to those employed in the auction rules for broadband PCS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. To fulfill Congress's mandate that we ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in
providing narrowband PCS; we propose to reserve up to four MTA frequency blocks_19, 21, 22 and 24_, and both BTA frequency
blocks_25 and 26_for bidding exclusively by entities with annual gross revenues of less than $125 million and total
assets of less than $500 million (``entrepreneurs' blocks''). We believe that excluding large companies from bidding
in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks, and limiting the total number of licenses that one entity can obtain in these
blocks, would significantly enhance opportunities for smaller entities to become PCS providers and thereby ensure
that narrowband PCS licenses will be disseminated ``among a wide variety of applicants,'' as required by Section
309(j)(3)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. We recognize, however, that reserving blocks for bidding only by relatively small companies may not, by itself,
be sufficient to ensure that small businesses and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have the
opportunity to obtain narrowband PCS licenses. Businesses owned by members of minority groups and women face discrimination
that poses additional obstacles for these firms. Accordingly, we propose a number of related steps to assist small
businesses and businesses owned by woman and/or minorities in attracting the capital necessary to obtain a narrowband
PCS license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. First, to encourage large companies to invest in designated entities and to assist designated entities without
large investors to overcome the additional hurdle presented by auctions, we propose to make bidding credits available
to designated entities within the entrepreneurs' blocks. More specifically, we propose to provide small businesses
with a 10 percent bidding credit. Businesses owned by minorities and women would receive a 15 percent bidding credit
to compensate for the substantial problems they face in attracting capital.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 The credits would be cumulative, so that a business owned by minorities or women that also qualified as a small business
would receive a 25 percent bidding credit. Second, we propose to allow most successful bidders within the entrepreneurs'
block to pay for their licenses in installments and to ``enhance'' those installment payments for small businesses
and businesses owned by minorities and women by varying the moratorium on principal and the interest rate. Third,
we propose to continue to extend our tax certificate policies to promote participation by minorities and women in
the provision of narrowband PCS. Fourth, we propose to reduce the upfront payment for all eligible bidders in the entrepreneurs'
blocks from $0.02 per MHz per pop to $0.015 per MHz per pop.

Although this bidding credit would be less than the bidding credit available for selected nationwide and regional
licenses (25 percent and 40 percent respectively), the 15 percent bidding credit would be available within the entrepreneurs'
block rather than in a block where all companies could participate.

14. Finally, we propose to redesignate the two BTA licenses as regional licenses organized in the same configuration
set forth in Section 24.102 of the rules. We also seek comment on other means to achieve larger geographic license sizes
such as designating these BTA licenses as nationwide licenses or by maintaining the BTA designation, but allowing
combinatorial bidding for the designated regions. We also seek comment on whether some of the MTA and BTA response
channels should be redesignated as larger license areas with bidding limited only to those entities eligible to bid
for entrepreneurs' block licenses.

18. We also request comment on alternatives intended to deter shams and fronts and to prevent abuse of the incentives
for designated entities. The Commission would enforce vigorously any requirements adopted. These proposals include
a holding and limited transfer period for licensees in the entrepreneurs' blocks and repayment provisions associated
with bidding credits and installment payments. These steps and our eligibility and affiliation rules are intended
to ensure that the benefits of any measures we take flow to the entities Congress intended. Ultimately, we believe
that we will best fulfill our statutory mandate by creating powerful incentives for

would likely produce on the opportunity for designated entities to acquire narrowband PCS licenses.

19. As discussed above, because the auction process itself requires additional expenditures of capital to acquire
licenses, this new licensing procedure in many respects holds the potential to erect an additional barrier to entry
that had not existed even under the Act's previous licensing methods, comparative hearings and lotteries. As reflected
in the House Committee Report, Congress was well aware of that possibility and wanted to ensure that competitive bidding
should not exclude smaller entities from obtaining licenses.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 The inability of small businesses and businesses owned by women and minorities to obtain adequate private financing
creates a serious imbalance between these companies and large businesses in their prospects for competing successfully
in narrowband PCS auctions.

20. We anticipate that the results of the narrowband regional auctions as well as the comments we seek in this Notice
will be relevant to our final conclusion of whether an entrepreneurs' block is appropriate in narrowband PCS. We seek
comments on what results in the regional auction would or would not justify the use of an entrepeneurs' block in subsequent
narrowband auctions. The $125 million gross revenue/$500 million asset caps have the effect of excluding the large
companies that would easily be able to outbid designated entries and frustrate Congress' goal of disseminating licenses
among a diversity of licensees. At the same time, this restriction does not exclude many firms that, while not large
in comparison with other telecommunications companies, nevertheless are likely to have the financial ability to
provide sustained competition for the PCS licensees. For example, the $125 million gross revenue figure corresponds
roughly to the Commission's definition of a Tier 2, or medium-sized, local exchange carrier,
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 and would include virtually all of the independently owned rural telephone companies, while excluding the largest
incumbent paging licensees. Limiting the personal net worth of any individual investor or affiliate of the applicant
to $100 million would prevent a very wealthy individual from leveraging his or her personal assets to allow the applicant
to circumvent the size limitations of the entrepeneurs' blocks.

Local exchange carriers are categorized as Tier 1 and Tier 2 companies by applying the criterion that Sections 32.11(a)
and 32.11(e) of the Commission's Rules use to distinguished Class A and Class B companies, respectively. Class A companies
are those companies having annual revenues from regulated telecommunications operations of $100 million or more;
Class B companies are those companies having annual revenues from regulated telecommunications operations of less
than $100 million. The initial classification of a company is determined by its lowest annual operating revenues
for the five immediately preceding years. A company's classification is changed when its annual operating revenue
exceeds or is under the $100 million mark in each of five consecutive years. The Commission imposes more relaxes regulatory
requirements on Tier 2 LECs than on Tier 1 LECs.

21. In determining which of the blocks in each market should constitute the entrepreneurs' blocks, we seek to make
sufficient opportunity available to businesses that would qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks and to those that
would not. We seek comment on whether it would be appropriate to include all of those remaining blocks designated for
bidding credits and to add one additional MTA block and one additional BTA block if we decide to adopt the proposal.
We seek comment on the choice of blocks and the number of blocks that should be included in the entrepreneurs' blocks.
We want to choose blocks to provide adequate amounts of spectrum and geographic territory necessary to ensure that
the eligible bidders will be able to compete effectively. We believe that designating a variety of frequency blocks
as entrepreneurs' blocks would satisfy the needs of those parties who believe they must have larger amounts of spectrum
to compete effectively as well as the needs of other designated entities who require smaller blocks. Finally, it would
not foreclose opportunities for other parties.

Holding and Limited Transfer Period.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because we interpret the congressional goal of giving designated entities the opportunity to provide spectrum-based
services to extend beyond merely obtaining a license, we seek comment on whether we should prohibit licensees in the
entrepreneurs' blocks from voluntarily assigning or transferring control of their licenses for a period of three
years from the date of the license grant.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 We further ask commenters to address whether, for the next two to seven years of the license term, we should permit the
licensee to assign or transfer control of its authorization only to an entity that satisfies the entrepreneurs' blocks
entry criteria.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 Comments should address whether any restrictions of this type would accurately balance the goal of promoting access
to capital by designated entities with the need to assure the integrity of our process. During this limited transfer
period, licensees would continue to be bound by the financial eligibility requirements, as set forth below.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, a transferee or assignee who receives an entrepreneurs' block license during this period would remain
subject to the transfer restrictions for the balance of the holding period.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Should any of these proposals be adopted, the Commission would conduct random pre- and post-auction audits to ensure
that applicants receiving preferences are in compliance with the FCC's rules.

we note that a transfer is considered ``involuntary'' if it is made pursuant to a court decree requiring the sale or
transfer of the licensee's stock or assets.

23. Our goals are to create significant opportunities for entrepreneurs, small businesses, and businesses owned
by minorities and women to compete in auctions for licenses and attract sufficient capital to build-out those licenses
and provide service. We recognize the critical need to attract capital, which requires flexibility. We are very concerned,
however, that such flexibility not undermine our more fundamental objective, which is to ensure that designated

of meaningful long-term participation by designated entities and how such a rule would impact the ability to raise
capital.

Third Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we adopted a 25 percent bidding credit for businesses owned by minorities and women. We concluded that the use of bidding
credits would be an effective tool to ensure that women and minority-owned businesses have opportunities to participate
in the provision of narrowband services.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 And, in this Order, we raised this bidding credit to 40 percent for the regional narrowband auctions. While we do not
think that a bidding credit of this magnitude is required when used in conjunction with an insulated entrepreneurs'
block, we continue to believe that a bidding credit is necessary to ensure that women and minority-owned businesses
have the opportunity to participate in narrowband PCS. In addition, we believe that a small bidding credit is warranted
to help small businesses overcome financing obstacles. Accordingly, we propose to continue to provide a bidding
credits in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks that would give small businesses a 10 percent credit, women and minority-owned
businesses a 15 percent credit, and small businesses owned by women and minorities an aggregate credit of 25 percent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
presentations to the Commission, many commenters have indicated that, without spectrum set-asides for narrowband
PCS, bidding credits would not be sufficient to assist designated entities in outbidding very large entities who
are likely to bid for licenses in this service. PCSD states, for example, that all of the existing large paging companies
can justify much larger payments for licenses than could an individual entrepreneur, regardless of a bidder's credit.
Therefore, it believes no entrepreneur will win a bid for any PCS market that is desirable to any of the large companies.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 As described above, in order to afford designated entities a realistic opportunity to obtain licenses in the narrowband
PCS service, we propose to exclude very large businesses from bidding for licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks.
These measures would enhance the value of the bidding credits for small businesses and businesses owned by minorities
and women. In this context, we believe that bidding credits can have a significant effect on the ability of small businesses
and businesses owned by women and minorities to participate successfully in auctions for licenses in entrepreneurs'
blocks.

26. As explained above, the capital access problems faced by small firms and women and minority-owned firms make special
provisions like bidding credits appropriate for these designated entities in narrowband PCS.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 In effect, the bidding credit would function as a discount on the bid price a firm would actually have to pay to obtain
a license and, thus, will address directly the financing obstacles encountered by these entities. Moreover, as noted
previously, women and minorities face discrimination in lending and other barriers to entry not encountered by other
firms, including other designated entities. Therefore, as one of the measures designed to counter these increased
capital formation difficulties, we propose to provide them with a slightly higher bidding credit than small businesses.
Thus, women and minorities would receive a 15 percent payment discount that is applied against the amounts they bid
on licenses. Absent such measures targeted specifically to women and minorities, it might be impossible to assure
that these groups achieve any meaningful measure of opportunity for actual participation in the provision of narrowband
PCS. Similarly, it is reasonable to assume that small firms owned by women and minorities suffer the problems endemic
to both groups. Therefore, we propose a cumulative bidding credit of 25 percent for these groups. We believe that these
measures will help women and minorities to attract the capital necessary for obtaining a license and constructing
and operating a narrowband PCS system, consistent with the intent of Congress. We seek comments on these proposals.

27. As discussed below, we have also proposed to modify the definition of a minority and women-owned firm.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 To receive a 10 percent bidding credit, we propose that a small business must satisfy the same gross revenue test adopted
for installment payments. As explained more fully in the small business definition section, we propose that a consortium
consisting entirely of small businesses also be eligible for a 10 percent bidding credit even if the combined gross
revenues of the consortium exceed the small business gross revenues threshold. In addition, we propose that a small
business that is owned by women and minorities must satisfy the definition of a business owned by minorities and women
as well as the small business definition to receive a 25 percent bidding credit. Finally, we propose that a consortium
of small firms owned by women and/or minorities is eligible for a 25 percent bidding credit, provided that each member
of the consortium meets the definition of a small business and a minority and/or women-owned firm.

repayment policies: if, within the original 10-year term, a licensee applies to assign or transfer control of a license
to for example, an entity that is not eligible for as a high a level of bidding credit, then the difference between the
bidding credit obtained by the assigning party and the bidding credit for which the acquiring party would qualify
would have to be paid to the U.S. Treasury as a condition of approval of the transfer. Thus, an assignment of a license
from a small minority-owned firm to a women-owned firm with revenues greater than $40 million would require repayment
of 10 percent of the original bid price (25 percent less 15 percent) to the Treasury. A sale to an entity that would not
qualify for bidding credits would entail full repayment of the original bidding credit as a condition of transfer.
Small businesses also would be bound by the financial eligibility rules during the entire license term as set forth
below. Thus, if after licensing an investor purchases an ``attributable'' interest in the business and, as a result,
the gross revenues of the firm exceed the $40 million small business cap, this repayment provision would apply.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 If such a proposal were to be adopted, we would envision that these repayment provisions apply throughout the original
term of the license to help promote the long-term holding of licenses by those parties receiving bidding credits.
Nevertheless, as in the case of the holding period and transfer restrictions discussed at &para;&para;88&hyph;89
above we seek comment on any effects such rules may have on the ability of designated entities to attract capital. We
therefore ask commenters to address in detail whether this type of restriction would further the goal of increasing
the number of designated entities participating in the provision of narrowband PCS services.

 we concluded that installment payments are an effective means to address the inability of small businesses to obtain
financing and will enable these entities to compete more effectively for the auctioned spectrum. We also determined
that small businesses eligible for installment payments would only be required to pay half of the down payment (10
percent of the winning bid, as opposed to 20 percent) five days after the auction closes, with the remaining 10 percent
payment deferred until five days after grant of the license. Finally, we indicated that installment payments should
be made available to small businesses at an interest rate equal to the rate for U.S. Treasury obligations.

30. In light of the expected substantial capital required to acquire narrowband PCS licenses, we proposed that installment
payments be available to most businesses that obtain narrowband PCS licenses in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks.
By allowing payment in installments, the government would in effect be extending credit to licensees, thus reducing
the amount of private financing needed prior to and after the auction. Such low cost government financing would promote
long-term participation by these businesses, which, because of their smaller size, lack access to sufficient capital
to compete effectively with larger PCS licensees. Under the rules we propose today, installment payments would be
available to smaller entities that do not technically qualify as small businesses for purposes of other measures
we have proposed, such as bidding credits. We believe, however, that, given the significant costs of narrowband PCS
licenses and the likelihood of very large participants in the other blocks, this option would be fully consistent
with the congressional intent in enacting Section 309(j)(4)(A) to avoid a competitive bidding program that has the
effect of favoring incumbent providers of other communications services, with established revenue streams, over
smaller entities.

31. Under the plan we propose here, all licenses that satisfy the gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth
criteria to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks would be allowed to pay in installments for regional and MTA licenses
granted in those blocks. With respect to the BTA licenses in those blocks, however, only businesses owned by women
and minorities and those licensees with less than $75 million in gross revenues would be able to use installment payments.
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 This distinction is based on the expected lower costs to acquire licenses and construct systems in the BTAs. However,
if we adopt our proposal to redesignate BTA licenses as nationwide or regional licenses, we propose extending installment
payments on those blocks to all parties eligible for the entrepreneurs' blocks. Thus, with the exception of companies
owned by women or minorities, which face additional problems accessing capital, we do not think that a firm with gross
revenues exceeding $75 million would require government financing to be competitive for the BTA licenses.

32. The installment payment option would enable qualified businesses to pay their winning bid over time. These businesses
would still make the applicable upfront payment in full before the auction, but would be required to make a post-auction
down payment equaling only ten percent of their winning bids, half of which will be due five business days after the
auction closes. Payment of the other half of the down payment would be deferred until five business days after the license
is granted. In general, the remaining 90 percent of the auction price would be paid in installments with interest charges
to be fixed at the time of licensing at a rate equal to the rate for ten-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 2.5 percent.
Under this general rule, only payments of interest would be due for the first year with principal and interest payments
amortized over the remaining nine years of the license. Timely payment of all installments would be a condition of
the license grant and failure to make such timely payment would be grounds for revocation of the license.

Enhanced Installment Payments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As explained previously, small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women face capital access difficulties
not encountered by other firms and, thus, require special measures to ensure their opportunity to participate in
narrowband PCS. Accordingly, we propose an ``enhanced'' installment payment plan for these entities. Pursuant
to this enhanced installment payment plan, small businesses who win licenses in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks
would be required to pay interest only for the first two years of the license term at the same interest rate as set forth
in the general rule. Businesses owned by women and/or minorities would be able to make interest-only payments for
three years. Interest would accrue at the Treasury note rate without the additional 2.5 percent.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 And finally, businesses that are both small and owned by women and/or minorities would be required to pay only interest
for five years. Interest would accrue at the Treasury note rate.

To be eligible for these ``enhanced'' installment payments, a firm would have to satisfy either of the two alternative
definitions of a woman or minority-owned business, as set forth in &para;&para;44&hyph;54, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

34. These proposed enhanced installment payments are narrowly tailored to the needs of the various designated entities,
as reflected in the record in this proceeding. We believe that varying the moratorium on principal in the early years
of the loan and varying the interest rate based on these needs would allow small businesses and companies owned by women
and/or minorities to bid higher in auctions, thereby increasing their chances for obtaining licenses. In addition,
it would allow them to concentrate their resources on infrastructure build-out and, therefore, it would increase
the likelihood that they become viable narrowband PCS competitors. We request comment on these proposed enhancements
to the installment payment plan.

Unjust Enrichment Applicable to Installment Payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that large businesses do not become the unintended beneficiaries of measures meant for smaller firms, we
propose to retain the unjust enrichment provisions adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
applicable to installment payments. Specifically, if a licensee that was awarded installment payments seeks to
assign or transfer control of its license to an entity not meeting the applicable eligibility standards set out above
during the term of the license, we would require payment of the remaining principal and any interest accrued through
the date of assignment as a condition of the license assignment or transfer.
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, if an entity seeks to assign or transfer control of a license to an entity that does not qualify for as favorable
an installment payment plan, the installment payment plan, if any, for which the acquiring entity qualifies would
become effective immediately upon transfer. Thus, a higher interest rate and earlier payment of principal may begin
to be applied. For example, a transfer of a license in the fourth year after license grant from a small minority-owned
firm to a small non-minority owned firm would require that the firm begin principal payments and the balance would
begin accruing interest at a rate 2.5 percent above the rate that had been in effect. Finally, if an investor subsequently
purchases an ``attributable'' interest in the businesses and, as a result, the gross revenues or total assets of the
business exceed the applicable financial caps, this unjust enrichment provision would also apply.
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 We seek comment on these proposals.

36. As previously indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the upfront payment requirement was designed to ensure that bidders are qualified and serious and to provide the
Commission with a source of funds in the event that it becomes necessary to assess default or bid withdrawal penalties.
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 The upfront payment ensures that bids during the course of the auction are

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and convey information about the value of the underlying licenses. Our standard upfront payment for narrowband PCS
is $0.02 per MHz per pop. As an additional means of enhancing the opportunity of designated entities to participate
in competitive bidding we propose to reduce the required upfront payment for those applicants. As we concluded in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we are concerned that the $0.02 per MHz per pop upfront payment requirement might impose a barrier for smaller entities
wishing to participate in the auctions. Moreover, we note that most bidders in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks
would be entitled to pay for their licenses in installments, which would require a down payment of only five percent
of the winning bid. We are concerned that requiring an upfront payment that may be larger than the down payment that
the winning bidder is required to tender could discourage auction participation.

37. For these reasons, we propose to reduce the upfront payment requirement to $0.015 per MHz per pop for bidders in
the entrepreneurs' blocks. This 25 percent discount should facilitate auction participation by capital-constrained
companies and would permit them to conserve resources for infrastructure development after winning a license. Moreover,
since the upfront payment is still substantial, we believe that insincere bidding would be discouraged and the Commission
would have access to funds if it must collect default or bid withdrawal penalty payments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
38. As noted previously, eligibility to bid in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks would be limited to companies that,
together with their affiliates and investors, had gross revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last two years
and have total assets of less than $500 million at the time their short form applications are filed. In addition, we
propose to prohibit an applicant from bidding in these blocks if any one attributable individual investor or principal
in the applicant has $100 million or greater in personal net worth at the short form application filing date.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
39. For purposes of determining whether an entity qualifies to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, we propose to follow
the control group and attribution rules set forth with regard to eligibility to bid as a small business. In particular,
winning bidders would be required to identify on their long-form applications a control group that controls the applicant,
owns at least 25 percent of the equity, and in the case of a corporation, holds at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
For partnership applicants, we propose that every general partner be considered part of the group. The gross revenues
and total assets of each member of the control group and each member's affiliates would be counted toward the $125 million/$500
million thresholds, regardless of the size of the member's total interest in the applicant. The $100 million personal
net worth limitation would also apply to each member of the control group. We would not consider the gross revenues
or personal net worth of any other investor unless the investor holds 25 percent or more of the outstanding passive
equity in the applicant, which, as defined above, includes as much as fifteen percent of the voting stock in a corporate
applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40. We also propose more relaxed attribution standard with regard to investors in small businesses owned by minorities
and women. Specifically, we would not consider the gross revenues or personal net worth of a single passive investor
in a minority or female-owned small business unless the investor holds in excess of a 49.9 percent passive interest
(which includes as much as fifteen percent of a corporate applicant's voting stock), provided the women or minority
control group maintains at least 50.1 percent of the equity and, in the case of a corporate applicant, at least 50.1
percent of the voting stock. We believe that such revenue attribution would ensure that only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 small businesses are able to take advantage of the special provisions we have proposed, but would allow those businesses
to attract sufficient equity capital to be truly viable contenders in the PCS industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41. In addition, we propose to allow a consortium of small businesses to qualify for any of the measures adopted in this
order applicable to individual small businesses including the ability to bid in the entrepreneurs' block. As used
here, the term ``consortium'' means a conglomerate organization formed as a joint venture among mutually-independent
business firms, each of which individually satisfies the definition of a small business.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
42. We explain how these attribution rules would apply with regard to any holding and limited transfer period for entrepreneurs'
block licensees should such rules ultimately be adopted. During this holding period, an entrepreneurs' block licensee
could not sell more than 25 percent of its passive equity to a single investor if the resulting attribution of that investor's
gross revenues or total assets would bring the company over the $125 million gross revenues/$500 million personal
net worth cap. Similarly, while individual members of the control group could change (if it would not result in a transfer
of control of the company), the control group would have to maintain control and at least 25 percent of the equity and
50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 A company would be permitted to grow beyond these gross revenues/total assets caps, however, through equity investment
by non-attributable (i.e. passive) investors, debt financing, revenue from operations, business development
or expanded service.

and in this Order have relaxed the attribution standard used to determine eligibility as a qualified small business.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have adopted relaxed attribution standards for businesses owned by women and minorities for purposes of qualifying
for small business provisions. We are proposing relaxed standards for businesses owned by women and minorities to
qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we found generally that to establish ownership by minorities and women, a strict eligibility standard should be adopted
that required minorities or women to have at least 50.1 percent equity stake and a 50.1 percent controlling interest
in the designated entity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para; 68; 47 CFR &sect;1.2110(b)(2). For future narrowband PCS auctions, we propose to retain the requirement
that minorities and/or women control the applicant and hold at least 50.1 percent of a corporate applicant's voting
stock. However, to establish their eligibility for certain benefits, summarized below, we propose an additional
requirement that, even where minorities and women hold at least 50.1 percent of the applicant's equity, other investors
in the applicant may own only passive interests, which, for corporate applicants, is defined to include as much as
fifteen percent of the voting stock. In addition, provided that certain restrictions are met, we propose to allow
women and minority-owned firms the option to reduce to 25 percent the 50.1 percent minimum equity amount that must
be held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46. We emphasized in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that we did not intend to restrict the use of various equity financing mechanisms and incentives to attract financing,
provided that the minority and women principals continued to own 50.1 percent of the equity, calculated on a full-diluted
basis, and that their equity interest entitled them to a substantial stake in the profits and liquidation value of
the venture relative to the non-controlling principals. We noted, however, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that different standards that meet the same objectives may be appropriate in other contexts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para; 278. In view of the evidence of discriminatory lending experiences faced by minority and women entrepreneurs
and the exceptionally great financial resources believed to be required by narrowband PCS applicants, we conclude
that it may be appropriate to allow more flexibility with regard to the 50.1 percent equity requirements for this service
in order to open doors to more sources of equity financing for women and minority-owned firms.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
47. We propose therefore to allow women and minority-owned firms the following options. First, they may satisfy the
general definition set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which requires the minority and/or female principals to control the applicant, own at least 50.1 percent of its equity
and, in the case of corporate applicants, hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock. Under this option, other investors
may own as much as a 49.9 percent passive equity interest. As noted above regarding eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs'
blocks, passive equity in the corporate context means only non-voting stock may be held, or stock that includes no
more than fifteen percent of the voting interests.
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 For partnerships, the term means limited partnership interests that do not have the power to exercise control of the
entity. We ask commenters specifically to address whether the proposed fifteen percent voting interest limitation
strikes the correct balance, or whether a higher percentage would facilitate capital formation without unduly contributing
to a proliferation of shams. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, all investor interests would be calculated on a fully-diluted basis, meaning that agreements such as stock options,
warrants and convertible debentures generally would be considered to have a present effect and would be treated as
if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 We recognize that the requirement that other investors own only passive interests would be a departure from the definition
of a minority or women-owned business adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, but because of the very significant financial contribution that may be made by such other investors in designated
entities, we believe that the passive equity requirement may be appropriate as an additional safeguard. In addition,
we seek comments on whether these rules as currently framed may affect the ability of legitimate designated entities
to obtain the capital needed to participate in the auction.

For example, under this option, a corporate applicant with two classes of issued and outstanding stock, 100 shares
of voting stock and 100 shares of non-voting stock, could sell to a single non-eligible entity 49.9 percent of the applicant's
equity, consisting of 5 shares of the corporation's voting stock and 94 shares of its non-voting stock. Under this
scenario, eligible minorities or women, in order to retain at least 50.1 percent of the value of all outstanding shares
of the corporation's stock, must own all of the corporation's remaining shares of stock; that is, 95 shares of voting
stock and six shares of non-voting stock.

As also noted in the Second Report and Order, we will consider departing from the requirement that the equity of investors
in minority and women-owned businesses must be calculated on a fully-diluted basis only upon a demonstration, in
individual cases, that options or conversion rights held by non-controlling principals will not deprive the minority
and women principals of a substantial financial stake in the venture or impair their rights to control the designated
entity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
48. As a second proposed option, women and minority-owned firms would be able to sell up to 75 percent of the company's
equity, provided that no single investor may hold 25 percent or more of the firm's passive equity, which is defined
in the same manner as above. For example, a corporation with 100 shares of voting stock and 100 shares of non-voting
stock, with the 200 shares representing the total outstanding shares of the company, could qualify as a minority or
women-owned business under the following circumstances. The minority or women principals would have to own at least
51 shares of voting stock, which satisfies the requirement that they have voting control and, in this case, also meets
the requirement that they hold at least 25 percent of the equity. Two other investors could each own 34 shares of non-voting
stock and fifteen shares of voting stock, which represents 24.5 percent of the company's equity for each of the shareholders.
A third investor could own the remaining 32 shares of non-voting stock and fifteen shares of the voting stock, or 23.5
percent of the equity. The remaining 4 shares of voting stock may be sold to other investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49. Whichever option is chosen, we would require establishment of a ``control group'' for women and minority-owned
firms in much the same way we did for purposes of eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Specifically, winning
bidders, transferees or assignees would have to identify on their long-form applications a control group (consisting
entirely of minorities and/or women or entities 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and women) that has

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control of the applicant and holds either at least 50.1 or 25 percent of the applicant's equity, depending upon which
option is elected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50. We believe that a modification of our 50.1 percent equity requirement would best achieve the Congressional objective
of providing effective and long-term economic opportunities for women and minority-owned firms in narrowband PCS.
At the same time, we propose to maintain strict enforcement of the requirement that actual control reside with the
qualified designated entities. Thus, to establish their eligibility for tax certificates, enhanced installment
payments, bidding credits and relaxed cellular attribution rules, women and minority-owned applicants electing
to use the 25 percent equity option could not in any instance allow an individual investor who is not in the control group
to own more than a 25 percent passive equity interest. This restriction would apply even in circumstances in which
allowing an investor to exceed these limitations would not result in the applicant's exceeding the gross revenues
and other financial standards that apply to other bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks and other situations involving
financial caps. These structural safeguards, as well as the general requirement that other investors hold only passive
interests in women and minority-owned applicants, would help to ensure that control truly remains with the women
and minority designated entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
51. For example, a women or minority-owned firm electing to use the 25 percent option may have a non-eligible investor
with more than 25 percent passive stake and still qualify to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks or for benefits that apply
to small businesses, as long as the attributable revenues of the investor do not cause the applicant to exceed the gross
revenues/total asset caps. In these contexts, no additional restrictions would be necessary, because women and
minority-owned applicants, like other applicants, would be eligible to bid in these blocks and to qualify as small
businesses so long as they comply with the same restrictions on financial eligibility that apply to other applicants.
Since the attribution rule itself operates to ensure compliance with size limitations, it would not be necessary
to impose additional restrictions on the size of interests held by investors with attributable interests. This firm
would not qualify, however, for special measures applicable only to women and minority-owned businesses, such as
``enhanced'' installment payments or the 15 or 25 percent bidding credits, because it has a single non-eligible investor
with more than 25 percent passive interest. In circumstances in which women and minorities are required to retain
only 25 percent of the firm's equity, this additional structural restriction would be appropriate because the objective
in this context is to ensure not merely financial eligibility, but that women and minorities retain control of the
license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
52. We set forth previously rules defining more explicitly the term ``control'' for purposes of determining whether
a ``control group'' maintains

 control of an applicant.
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 We propose to apply those rules equally to the minority and women principals of minority and women-owned applicants.
Consistent with our general policies with regard to women-owned applicants for purposes of our multiple ownership
and cross-ownership rules in this broadcast context, we do not propose to adopt, at this time, any special rules or
presumptions to determine whether women-owned applicants exercise independent control of their firms.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Third Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that bars publicly traded companies from qualifying as minority and women-owned businesses for purposes of participating
in auctions. Most of the steps proposed to assist these designated entities in this Further Notice (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, bidding credits and installment payments) are confined to winning bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks, where
there would be a financial limit on the size of participants. Because of the large capital entry costs of narrowband
PCS, we now believe that even publicly traded companies owned by women and minorities that qualify to bid in entrepreneurs'
blocks require additional measures, such as bidding credits and installment payments, to be able to participate
successfully.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
54. As noted above, we propose that applicants owned by women and minorities must meet the limitations on gross revenues,
total assets and personal net worth to qualify for entry into the entrepreneurs' blocks. The size limitations would
not apply, however, to all measures designed to assist applicants owned by minorities and/or women. The tax certificate
policy applies to all narrowhead PCS licenses and would not be limited to licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Therefore,
businesses owned by minorities and women need not meet the gross revenue and other financial restrictions to qualify
for tax certificates. But minority and women-owned firms would have to satisfy the Commission's structural ownership
requirements to receive the benefits of tax certificates; that is, they would be subject to the limitation that interests
held by investors who are not women and minorities must be passive.

I. Limit on Licenses Awarded in Entrepreneurs' Blocks
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
56. The special provisions which we propose for designated entities are based, in part, on our mandate to fulfill the
congressional goal that we disseminate licenses among a wide variety of applicants. 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(3)(B).
Therefore, in proposing the financial assistance measures set forth in this Further Notice, we are concerned about
the possibility, even if remote, that a few bidders will win a very large number of the licenses in the entrepreneurs'
blocks. As a consequence, the benefits that Congress intended for designated entities would be enjoyed, in disproportionate
measure, by only a few individuals or entities. Congress, in our view, did not intend that result. We therefore propose
steps to ensure that the financial assistance provided through our rules is dispersed to a reasonable number of applicants
who win licenses in these blocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
57. To achieve a fair distribution of the benefits intended by Congress, we propose a limit on the total number of licenses
within the entrepreneurs' blocks that a single entity could win at auction. In setting this limit, we would avoid imposing
a restriction that would prevent applicants from obtaining a sufficient number of licenses to create large and efficient
nationwide or regional services. Specifically, we propose a limitation that no single entity may win more than 10
percent of the licenses available in the entrepreneurs' blocks. These licenses could be in any combination of frequency
blocks. Such a limit would ensure that at least 10 winning bidders enjoy the benefits of the entrepreneurs' blocks.
At the same time, it would allow bidders to effectuate aggregation strategies that include large numbers of licenses
and extensive geographic coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
58. Further, this limitation would apply only to the total number of licenses that may be won at auctions in these proposed
entrepreneurs' blocks; it would not be an ownership cap that applies to licenses that might be obtained after the auctions.
For purposes of implementing this restriction, we would consider licenses to be won by the same entity if an applicant
(or other entity) that controls, or has the power to control licenses won at the auction, controls or has the power to
control another license won at the auction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
59. Finally, we are concerned that there are companies that would be eligible for an entrepreneurs' block license
that may desire larger license areas than MTAs and BTAs. It appears that over half of the bidders in the nationwide auction
would have qualified for an entrepreneurs' block license. As a result, we propose to redesignate the two BTA licenses
as regional licenses organized in the same configuration set forth in section 24.102 of the rules. Doing so would give
designated entities an opportunity to bid on a larger and more valuable license under the rules for entrepreneurs'
blocks. We also seek comment on other means to achieve larger geographic license sizes such as designating these BTA
licenses as nationwide licenses or by maintaining the BTA designation, but allowing combinatorial bidding for the
designated regions. Commenters should also address the appropriate premium we should adopt for comparison of combinatorial
and BTA license bids if we allow combinatorial bidding. We also seek comment on whether some of the MTA and BTA response
channels should be redesignated as larger license areas with bidding limited only to those entities eligible to bid
for entrepreneurs' block licenses.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Typical, in the Corps of Engineers, the VEQ clause is used in contracts for dredging or construction excavation. When
the VEQ clause is used, the Government estimates the quantity of units of work to be performed, and the solicitation
and contract provide a unit price for the work. The clause provides that, if the actual quantity is between 85 percent
and 115 percent of the original estimated quantity, the original contract unit price will be paid by the Government
to the contractor, but, if the actual quantity is below 85 percent or above 115 percent, the unit price may be revised
for the underrun or overrun quantity only, but not for the quantities within the 85&hyph;115 percent range of the estimated
quantity. The clause states that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``The equitable adjustment shall be based upon any increase or decrease in costs due solely to the variation above
115 percent or below 85 percent of the estimated quantity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* (Emphasis added.) Because the FAR VEQ clause limits unit price adjustment so those ``due solely
to'' the variations in costs, it freezes the results of a ``bad bargain'' for the Government or the contractor in computing
a unit price for increased work above 115 percent of the estimated quantity. The revised EFARS clause proposed by the
Corps provides for repricing based on the contractor's profit or loss position as well as changes in costs. This will
compensate the contractor fairly, but eliminate windfalls for either the contractor or the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Corps of Engineers is interested in receiving comments on the following issues:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should contracting officers have discretion to use figures different from 85 percent and 115 percent?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should the use of this clause (and its repricing mechanism) be limited to ``major'' work items under the contract?
How would a major work item be defined?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Should implementing guidance make it clear that issuance of a request for repricing by the contracting officer
is a discretionary decision to be issued only when it is expected that the reduction in contract price will exceed the
administrative cost involved or is otherwise in the Government's interest?

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Regulatory Analysis is not required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;611). The proposed change
would not impose a new burden on any small businesses. It is estimated that the revised method would increase the price
paid to a contractor about half the time and decrease the price paid to the contractor about half the time and that the
instances when the clauses would allow reporting the work above 115 percent or below 85 percent would be few.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C., Ch. 35) do not apply. This deviation would not impose a new
requirement on ten or more offerors or contractors to submit, maintain, retain or disclose information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts for fixed-price construction contracts when subdivided
items are to be separately priced for payment purpose.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Variation in Estimated Quantity (Deviation) (XXX 1994)_EFARS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If the quantity of a unit-priced item in this contract is an estimated quantity and the actual quantity is at least
85 percent but not more than 115 percent of the estimated quantity, payment for the actual quantity shall be made at
the contract unit price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the actual quantity of a unit-priced quantity varies more than 15 percent above or below the original estimated
quantity:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Either party may request an equitable adjustment in the contract price as set forth in (2) and (3) below. The party
requesting the equitable adjustment must establish the basis for the equitable adjustment; if no basis is established,
payment for actual quantity shall be made at the original contract unit price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the actual quantity exceeds 115 percent, payment for 115 percent shall be made at the original contract unit
price, and an equitable adjustment may be made in the unit price for the quantity above 115 percent. The equitable adjustment
in the unit price for the balance of the actual quantity above 115 percent shall be based on the reasonable costs for
that part of the work. Such reasonable costs may include reasonable various costs and a reasonable profit; additional
fixed costs may be included, if incurred and reasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the actual quantity is less than 85 percent of the original estimated quantity, payment for the actual quantity
shall be made at the original contract unit price, and an equitable adjustment may be made to compensate the contractor
for incurred reasonable fixed costs that would otherwise be unrecovered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If a quantity variation causes an increase in the time necessary for completion, the Contractor may request in
writing an extension of time. The written request must be received by the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the
beginning of the delay, or with such further period as may be granted by the Contracting Officer before the date of final
settlement of the contract. Upon receipt of the written request, the Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts
and make an adjustment for extending the completion date as, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, is justified.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to petitions submitted by Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety and the American Automobile Manufacturers
Association, this notice extends the comment period for a proposal to require manufacturers of passenger cars, light
multipurpose passenger vehicles, and light trucks to provide consumers with information on the resistance of those
vehicles to rollover. NHTSA believes that commenters need more time to formulate their responses because of the complexity
of the issues in the NPRM. Moreover, to the extent that persons commenting on a series of public meetings on consumer
safety information issues discuss rollover resistance information, preparation of those comments and the comments
on the proposal will be facilitated by specifying the same comment closing date for both. Accordingly, the agency
has decided to extend the comment period from August 29, 1994 to October 21, 1994, the current comment closing date
on the public meeting issues.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 28, 1994, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 that would require vehicle manufacturers to provide consumers with information on the vehicle's resistance to rollover,
in the form of a label that would be affixed to the vehicle and information in the owner's manual (59 FR 33254). The notice
contained an analysis of methods for objectively measuring vehicle stability. It also referenced an extensive discussion
of rollover statistics in an ``Addendum to Technical Assessment Paper'' that was placed in the docket. In addition
to proposing methods to be used to generate the information on the label, the NPRM requested comments on the size, location,
permanence, and content of the information label. The notice requested comments on the proposed regulation and specified
a comment due date of August 29, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 26, 1994, NHTSA published a notice (59 FR 38025) announcing a series of four public meetings on the general subject
of vehicle safety information for consumers. The agency is seeking comment at those meetings on what kinds of safety
information would be useful to consumers and how that information should be presented. The last of the public meetings
will be held on October 6, 1994. The comment due date for public comments on the issues raised at those meetings is October
21, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) submitted a petition dated August 4, 1994, asking that the comments
period for the NPRM be extended to October 21. Advocates requested the extension primarily because it believes that
the public meetings are ``substantively connected'' to the rollover rulemaking. Advocates believes that the commenters
on the June 28 NPRM should have the benefit of the statements presented at each of the public meetings. It suggested
that the agency will receive better submissions from commenters who desire to file comments in both dockets. In addition,
Advocates requested the extension because it needs additional time to resolve the ``highly technical'' issues raised
by the use of engineering metrics for generating consumer information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA) submitted a petition dated August 9, 1994, also asking
the agency to extend the comment period for the NPRM. The AAMA requested the extension because it believes that the
NPRM and other available agency information are insufficient to permit a meaningful analysis of the proposal. The
AAMA requested additional information and an extension of the comment period to the date 60 days after the information
is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the petitions, NHTSA agrees with the petitioners that extending the comment closing date is desirable,
given the complexity of the issues underlying the NPRM. NHTSA also accepts Advocates' reasoning that the public meeting
may generate issues and information that would aid the public in preparing comments on this rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above considerations, the agency believes that there is good cause to extend the comment period an additional
53 days and that this decision is consistent with the public interest. Accordingly, the agency has decided to extend
the comment period until October 21, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the agency wants to stress that persons commenting about issues raised at the public meetings should not
focus on the limited issue of how to present rollover information. Instead, they should address the larger issues
of what additional safety information NHTSA can provide to the public and how NHTSA can better present consumer information
from all the agency's safety activities. Comments focusing on rollover information should be addressed to the docket
for this rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that it is unnecessary to grant a further extension in response to AAMA's petition. The extension to
October 21 should provide sufficient additional time to complete analysis of even the complex issues presented in
the NPRM. The additional information that the AAMA sought in its petition is, and has always been, publicly available,
either by careful reading of the documents in Docket 91&hyph;68, Notices 1 and 3, or through direct correspondence
with the NHTSA personnel who conducted the statistical analyses. Further, much of this information is comparatively
minor and does not significantly affect commenters' ability to conduct analysis or prepare meaningful comments
on the agency's proposal.

The Alexander Archipelago wolf occurs in insular and mainland southeast Alaska, from Dixon Entrance (U.S./Canada
border) to Yakutat Bay, including all large islands of the Alexander Archipelago except Admiralty, Baranof, and
Chichagof Islands. The subspecies may be threatened by elimination of habitat, reduction in prey availability due
to the harvest of older forests, and disturbance due to increased opportunities for public access on expanded logging
road networks.

) to the List of Threatened and Endangered Species (List) and to add a southern Rocky Mountain population to the List
via an emergency listing. The Service finds the petition presents substantial information indicating the requested
action for the contiguous population may be warranted, but there is not substantial information to indicate that
an emergency listing of a southern Rocky Mountain population may be warranted. As a result of a previous court settlement,
a formal status review is underway.

substantial scientific or commercial information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted. This
finding is to be based on all information available to the Service at the time the finding is made. To the maximum extent

A petition dated April 23, 1994, was received by the Service from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation, Evan Frost, Mark
Skatrud, Craig Coonrad, and Michael J. Polly on April 27, 1994. The petition requested that the conterminous United
States population of the ``North American'' lynx (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Felis lynx canadensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) be listed as a threatened or endangered species. Additionally, the petitioners requested that the southern Rocky
Mountain population of the ``North American'' lynx in Wyoming and Colorado be emergency listed.

This species is now recognized as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lynx lynx canadensis (Jones et al. 1992) and is often referred to as the Canada lynx. The Service accepts both of these
names.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners assert that the Canada lynx population in the contiguous United States should be added to the List
of Threatened and Endangered Species because of the following factors: 1. Intensive logging that eliminates foraging
and denning habitat for Canada lynx and snowshoe hare until the vegetation has regrown sufficiently, creates openings
in the forest that Canada lynx avoid, and causes habitat fragmentation that creates barriers to dispersal and colonization;
2. Logging roads allow human accessibility that may increase incidental trapping of Canada lynx and disrupt Canada
lynx travel and hunting; 3. Forest fire suppression adversely affects Canada lynx through the reduction of hare habitat;
4. Few comprehensive management plans for Canada lynx have been developed or implemented by government agencies;
5. State agencies have not adequately modified their furbearer regulations; 6. The Canada lynx's inherent characteristics,
including naturally low population densities, specialized prey requirements, and large home ranges, make it vulnerable
to extinction; and 7. The southern Rockies population is further threatened by ski area developments that may reduce
habitat and prey base and increase human disturbance and accidental trapping. The petitioners requested that the
southern Rocky Mountain population of the lynx be protected by emergency listing because it is severally imperiled,
the population level is low, and it is reproductively isolated.

Listing Factors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The following are the five listing criteria as set forth in section 4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations (50 CFR Part 424)
promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act and their applicability to the current status of the Canada
lynx.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The suppression of forest fires and intensive logging prescriptions have had a detrimental effect on Canada lynx
habitat, and logging roads have increased human accessibility to the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Past overharvest has had a detrimental effect on Canada lynx populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
C. Disease or Predation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canada lynx may be displaced or eliminated when competitors, such as the bobcat (Lynx rufus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or coyote (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis latrans
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), expand into the range of the Canada lynx.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States managed the Canada lynx as a furbearer in the past, but as a result of declining Canada lynx populations, Canada
lynx are classified as threatened or endangered in Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, Vermont, Washington, and
Wisconsin. It is also fully protected from harvest in Maine, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.
Only Idaho and Montana currently allow the harvest of Canada lynx. The above States either prohibit or control the
``take'' of Canada Lynx, but their laws are relative ineffective in controlling the loss or modification of the species'
habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Human development has had a determinental effect on the Canada lynx habitat and population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service may issue an emergency rule when there is an emergency posing a significant risk to the well-being of a species.
Although the Canada lynx population in the southern Rockies may be small, the Service is not aware of any actions that
immediately threaten the population. The petition did not present substantial information to indicate that emergency
listing is warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After finding that a 1991 petition to list the North Cascades population of the Canada lynx as endangered was not warranted,
the Service concluded that a rangewide status review of the Canada lynx should be conducted (58 FR 36924). As a result
of a court settlement in November 1993, the Service is now in the process of formally reviewing the status of the contiguous
United States population of the Canada lynx to determine whether it should be added to the List of Threatened and Endangered
Species. On February 2, 1994, the Service published a notice (50 FR 4887) announcing a continuation of the status review
initiated in 1982. The findings from this review, which must be published by the court appointed date of November 15,
1994, will constitute the 12-month finding for this petition. Considering the language agreed to by the Service in
the court settlement, information provided by the petitioners, and the fact that the Canada lynx is a category 2 candidate
species, the Service finds that there is substantial information to indicate that listing the contiguous population
of the Canada lynx may be warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Services' 90-day administrative finding contains more detailed information regarding the above decisions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents
substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. To the
maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding
is to be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the finding is positive, the Service must promptly commence a review of the status of the species involved and disclose
its findings within 12 months (12-month finding).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 21, 1991, the Service published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 58804) a notice of review for an updated list of animal taxa that are being considered for possible addition to
the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. Among the species included as a Category 2 candidate species was the
northern goshawk (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accipiter gentilis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). By inclusion as a subspecies, the Queen Charlotte goshawk (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accipiter gentilis laingi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was also designated a Category 2 candidate species at that time. Through the publication of that notice, the Service
announced the possible vulnerability of the Queen Charlotte goshawk, initiated a review of subspecies' status,
and requested additional pertinent information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 9, 1994, a petition dated May 2, 1994, was received by the Service from Mr. Peter Galvin of the Greater Gila Biodiversity
Project, Silver City, New Mexico, and nine copetitioners, including the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity,
the Biodiversity Legal Foundation, Greater Ecosystem Alliance, Save the West, Save America's Forests, Native Forest
Network, Native Forest Council, Eric Holle, and Don Muller.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners request that the Queen Charlotte goshawk be listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act
(16 U.S.C. 1533(a)(1)) because of the following factors:

3. Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms to protect preferred habitat from clearcut logging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has reviewed the petition, literature cited in the petition, and other references available in the Service's
files, and contacted persons knowledgeable about this subspecies. On the basis of the best scientific and commercial
information available, the Service finds the petition presents substantial information that listing the Queen
Charlotte goshawk may be warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of an ongoing status review, the Service will further evaluate the current status of the Queen Charlotte goshawk
and determine if listing is warranted for either the entire subspecies or certain distinct population segments of
the subspecies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service would appreciate any additional data, comments, and suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental
agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other parties concerning the status of the Queen Charlotte
goshawk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following issues are of particular interest to the Service: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The genetic, morphologic, and ecological differences, including variations of intergradation of the Queen Charlotte
goshawk within it's currently described range, and from adjacent goshawk subspecies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The range of geographic distribution of goshawks exhibiting the described characteristics of the Queen Charlotte
goshawk subspecies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Additional historic and current population data which may assist in determining population trends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The extent and effects of long-term habitat conversion and fragmentation of mature forest habitat on Queen Charlotte
goshawks and their prey.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 30, 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 determining the coastal California gnatcatcher to be a threatened species (58 FR 16741). In its decision to the list
the gnatcatcher, the Service relied, in part, on taxonomic studies conducted by Dr. Jonathan Atwood of the Manomet
Bird Observatory, Manomet, Massachusetts. As is the standard practice in the scientific community, the Service
did not request, nor was it offered, the data collected and used by Dr. Atwood in reaching his conclusions. Instead,
the Service depended upon the conclusions published by Dr. Atwood in a peer-reviewed scientific article on the subspecific
taxonomy of the California gnatcatcher (Atwood 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to a suit filed by the endangered Species Committee of the Building Industry Association of Southern California
and the other plaintiffs, the United States District Court of the District of Columbia vacated the listing of the coastal
California gnatcatcher because the Service did not make available Atwood's data for public review and comment. In
response to the court decision, Dr. Atwood released his data to the Service, which the agency made available to the
public for review and comment on June 2, 1994. On June 16, 1994, the court reinstated threatened status for the coastal
California gnatcatcher until the Secretary of the Interior determines in a finding whether the listing should be
revised or revoked in light of his review of the subject data and public comments received during the comment period.
as a result of the court order of July 27, 1994, the Secretary must publish this finding in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 1, 1994, the plaintiffs requested a 100-day extension in the comment period. Because the Secretary had no objection
to a 30-day extension, both parties agreed to an extension in the comment period to August 31, 1994, which the Service
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 28, 1994 (59 FR 38426). On July 27, 1994, the court ordered the comment period extended to October 31, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's notice announces the Agency's third biennial plan for developing new and revised effluent guidelines pursuant
to sec. 304(m) of the Clean Water Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA published a proposed Effluent Guidelines Plan (the ``Proposed Plan'') on May 18, 1994 (59 FR 25859). The Agency
invited comment on the notice until June 17, 1994. Today's notice summarizes and addresses the major comments the
Agency received.

B. Overview of Today's Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency intends to develop effluent limitation guidelines and standards (``effluent guidelines'') as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Continue development of nine rules listed in the Proposed Plan. The categories are: Pulp, Paper and Paperboard;
Pesticide Chemicals (Formulating, Packaging and Repackaging); Coastal Oil and Gas Extraction; Centralized Waste
Treatment; Pharmaceutical Manufacturing; Metal Products and Machinery, Phase 1; Landfills and Incinerators;
Industrial Laundries; and Transportation Equipment Cleaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Begin development of effluent guidelines for the Metal Products and Machinery category, Phase 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Continue to initiate approximately two preliminary studies per year to assist in determining whether new or revised
rules should be developed for particular categories. Each preliminary study will generally take approximately
two years to complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Plan for development of eight additional effluent guidelines, either new or revised, between 1996 and 2003. The
point source categories to be covered by these guidelines will be identified in future 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices. EPA intends to begin development of two rules each year from 1996 to 1999, with proposed rules published between
1998 and 2001, and final action taken between 2000 and 2003 respectively.

III. 1994 Proposed Effluent Guidelines Plan

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Proposed Plan, EPA described its intent to continue development of nine ongoing rulemakings, develop eight
additional rules between 1996 and 2003, and conduct preliminary studies. The Proposed Plan set forth EPA's rationale
for the selection of particular industries as candidates for new or revised effluent guidelines. The Proposed Plan
also described the relevant statutory framework, the components and process for development of an effluent guidelines
regulation, and other background information. The principal elements of the Proposed Plan were designed to implement
sec. 304(m) and a consent decree in

a. Metal Products and Machinery Phase 2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 1992 consent decree requires that EPA begin rulemaking for the Metal Product and Machinery Phase 2 (MP&amp;M 2)
category in 1995. As announced in the 1992 Effluent Guidelines Plan (57 FR 41000, September 8, 1992), EPA intends to
propose the MP&amp;M 2 rule in 1997 and take final action in 1999.

b. Two Additional Rulemaking Projects: 1996 Start.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA will start work on two more rules in 1996. EPA has not yet selected the specific industrial categories for 1996.
However, based on the discussion of data sources in the Proposed Plan (59 FR 25863), the Agency may choose the next categories
from the following list: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Petroleum Refining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;a portion of the Pulp, Paper and Paperboard category (proposed subcategories for which EPA did not propose
toxic and nonconventional pollutant limits in the proposed rule published December 17, 1993: G. Mechanical Pulp;
H. Non-Wood Chemical Pulp; I. Secondary Fiber Deink; J. Secondary Fiber Non-Deink; K. Fine and Lightweight Papers

B. Preliminary Studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Proposed Plan EPA described six preliminary studies either completed or underway, and announced that it intended
to begin two preliminary studies in 1995, and three additional studies in 1996 (59 FR 25864&hyph;5). The studies assist
the Agency in selecting industries to be subject to future effluent guidelines rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proceeding as proposed with studies for the Textile Mills category (40 CFR part 410) and the Inorganic
Chemicals category (40 CFR part 415), both of which will be completed by December 1994. Studies of the Steam Electric
Power Generating category (40 CFR part 423) and Iron and Steel Manufacturing category (40 CFR part 420) were started
earlier this year will be complete in late 1995. Studies on the Petroleum Refining category (40 CFR part 419) and the
Metal Finishing category (40 CFR part 433) were recently completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three additional existing effluent guidelines categories are listed in the consent decree for preliminary studies:
Leather Tanning and Finishing (40 CFR part 425); Coal Mining (40 CFR part 434); and Onshore/Stripper Oil and Gas Extraction
(40 CFR part 435). EPA may study these categories or other categories, based on public comments received and other
available information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has not yet selected the categories to be studied in 1995 or 1996.

C. Summary of Changes from Proposed Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's Effluent Guidelines Plan is substantively identical to the Proposed Plan. However, some clarifications
are provided below in response to several comments the Agency received on the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The public comment period for the Proposed Plan closed on June 17, 1994. The Agency received comments that covered
approximately 18 topics from 6 commenters, including industries and an environmental group. The summary in this
section highlights the more significant comments submitted. The administrative record for today's notice includes
a complete text of the comments and the Agency's responses.

A. Scope of Specific Effluent Guidelines Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments addressed the scope of coverage and other issues pertaining to specific effluent guidelines rules
which EPA recently proposed or will propose in the next few years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will forward these comments to the dockets for the appropriate rules. The Agency has not made final decisions about
the scope and applicability of these guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Effluent Guidelines Planning Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment questioned the Agency's commitment to planning for the Effluent Guidelines Program, and stated that
EPA should demonstrate that it has actually engaged in planning for future development of Effluent Guidelines, rather
than using the 304(m) plan as a status report and vehicle to request further information from outside sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has devoted substantial resources to planning for Effluent Guidelines. Most significantly, the Agency has supported
the Effluent Guidelines Task Force, an advisory committee, that has investigated ways to improve the planning process,
expedite the promulgation of effluent guidelines, and better promote pollution prevention practices. The Task
Force recently submitted its Report and Recommendations on ``Selection Criteria for Preliminary Industry Studies''
to the EPA Administrator. The Task Force agreed with EPA on the limitations of various data sources, although it encouraged
the Agency to take greater advantage of the information and experience available from state and local governments
in dealing with industrial dischargers. EPA looks forward to working more closely with state and local governments
on preliminary studies and effluent guidelines planning in general. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Agency does invite submissions of data from outside sources to assist in Effluent Guidelines planning,
it also conducts preliminary industry studies. EPA believes that conducting preliminary studies is the most effective
manner in which to learn about industries discharging toxic and nonconventional pollutants. Two studies have been
completed, and additional studies are underway, pursuant to the Consent Decree. Consistent with the previous Plans,
the 1994 Proposed Plan states that the ``total priority pollutants discharged'' factor has been ``among the most
useful indicators for selecting categories for effluent guidelines'' (59 FR 25863). The preliminary studies provide
this kind of information, but most of the other data sources the Agency consults do not support calculating national
estimates of discharges by category.

VI. Economic Impact Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's notice proposes a plan for the review and revision of existing effluent guidelines and for the selection of
priority industries for new regulations. This notice does not establish any requirements; therefore, no economic
impact assessment has been prepared. EPA will provide economic impact analyses or regulatory impact analyses, as
appropriate, for all of the future effluent guideline rulemakings developed by the Agency.

VII. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of
the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this plan is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document gives notice to the public of the requirement that filing fees and handling fees be paid when informal
and formal reparation complaints are filed under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA), as required
by the enactment of Public Law 103&hyph;276.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public Law 103&hyph;276, signed by President Clinton on July 5, 1994, requires a filing fee of $60 for each informal
complaint, and a handling fee of $300 for each formal complaint filed under Section 6(a) of the PACA (7 U.S.C. 499f(a))
during fiscal years 1995 and 1996. Therefore, a $60 fee must accompany each informal complaint filed on or after October
1, 1994, through September 30, 1996, before it will be considered a valid complaint, processed, and investigated
by the agency. Informal complaints received without the fee will not toll the nine-month statute of limitations set
by Section 6(a) (7 U.S.C. 499f(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 7 CFR 47.3 of the Rules of Practice under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930, upon receipt
of the informal complaint and the filing fee, the Director of the Fruit and Vegetable Division of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) will cause such an investigation to be made as, in his or her opinion, is justified by the facts.
If such investigation reveals that no violation of the act has occurred, no further action shall be taken and the person
filing the informal complaint shall be so informed. In the alternative, pursuant to 7 CFR &sect;47.3(b)(2), the Director
may attempt to effect an amicable or informal adjustment of the matter. If this attempt fails, the complainant may
elect to proceed with a formal complaint pursuant to 7 CFR 47.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the filing fee, the complainant must submit a handling fee of $300 at the time of filing a formal complaint.
A copy of the formal complaint will not be served on the respondent until the $300 handling fee is paid. Counterclaims
filed under the PACA are considered new formal complaints and must be accompanied by the $300 handling fee before they
will be considered filed and served on the opposing party. In determining the amount of damages incurred by an injured
party, the Secretary will include the amount of the handling fee as additional damages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All payment instruments for fees shall be made payable to the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and shall be deposited
by the Agency into the account of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act Fund. Filing of both informal and formal
complaints will continue to be accomplished by providing the informal or formal complaint, accompanied by the appropriate
fee, to the Director of the Fruit and Vegetable Division of the AMS as prescribed in 7 CFR &sect;47.3 and &sect;47.6
of the Rules of Practice under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. Delivery of the complaint and fee to a
regional office of the PACA Branch of the Fruit and Vegetable Division is deemed to be delivery to the Director of the
Fruit and Vegetable Division. If a payment instrument is dishonored, the complainant will be allowed seven days to
replace it with a cashier's check or a certified check or the complaint proceedings will be terminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Government has been notified that the Provisional Technical Secretariat (PTS), predecessor to the Technical
Secretariat of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a new international organization
created by the Chemical Weapons Convention, is beginning the process of procuring inspection equipment for the evaluation
and use in training of inspectors. The PTS has requested that by October 1, 1994, each Member State identify companies
interested in bidding for contracts to provide such equipment. Upon receipt of names of interested companies, the
PTS will compile an initial tender list for each type of equipment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this information could be considered commercially sensitive, all responses will be classified as confidential
by the PTS and will be treated accordingly. Only the names and addresses of interested companies will be made available
to Member States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested companies must answer a questionnaire providing company and production information and return it to
the PTS in The Hague, The Netherlands, by October 1, 1994. Packages containing the questionnaire and specific information
about equipment needed by the PTS can be obtained by contacting ACDA at the address below.

 Notice is hereby given that the Bureau of the Census plans to conduct a Feature and Address Reference Source Assessment
Survey in the years 1995 through 1997 under the authority of Title 13, United States Code, Sections 141 and 193. The
Census Bureau would use the information collected to identify and acquire reference sources needed to update address
and geographic files that are critical for all three phases of the 2000 decennial census_data collection, data processing,
and data tabulation. The information to be collected is not available from any single source, either governmental
or nongovernmental.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Census Bureau will be the sole user of the information collected, and will use it to determine the reference sources
that are the most complete and up to date, vis-a-vis streets and addresses, for each geographic area, typically a county
or place. The identification and acquisition of complete and current reference sources are necessary for updating
the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) data base and creating the Master Address
File (MAF) so that the Census Bureau can use the TIGER data base to assign each structure number-street name address
in the MAF to the correct geographic location. The TIGER data base is a nationwide geographic data base that is used
for producing maps, organizing addresses, and tabulating statistical data. The MAF will be a permanent and continuously
maintained nationwide inventory of housing unit addresses to meet the needs of the Census Bureau's statistical programs.
The TIGER data base and the MAF are two critical components of the infrastructure to support the 2000 decennial census,
and the success of that census depends, to a great extent, on their completeness and currency.

PRELIMINARY CRITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES DETERMINATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Commerce (the Department) published its preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value
in this investigation on June 16, 1994 (54 FR 30911). On July 22, 1994, petitioner in this investigation alleged that
there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of certain
cased pencils from the People's Republic of China (PRC). On August 1, 1994, petitioner amended the original allegation,
submitting additional information regarding the existence of critical circumstances in this investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(b)(2)(ii), since this allegation was filed later than 20 days before the scheduled
date of the preliminary determination, we must issue our preliminary critical circumstances determination not
later than 30 days after the allegation was submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 733(e)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), provides that the Department will determine that
there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A)(i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of the investigation, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than is fair value, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over
a relatively short period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
History of Dumping
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this investigation, the first criterion of analysis is addressed in petitioner's July 22, 1994, submission. This
submission provides documentation indicating that in April 1994 the government of Mexico published an antidumping
duty order of 451 percent on certain cased pencils produced and exported from the PRC. Therefore, petitioner has established
that there is a history of dumping elsewhere of such pencils by PRC producers/exporters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Importer Knowledge
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the alternative first criterion, we have consistently determined that preliminary antidumping
duty margins in excess of 25 percent on U.S. purchase price sales are sufficient to impute importer knowledge of sales
at less than fair value. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicon Metal from China 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Extruded Rubber Thread from Malaysia 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(57 FR 38465, August 25, 1992). In this investigation, all responding and non-responding companies received preliminary
antidumping duty margins in excess of 25 percent. Therefore, we determine that importers either knew or should have
known that the exporter was selling certain cased pencils at less than fair value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Massive Imports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because we have preliminarily found that the first statutory criterion is met for finding critical circumstances
in that there is a history of dumping of the subject merchandise and, alternatively, there is actual or imputed importer
knowledge of sales at less than fair value, we must consider the second statutory criterion: whether imports of the
merchandise have been massive over a relatively short period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to 19 CFR 353.16(f) and 353.16(g), we consider the following to determine whether imports have been massive
over a relatively short period of time: (1) Volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable); and
(3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by the imports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When examining volume and value data, the Department typically compares the export volume for equal periods immediately
preceding and following the filing of the petition. Under 19 CFR 353.16(f)(2), unless the imports in the comparison
period have increased by at least 15 percent over the imports during the base period, we will not consider the imports
to have been ``massive.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether there have been massive imports over a relatively short period of time, the Department examines
shipment information submitted by the respondent or import statistics, when respondent-specific shipment information
is not available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 4, 1994, the Department sent letters to respondents requesting information regarding shipments of certain
cased pencils for the period January 1992 to May 1994. On August 16, 1994, we received the requested information filed
in proper form for each of the four responding companies. Because company-specific shipment data was provided by
the four responding companies in this investigation, we have used this data for our analysis.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether or not there have been massive imports of certain cased pencils over a relatively short period,
we compared each respondent's export volume for the seven months subsequent to the filing of the petition (November
1993 through May 1994) to that during the seven months prior to the filing of the petition (April through October 1993).
This period of review was selected based on the Department's practice of using the longest period for which information
is available from the month that the petition was filed through the effective date of the preliminary determination
of sales at less than fair value, which in this investigation was June 16, 1994. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, Preliminary Affirmative Determination of Critical Circumstances; Silicon Carbide From the People's Republic
of China
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 16795, April 8, 1994). We were unable to consider the share of domestic consumption accounted for by the imports,
pursuant to &sect;353.16(f)(1)(iii), because the available data did not permit such a post-filing analysis. In
addition, we found no evidence of seasonality, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(f)(1)(ii), with respect to PRC exports of
certain cased pencils to the U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on respondents' shipment information, we find that imports of certain cased pencils from the PRC have been massive
over a relatively short period for the following companies: Shanghai Foreign Trade Corporation (SFTC), Shanghai
Lansheng, Co., Ltd. (SLC), and China First Pencil Co., Ltd. (CFP). In addition, we find that imports from Guangdong
Stationery &amp; Sporting Goods I/E Corporation (GSSG), the other respondent in this investigation, have not been
massive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, because there is a history of dumping, and, alternatively, importers knew or should have known that the
exporters were selling the merchandise at less than its fair value, and because imports of certain cased pencils have
been massive over a relatively short period of time, we preliminarily determine that there is a reasonable basis to
believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of certain cased pencils from SFTC,
SLC, and CFP. Because imports from GSSG have not been massive, we preliminarily determine that there is not a reasonable
basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of certain cased pencils from
GSSG. In addition, with respect to all non-responding procedures/exporters of certain cased pencils from the PRC,
we preliminarily determine, as best information available, that critical circumstances exist.

Postponement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 28, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) issued affirmative preliminary determinations in
the antidumping duty investigations of stainless steel bar (SSB) from Japan (59 FR 39739, August 4, 1994) and Brazil
(59 FR 39732, August 4, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 26, 1994, Daido Steel Co., Ltd. (Daido); Aichi Steel Works, Ltd. (Aichi); Sanyo Special Steel Co., Ltd. (Sanyo)
(the three respondents in the Japanese investigation); Abe Bright Shaft Mfg. Co., Ltd.; Pacific Metals Co., Ltd.;
Tohoku Steel Co., Ltd.; Yamashin Steel Co., Ltd.; and Kansai Metal Industry Co., Ltd. (other Japanese exporters),
requested that the Department postpone the final determination in the Japanese investigation until 135 days after
the publication date of the preliminary determination in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in accordance with section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 1673d(a)(2)(A)).
Daido, Aichi, and Sanyo are Japanese exporters which accounted for a significant portion of exports of the subject
merchandise to the United States. On July 26, 1994, Acos Villares, S.A. (the Brazilian respondent), an exporter which
accounted for a significant portion of exports of the subject merchandise to the United States, requested that the
Department postpone the final determination in the Brazilian investigation until 135 days after the publication
date of the preliminary determination in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In both of these investigations the respondents requested a postponement in order to permit the Department to align
all of the related SSB investigations on one timetable, and thereby alleviate the administrative burden on all the
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 29 and August 1, 1994, petitioners submitted comments opposing respondents' request for a postponement of
the final determinations. In those submissions, petitioners claimed they would be adversely affected by a postponement
because importers would have the option of posting a bond in lieu of paying cash deposits of estimated antidumping
duties. Petitioners also asserted that there is no increase in the level of administrative convenience for any of
the parties if the final determinations are postponed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations provide that upon the receipt of a proper request, the Department will postpone the
final determination unless there are compelling reasons to deny the request (19 CFR 353.20(b)(1) (1994)). After
considering the respondents' and petitioners' comments, we find that petitioners will not be adversely affected
by a postponement of the final determinations. The preliminary results have already been issued and suspension of
liquidation is already in effect. In addition, several of the SSB investigations have already been postponed. Given
the complexity of these investigations as a whole, and the resulting increased burden on the Department to review
and analyze the documents submitted in these investigations, aligning all the SSB investigations will ease the administrative
burden on the Department. Therefore, in the context of these investigations, we have determined that the fact that
respondents will be able to post a bond in lieu of paying an actual cash deposit for a slightly longer period does not
rise to a compelling reason for denying the respondents' requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we are postponing the final determinations on Japan and Brazil to the full extent authorized under section
735(a)(2)(A) of the Tariff Act. The final determinations will be issued not later than December 19, 1994, which is
the due date for the previously extended investigations of SSB from India, Spain, and Italy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments must be submitted in at least ten copies to the
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than November 8, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than November
15, 1994. In addition, a public version and five copies should be submitted by the appropriate date if the submission
contains business proprietary information. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if
requested, to afford interested parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs.
If requested, hearings are tentatively scheduled on November 17, 1994, at 2:00 p.m. for the Japanese investigation
and on November 17 1994, at 3:00 p.m. for the Brazilian investigation. Both hearings will be held at the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Room 1414, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington D.C., 20230. Parties should confirm
by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before the scheduled time.

Decision: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approved. No instrument of equivalent scientific value to the foreign instrument, for such purposes as these instruments
are intended to be used, was being manufactured in the United States at the time the instruments were ordered. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasons: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each foreign instrument is a conventional transmission electron microscope (CTEM) and is intended for research
or scientific educational uses requiring a CTEM. We know of no CTEM, or any other instrument suited to these purposes,
which was being manufactured in the United States either at the time of order of each instrument or at the time of receipt
of application by the U.S. Customs Service.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 27, 1993, June 24 and July 1, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled
published notices (58 FR 68398, 59 FR 32686 and 33958) of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additions to the Procurement List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the services listed below are suitable for procurement by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors considered for this certification were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than the small organizations that will furnish the services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current contractors for the services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would

A. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Examination of Records by Comptroller General clause and the two audit clauses, Audit_Negotiation and Audit_Formal
Advertising, implement the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2313, 41 U.S.C. 254, and 10 U.S.C. 2306. The statutory requirements
are that the Comptroller General and/or agency shall have access to, and the right to, examine certain books, documents
and records of the contractor for a period of 3 years after final payment. The record retention periods required of
the contractor in the clauses are for compliance with the aforementioned statutory requirements. The information
must be retained so that audits necessary for contract surveillance, verification of contract pricing, and reimbursement
of contractor costs can be performed.

 Notice is hereby given that on November 26, 1990, an arbitration panel rendered a decision in the matter of

Tennessee Department of Human Services (Docket No. R&hyph;S/88&hyph;91). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This panel was convened by the U.S. Department of Education pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act (the Act), 20 U.S.C.
107d&hyph;1(a), upon receipt of a complaint filed by petitioners, Messrs. Gardner, Sadikoff, and Shepherd, on July
22, 1988. The Randolph-Sheppard Act governs the operation of vending facilities by blind vendors on local, State,
and Federal property and provides a priority for blind individuals to operate those facilities on Federal property.
Under this section of the Randolph-Sheppard Act, a blind licensee dissatisfied with the State's operation or administration
of the vending facility program authorized under the Act may request a full evidentiary hearing from the State licensing
agency (SLA). If the licensee is dissatisfied with the State agency's decision, the licensee may file a complaint
with the Secretary, who is then required to convene an arbitration panel to resolve the dispute.

David Gardner, Charles Sadikoff, and Curtis M. Shepherd, complainants, are blind vendors licensed by the respondent,
the Tennessee Department of Human Services, the SLA, pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107 et seq.
The SLA, through its Department of Rehabilitation, operates the Tennessee Vending Facility Program for blind vendors.
The purpose of the program is to establish and support blind vendors operating vending facilities on Federal property.
As the agency designated in Tennessee to carry out and manage the vending facility program established by the Act,
the SLA duly promulgated rules and regulations to govern the State's program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In December 1985, the SLA's rules and regulations were revised regarding classifications of facility types and the
licensing of vendors. Five categories were established for vending facilities (all vending, counter and vending,
counter service, on-site food preparation, and cafeteria). All of the existing vending facilities were placed into
one of these categories by the SLA and the Committee of Blind Vendors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, all current licensed managers who had received training at the SLA's training center after April 1977
were certified in the type of facility they operated at the time the new rules were implemented. The new rules provided
that, after certification to operate a category of vending facility, the manager was required to attend one training
session at the SLA's training center in Smyrna, Tennessee, within a two-year period following certification and
every two years thereafter in order for the manager to maintain certification. Failure by a vendor to comply with this
rule precluded the manager from assuming a location as the result of a bid on a facility opening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the rule change required that a manager be certified to operate a particular type of facility in order to obtain
a promotion into that facility by bid or to obtain a transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complainants were notified in January 1986 that each vendor's certification was to be terminated because each
had failed to attend an Upward Mobility Training Session at the SLA's center during the two-year period following
their initial certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each complainant alleged individual circumstances that prohibited them from attendance at a training session.
Also, each complainant asked the SLA to adopt a uniform standard for blind vendors who wanted to use an alternative
method to obtain continuing certification if the manager was unable to attend the SLA's training sessions, which
usually required overnight travel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 12, 1988, the complainants jointly filed for an evidentiary hearing, which was held on April 5, 1988, challenging
the SLA's decision not to extend their certifications and requesting that the SLA allow them to show cause why they
were unable to participate in the required training for recertification, as well as allow them to seek an alternative
method of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Shepherd operates a vending facility at the Moccasin Bend Psychiatric Hospital and has done so for approximately
12 years. He alleged at the evidentiary hearing that he was unable to attend training due to constant care of two elderly
aunts who reside with him. However, the SLA had informed Mr. Shepherd in March 1988 that his certification would be
extended due to his personal situation. Mr. Shepherd declined the SLA's offer of certification extension in favor
of an evidentiary hearing, thereby attempting to establish a uniform procedure for exempting any manager from attending
training at the SLA's center if a manager has problems that prohibit attendance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Sadikoff operates a vending facility at the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Mr. Gardner operates a vending facility
at the Memphis Mental Health Institute. Both indicated they did not have confidence in anyone operating their respective
vending locations during the three or four days they would be absent to attend mandatory SLA training for recertification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 3, 1988, the Hearing Officer rendered a decision that was subsequently adopted as final agency action by the
SLA on June 17, 1988. The decision of the Hearing Officer upheld the SLA's extension of Mr. Shepherd's certification
for one year beyond the anticipated expiration due to the medical circumstances of his relatives. The Hearing Officer
indicated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the SLA rules do not allow for a vendor to decline such an extension. The vendor may decline a particular type of certification;
however, once certified to operate a particular type of facility, an extension of that certification is solely within
the purview of the SLA. Also, the Hearing Officer ruled that the termination of both Mr. Sadikoff's and Mr. Gardner's
certification was upheld. The evidence provided at the hearing clearly showed that neither vendor made any real effort
during a two-year period following their current certification to attend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a training session for recertification nor was a valid reason given for not complying with the SLA requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complainants expressed dissatisfaction with the final agency action and filed a request for a Federal arbitration
panel to be convened. An arbitration hearing was held on February 12, 1990.

Arbitration Panel Decision

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The central issue addressed by the arbitration panel was whether the State licensing agency can require retraining
of licensed vendors at a specific rehabilitation center within the State in order to retain vendor certification
to operate facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The panel in a majority opinion dismissed Mr. Gardner's complaint as moot because the parties agreed that he subsequently
attended and completed the required four-day training course in Smyrna, thus complying with the SLA's requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the arbitration panel concurred with the SLA's position of allowing complainant Sadikoff to continue to operate
his current facility but declaring him ineligible for promotion, transfer, or demotion due to his refusal to take
the required training. Complainant Sadikoff indicated his inability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
find a person he could trust to manage his facility as the major factor in not completing the required training at Smyrna.
The panel found this position to be unreasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The panel further ruled that the SLA acted properly in requiring Mr. Shepherd to attend upward mobility training and,
further, acted properly and within its scope of authority in granting the extension of time for Mr. Shepherd to attend
a training session. The panel member designated by the com- plainants dissented. That panel member interpreted the
Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 U.S.C. 107d&hyph;4, and the regulations in 34 CFR 395.11 as requiring the SLA to provide training to licensed blind
vendors and to make accommodations for those blind vendors who are unable to attend a regularly scheduled training
session.

State of Nebraska, Department of Public Institutions, Division of Rehabilitative Services (Docket No. R&hyph;S/90&hyph;3).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This panel was convened by the U.S. Department of Education pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 107d-1(a) upon receipt of the original
complaint filed by petitioner Fred Scarpello on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 2, 1990, and subsequently amended on June 3, 1991. The Randolph-Sheppard Act (the Act) creates a priority
for blind individuals to operate vending facilities on Federal property. Under the Act, a blind licensee dissatisfied
with the State's operation or administration of the vending facility program authorized under the Act may request
a full evidentiary hearing from the State licensing agency (SLA). If the licensee is dissatisfied with the State agency's
decision, the licensee may complain to the Secretary, who is then required to convene an arbitration panel to resolve
the dispute.

decisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The complainant, Fred V. Scarpello, is a blind vendor licensed by the Nebraska Department of Public Institutions,
the SLA under the provisions of the Act. Pursuant to a permit approved in 1978 by the U.S. Postal Service and a vendor
operator's agreement between Mr. Scarpello and the SLA, Mr. Scarpello operates a vending facility on the second floor
of the Main Post Office, 1124 Pacific Street, Omaha, Nebraska. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, the SLA submitted two applications for permits for the second floor of the Main Post Office. One permit covered
the operation of a ``snack bar facility,'' and attachment ``C'' to that application specified the items to be sold
as ``hot foods and salads.'' The other permit represented an updated permit and covered the items that Mr. Scarpello
was in fact already vending under his current vending agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SLA granted the complainant's request for an evidentiary hearing. The issues that Mr. Scarpello wanted the arbitration
panel to address were whether the SLA was splitting his location into two separate locations with separate permits
that would allow for another vendor, and if that were the case, whether he would be entitled to have the additional location
and permit automatically awarded to him. The State hearing officer ruled that the two permits already had been issued
and that the complainant was not jeopardized by the new permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July, 1990, Mr. Scarpello filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the State of Nebraska against the Director
of the SLA and the U.S. Postal Service requesting that construction and remodeling of the new facilities be halted.
This suit resulted in a settlement agreement and a dismissal of the action without prejudice on September 21, 1990.
The settlement agreement permitted the Postal Service to proceed with planned construction and remodeling of the
second floor lunchroom pursuant to the two permits that already had been approved. However, the parties agreed that
the hot food line would not be implemented pending the outcome of the arbitration panel decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Arbitration Panel Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The arbitration panel ruled that the SLA, by entering into a vending agreement with the Postal Service to provide hot
food service, did not violate the vending agreement between the SLA and Mr. Scarpello and that complainant's license
was not being compromised. The new permit for the second facility described the facility as a ``Snack Bar Facility,''
and the attachments to the Hot Food Permit made it clear that the services provided were different from the complainant's
1978 permit that was being updated. The SLA's decision to move, remodel, and enlarge the location and size of the food
facilities on the second floor of the Main Post Office was in response to requests from postal employees to have an expanded
dining area and to have served hot food different from the vended food that was available. The decision to offer hot
foods and salads also meant that different equipment and facility design would be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Panel rejected complainant's argument that he should be the vendor involved in any vending agreement issued pursuant
to the ``Hot Food Permit'' because it would reduce his income and provide unfair competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The panel ruled that the Hot Food Permit did not provide for a facility similar to that of complainant and that there
is nothing in the Randolph-Sheppard Act or regulations that prohibits competition among blind vendors. The panel
considered that, if the SLA were to have proposed entering into an agreement to provide an identical facility as complainant's,
a different issue would be involved. Accordingly, the panel held that the SLA could enter into a vending agreement
with another blind licensee pursuant to the ``Hot Food Permit.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One panel member dissented, arguing that complainant's original permit and agreement allowed him to serve hot food
and to sell and serve salads prepared off the premises and sold over his counter and from the vending machines. This
panel member believed that any change in the permit should have included a discussion and concurrence by the Committee
of Blind Vendors pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 107(b)(l)(2). This panel member stated that the permit for ``hot food'' service
was in violation of the vending agreement between the SLA and the complainant and that entering into another vending
agreement with a vendor other than Mr. Scarpello violated the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Complainant Scarpello filed a motion in U.S. District Court for the State of Nebraska on August 14, 1992, seeking judicial
review of the panel's decision. The court ruled in an opinion dated June 13, 1994, that plaintiff (Scarpello) failed
to show that the ``arbitration panel's decision was arbitrary and capricious and insupportable on any rational basis.''
The District Court found that the evidence supported the panel's ruling that Mr. Scarpello's vending permit did not
include ``hot food and salads'' and that his permit was not being split as the result of the SLA receiving a second permit
for another vending location at the same site as plaintiff. Likewise, the court found that the evidence supported
the panel's conclusion that the new permit did not threaten plaintiff's livelihood. The District Court ruled that
plaintiff's complaint should be dismissed and that the arbitration panel decision should be affirmed.

Based upon a determination, pursuant to 10 CFR Part 600.7(b)(2), which authorizes a financial assistance award to
be made noncompetitively if the activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of an activity presently
being funded by DOE or another federal agency, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse
effect on continuity or completion of the activity, AL gives notice of its intent to renew its current grant with Princeton
University under the project entitled ``Multi-Dimensional Measurements and Computations of Engine Flows and Combustion.''
The public purpose to be served by this renewal is to integrate the understanding of fuel injection processes and the
fluid mechanics of combustion into current multi-dimensional models. Research in this program includes the development
and testing of detailed spray models and the use of practical engines and injectors. The research is a continuation
of work performed by Princeton under its current grant with DOE. The renewal period will be for four years. The government's
funding of this grant is subject to the availability of funds.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces the availability of a draft supplemental environmental impact statement
(SEIS) for the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DOE/EIS&hyph;0082&hyph;S&hyph;D) at the Savannah River Site,
Aiken, South Carolina. The document supplements an EIS that DOE issued in 1982 (DOE/EIS&hyph;0082) to construct
and operate the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The draft SEIS assesses the potential environmental impacts
of completing and operating the DWPF, as modified since 1982, to immobilize high-level radioactive waste at the Savannah
River Site by incorporating the waste into borosilicate glass by a process called vitrification. The draft SEIS also
addresses the potential impacts of no action and of alternative pretreatment processes for the waste. DOE invites
public comments on the draft SEIS, and will hold public hearings on the document.

Each session will begin with presentations regarding the proposed action and an opportunity for discussion and questions
by the public. After approximately one hour, the formal hearing will begin, and public comments will be recorded by
a court reporter. The moderator of the hearing may ask clarifying questions to ensure that comments are understood,
but will not across-examine the commenter. Additional procedural guidance will be provided by the moderator at the
start of the hearings. To allow all interested parties an opportunity to speak, five minutes will be allotted to each
individual or representative of a group. More speaking time may be available, depending upon the number of people
who wish to comment at a specific hearing. Commenters are requested to provide DOE with written copies of their oral
comments if possible. Individuals who wish to preregister to speak at any of the hearings may do so by calling (800)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 DOE proposes to conduct various activities within floodplains and wetlands on or surrounding the Pantex Plant in
Carson County, 17 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas. The proposed activities would include Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA) or Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) site
characterization investigations such as environmental monitoring and surveillance activities as well as wastewater
and storm water discharges. In accordance with 10 CFR part 1022, DOE will prepare a floodplain/wetland assessment
and will perform these proposed actions in a manner so as to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected
floodplain and wetlands.

 DOE proposes to conduct various activities within floodplains and wetlands on and surrounding the Pantex Plant.
Site characterization activities would be conducted in support of the Permit for Industrial Solid Waste Management
Site issued by the Texas Water Commission (now known as the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission) as part
of DOE's effort to determine the nature and extent of any environmental contamination resulting from Pantex operations.
These activities would occur within Solid Waste Management Units (SWMU) 6 (Playa Basin 1), SWMU 7 (Playa Basin 2),
SWMU 8 (Playa Basin 3), SWMU 9 (Playa Basin 4), and SWMU 10 (Pantex Lake). Additional characterization may be required
as a result of the site being listed on the National Priorities List. Specific activities would include but not be limited
to the following:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1.1&blank;Installation of monitoring wells. Monitoring wells would be drilled into the perched groundwater zone
if found to be present in the proposed locations. If the perched groundwater is not present, wells may be completed
into the High Plains Aquifer (locally known as the Ogallala Aquifer). Well drilling would involve limited driving
of heavy equipment into the proposed areas for the purpose of drilling and boring. Twenty-four-hour pump tests would
be conducted following completion of any monitoring wells. Water produced from any pump tests would be discharged
to the playas if the analytical testing results allow for such disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.2&blank;Surface water samples, ditch sediment samples, and vadose zone samples. Surface water sampling would
consist of collecting a sample bottle for surface water. Site access would be by wading. Sediment sampling would consist
of taking a sample of the sediment with a hand auger or with a vibrating core sampling device. The sediment samples would
typically be two inches in diameter and one foot deep. Access would be by walking or wading if water is present. Proposed
boreholes for vadose zone samples would include borings ranging in depths from 4 feet to 30 feet. Borehole drilling
would involve driving a drilling rig to the site, drilling the boreholes, and collecting the core samples as the drilling
progresses. The boreholes would be closed by backfilling with the cuttings and/or five percent bentonite/cement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.3&blank;Environmental monitoring and surveillance activities. DOE would conduct activities including: collection
of groundwater, surface water, vegetation, soil, and sediment samples, installation and maintenance of environmental
monitoring equipment, and routine monitoring and downloading of information from installed instrumentation in
various locations within the wetlands and floodplains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, DOE would continue to discharge industrial and storm water from existing outfalls to Playas 1, 2, and
4; discharge storm water to Playa 3, and discharge treated domestic wastewater to Playa 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE proposes to assess any floodplains/wetlands impacts associated with Texas Tech University's agricultural
operations including grazing in the wetlands and floodplains, and farming and related activities in the floodplains.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with DOE regulations for compliance with floodplain and wetlands environmental review requirements
(10 CFR Part 1022), DOE will prepare a floodplain/wetland assessment for these proposed DOE actions which may be incorporated
into the appropriate National Environmental Policy Act documentation. After DOE issues the assessment, a floodplain
statement of findings will be published in the

Section 3131 of the Act (42USC7274d(6)), enacted on December 5, 1991, addresses the issue of worker training at nuclear
weapons facilities. Subsection (a) provides for the awarding of grants to train workers and to develop training curricula.
Subsection (b) provides for the assessment of civil penalties against any DOE contractor who fails to provide training
to its employees who are engaged in hazardous substance response or emergency response at DOE nuclear weapons facilities.
Subsection (b) requires that penalties shall be assessed against any contractor who fails to provide the training,
or fails to certify to DOE that its employees are adequately trained for such response pursuant to orders issued by
DOE relating to employee safety training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act), Pub. L. No. 91&hyph;596, contractor
employee health and safety protection at DOE nuclear facilities has been exempt from Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) enforcement under section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act. This section provides that the OSH Act does
not apply to working conditions of employees if another Federal or state agency exercises statutory authority to
prescribe or enforce standards or regulations affecting occupational safety and health (OSH). DOE, as well as its
predecessor agencies, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration, has
exercised such authority with regard to contractor employees at facilities operated under authority of the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 5, 1993, the Secretary of Energy announced a number of safety and health initiatives stressing the need for the
Department to operate on a par with private industry in the safety and health arena. One of those initiatives involved
the commencement of consultations with OSHA with the aim of establishing OSHA regulation of all DOE facilities. The
Secretary recognized, however, that OSHA is not now ready to undertake regulation of DOE activities, and in light
of the significant issues that must be addressed prior to the implementation of OSHA jurisdiction, the Department
anticipates that a transition period of three to five years is necessary. Nonetheless, the Department is currently
obligated to implement the enforcement authority of section 3131(b) of the Act, and intends to do so as an interim measure
pending the transition to OSHA jurisdiction. The Department believes that implementation of this enforcement authority
during the transition period will help to ensure that the training requirements for contractor employees are met.
DOE invites the public to comment on its plans to implement its enforcement authority pursuant to section 3131(b)
of the Act.

Background and Legislative History

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3131 of the Act contains two substantive provisions aimed at addressing the concern of Congress regarding
the adequacy of worker safety training for employees handling hazardous substances, and responding to emergencies
involving hazardous substances, at the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Subsection (a) authorizes the Secretary
to award grants to nonprofit organizations that have demonstrated (as determined by the Secretary) capabilities
in providing safety and health training and in involving, in training, groups of workers whose duties include hazardous
substance response or emergency response. The Secretary is required to give preference to employee organizations
and joint labor-management training programs that are grant recipients under section 126(g) of the Superfund Amendments
and Reauthorization Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. 9660a, a program administered by the National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences (NIEHS). The Department has entered into an agreement with NIEHS to award and administer the grants
provided under section 3131(a) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3131(b), the subject of this notice, provides that the Secretary shall assess civil penalties of up to $5,000
per day against any DOE contractor who, as determined by the Secretary, fails to provide training for employees engaged
in hazardous substance response or emergency response, or who fails to certify to the Department that its employees
are adequately trained for such response pursuant to DOE orders relating to employee safety training. Because of
this statutory mandate, DOE does not intend to consider a reduction in contractor award fees in lieu of payment of civil
penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is required by section 3131(c) to prescribe regulations for the implementation of these requirements.
The Department intends to proceed with rulemaking after completion of its review of the comments and materials received
in response to this Notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3131(d) provides that the term ``hazardous substance'' includes both radioactive waste and mixed radioactive
and hazardous waste. The Department intends also to cover substances identified within the definition of hazardous
substance in section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
(CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601.101(14)). The statute does not define the term ``nuclear weapons facility.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3131 places on the contractor the burden of conducting required training, certifying the completion of such
training, and keeping records to document that the training requirement has been satisfied. In developing its implementing
regulations, DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments on the following matters: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1_DOE intends to make contractors responsible for maintaining all documentation related to the hazardous substance
and emergency response training of their work force. DOE will consider what, if any, data should be kept, and in what
format. DOE's goal will be to provide easy review for DOE field inspectors while minimizing the burden on contractors.
DOE also is considering requiring a wallet-sized photo identification card for each trained employee that would
contain, among other things, the date of refresher training, giving DOE the opportunity to document training in the
field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2_Section 3131 permits DOE contractors to certify that employees have been adequately trained and do not need additional
training. DOE seeks comment on the most effective and efficient way for the employer to certify that employees are
adequately trained especially in those cases where the employer does not actually provide the training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3_One objective of section 3131(b) is to ensure that all employees who are, or may be, engaged in hazardous substance
response or emergency response at the Department's nuclear weapons facilities receive adequate safety training.
DOE has the further objective of ensuring that any enforcement program is structured to provide appropriate incentives
for DOE contractors to comply with DOE requirements applicable to this training, including self-identification,
reporting, and prompt correction of deficiencies. Comments are requested on these objectives and on ways to achieve
these objectives in an effective and efficient manner for both DOE and its contractors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
4_The Department is also developing criteria for assessing the adequacy of contractor training programs for employees
engaged in hazardous substance or emergency response operations. These criteria will be used by DOE field inspectors
to evaluate and certify the adequacy of contractor training programs. DOE seeks comment on the development of appropriate
criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5_The Act defines the term ``hazardous substance'' to include radioactive waste and mixed radioactive and hazardous
waste. This definition is not limited, however, to those substances. For purposes of the implementing regulations,
DOE intends to include within the definition of hazardous substance, in addition to radioactive and mixed waste,
those substances identified within the definition of hazardous substance in section 101(14) of CERCLA. DOE seeks
comments on this definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6_DOE is considering defining ``nuclear weapons facility'' as follows: ``Any DOE reactor or non-reactor nuclear
facility involved in research, production, assembly, storage, dismantling, or disposal of nuclear weapons, or
material for nuclear weapons, that generates or contains hazardous substances, radioactive waste or mixed radioactive
and hazardous waste.'' Comments are requested on this definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7_Comments are requested on the enforcement procedures that are appropriate to assure compliance with the intent
of Congress, including the desirability of integration of the section 3131(b) enforcement procedures with the proposed
DOE program set forth at 10 CFR Part 820, for enforcing violations of nuclear safety requirements which includes assessment
of civil penalties under separate statutory authority, and whether the Department should provide for exemption
from dual civil penalty assessments under both Part 820 and the Act. Comments are also requested on enforcement options
such as varying penalty levels commensurate with the severity of the violation, past performance and multiple violations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE solicits comments on all of these issues and objectives, and on ways to achieve these objectives in an effective
and efficient manner for both DOE and its contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon completion of its review of all comments received and other relevant materials, DOE will develop a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking for publication in the

Energy Corporation for its urban distribution system. The Maximum net electric power production capacity of 38.9
MW will be purchased by Philadelphia Electric Company. The primary energy source of the facility will be natural gas.
Installation of the facility is expected to commence on or before November 4, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or objecting to the granting of qualifying status should file a motion to intervene

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Energy in compliance with the provisions of Section 2304 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is developing
a Management Plan for the Conduct of Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial Application of Energy
Technologies. The Plan is being developed in consultation with the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board that serves
as the Energy Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial Application Advisory Board, as called for in
the Act. The Plan provides an inventory and status report of technologies to enhance energy supply and to improve the
efficiency of energy end uses. The inventory and status report includes fossil, renewable, nuclear, and energy conservation
technologies which have not yet achieved the status of fully reliable and cost-competitive commercial availability,
but which the Secretary projects may become available with additional research, development, and demonstration.
The inventory and status report provides, for each technology_ (1) An assessment of its_ (A) Degree of technological
maturity, (B) principal research, development, and demonstration issues, including_ (i) the barriers posed by
capital, operating, and maintenance costs; (ii) technical performance; and (iii) potential environmental impact;
(2) the projected time frame for commercial availability, specifying at a minimum whether the technology will be
commercially available in the near-term, mid-term, or long-term, whether there are too many uncertainties to project
availability, or whether it is unlikely that the technology will ever be commercial; and (3) a projection of the future
cost-competitiveness of the technology in comparison with alternative technologies to provide the same energy
service.

extensions for applicable standards through demonstration of early emission reductions, in accordance with the
regulations implementing section 112(i)(5) of the Clean Air Act (see 40 CFR part 63, subpart D). Sources may obtain
a six-year extension of compliance with standards promulgated under section 112(d), if the source demonstrates
achievement of early reduction of HAP by 90 percent (95 percent for particulates), before proposal of an applicable
section 112(d) standard. Industry respondents must submit a one-time demonstration of reductions achieved. State
or local permitting agencies will evaluate these demonstrations for the purpose of granting compliance extensions.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given that the State of Georgia is revising its approved State Public Water Supply Supervision Primacy
Program. Georgia has adopted drinking water regulations for the Phase V (Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOC), Synthetic
Organic Chemicals (SOC), and Inorganic Chemicals (IOC) Rule. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined
that this set of State program revisions is no less stringent than the corresponding federal regulations. Therefore,
EPA has tentatively decided to approve this State program revision.

EPA expressed environmental concerns based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential air and water quality impacts. Additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and clarification is needed to: identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the extent of air quality impacts and their conformity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to SIP requirements for the area; clarify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical aspects regarding a variance request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of a landfill in a sole source aquifer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA had environmental concerns and requests that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FHWA Record of Decision recognize two major issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the GSA FEIS which FHWA intends to adopt: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the U.S. Congress has not appropriated funding for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater treatment facility at the New River in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calexico and (2) that any future proposal to reverse or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dam the Alamo River to prevent transboundary sewage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flows into the U.S. would be a major Federal action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring the preparation of an EIS or EIS supplement.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will
comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill
permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are
submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the
STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes
may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have
an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the
owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in State/Tribes
with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal
permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the
permit status of any facility, the Federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. The components
of authority and capability were contained in Puerto Rico's application and its revisions. EPA reviewed Puerto Rico's
application, and certain revisions thereto, and on March 23, 1994, proposed a determination that Puerto Rico's MSWLF
permit program is adequate to ensure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. Puerto Rico's revised regulation
as adopted by the Environmental Quality Board, pursuant to Commonwealth law, is titled the Non-Hazardous Solid Waste
Management Regulation. After consideration of all comments received regarding the tentative determination of
adequacy, EPA is today issuing a final determination that the Commonwealth's program is adequate.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that facilities comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA
determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply
with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing
a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs
must satisfy to be determined adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements
for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several
minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that
are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also
must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b)(1) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal
Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program
before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 8, 1993, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico submitted an application for adequacy determination for Puerto
Rico's municipal solid waste landfill permit program. On February 17, 1994, Puerto Rico made a revised submission.
On March 23, 1994, after reviewing Puerto Rico's application and the revised submission, EPA published a tentative
determination of adequacy for all portions of Puerto Rico's program. Further background on the tentative determination
of adequacy appears at 59 FR 13707, March 23, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment. Puerto
Rico's application for program adequacy determination and its revisions were available for public review and comment
at the EPA Region II Caribbean Field Office in San Juan and at the EPA Region II Library in New York City. The public comment
period commenced on March 23, 1994 and ended on May 26, 1994. The public comment period was originally scheduled to
end on May 12, 1994. However, at a public hearing held on May 12, 1994, a request was made to extend the comment period
and EPA responded by extending the comment period until May 26, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a hearing on any determination to approve a State/Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region scheduled four public hearings on this tentative determination. Two public hearings were held at the Solid
Waste Management Authority in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico on May 11, 1994. Two additional hearings were held at the Mayag&uuml;ez
City Hall in Mayag&uuml;ez, Puerto Rico on May 12, 1994. A summary of the comments received, and EPA's responses thereto
is contained in the public comment section of this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 4, 1993, Puerto Rico, acting through its Environmental Quality Board, adopted comprehensive, revised
regulations governing solid waste disposal. These regulations are patterned after the 40 CFR part 258 criteria,
and are intended to bring Puerto Rico into full conformity with the Federal criteria. The Puerto Rico Environmental
Quality Board has sufficient authority and responsibility for implementing and enforcing solid waste management
regulations, including a permit
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, inspection authority and enforcement activities. In addition, in its application, Puerto Rico states
that adequate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical, support and legal personnel will be assigned to implement its permit program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A summary of the public comments received on the tentative determination of adequacy and EPA's responses thereto
follows below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of the commenters suggested that the Environmental Quality Board (EQB), Puerto Rico's regulating agency,
may not effectively implement and enforce the Commonwealth's new MSWLF regulations. Commenters cited evidence
of problems they believe had occurred or currently exist at particular landfill sites and which they feel EQB had not
properly addressed. The EQB, however, has instituted a new structure for implementing and enforcing its new MSWLF
permit program, which was developed in order to meet part 258 requirements. Upon reviewing EQB's MSWLF permit program,
EPA Region II believes that problems related to regulatory oversight, will be effectively addressed under the EQB's
new program. Among the changes to the program is the implementation of a new management and staffing structure. In
addition, the number of employees working on the program and the number of hours of inspection and compliance training
provided to staff have increased dramatically. These changes will allow the EQB to inspect landfills semi-annually
whereas inspections previously took place only once per year or in some cases every other year under the previous program.
Inspections by technicians at the Solid Waste Management Authority, which take place an average of 2 to 3 times per
year at each landfill, will also be performed and the results of those inspections made available to EQB. Step by-step
procedures for receiving and responding to public complaints, which did not exist under the previous program will
also help the EQB to monitor landfills and permit a more efficient public participation process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that Puerto Rico presents a different ecological situation than is found in the States, and one
where it is more difficult to find a suitable location for a landfill. This commenter felt that the Federal Government
should modify its regulations for location criteria of municipal solid waste landfills to take into account that
there are locations with different situations. EPA feels that the Federal regulations, 40 CFR part 258, already contain
sufficient flexibility, particularly in location standards to allow an approved state to consider local conditions.
The use of the flexibility, however, does require that certain environmental protection performance standards
still be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters expressed concern that the location of landfills in Puerto Rico may violate President Clinton's Executive
Order on Environmental Justice. The Federal Government, including EPA, is currently engaged in preparing a national
strategy that will establish procedures to implement this order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were additional comments related to oversight of EQB by EPA, coordination between EQB and the Solid Waste Management
Authority, siting requirements, and groundwater protection. All the foregoing comments and several additional
comments that were not relative to the subject of the public hearing are addressed in the responsiveness summary which
is made part of the public record.

After reviewing the public comments, I conclude that Puerto Rico's application for adequacy determination meets
all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
is granted a determination of adequacy for all portions of its municipal solid waste permit program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action takes effect on [insert date of publication here]. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d)
of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All of the requirements and obligations in the Commonwealth's program are already in effect as a matter of Commonwealth
law. EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements that the regulated community must begin to comply with.
Nor do these requirements become enforceable by EPA as Federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to
give notice prior to making its approval effective.

impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This notice,
therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

various requirements of the MPPP should result in mortgagors, following receipt of notification of the need for flood
insurance, showing evidence of such a policy or purchasing the necessary coveragee through their local insurance
agent or appropriate Write Your Own (WYO) company. It is intended that flood insurance policies be written under the
MPPP only as a last resort, and only on mortgages whose mortgagors have failed to respond to the various notifications
required by the program.

<DOCTITLE>Federal Open Market Committee; Domestic Policy Directive of July 5-6, 1994</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with  271.5 of its rules regarding availability of information (12 CFR part 271), there is set forth below
the domestic policy directive issued by the Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting held on July 5-6, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The directive was issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
1 Copies of the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting of July 5-6, 1994, which include the domestic policy
directive issued at that meeting, are available upon request to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
Washington, D.C. 20551. The minutes are published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin and in the Board's annual report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity recorded another substantial gain in the
second quarter, causing levels of resource utilization to rise further. Increases in nonfarm payroll employment
have been relatively large on average in recent months; the civilian unemployment rate is reported to have declined
to 6.0 percent in May. The rise in industrial production slackened in April and May, primarily because capacity constraints
prevented normal seasonal increases in the production of motor vehicles. Growth in consumer spending has slowed
in recent months after very large increases in February and March. Housing starts have rebounded from winter disruptions
to a pace close to the elevated fourth-quarter level. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong
uptrend in spending on business equipment, while nonresidential construction has recovered from a weather-depressed
level in the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was larger in April than in March
but about unchanged from the average for the first quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices
have remained moderate in recent months, though prices of many basic industrial materials have risen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 17, 1994, the Board of Governors approved an increase in the discount rate from 3 to 3-1/2 percent. Most market
interest rates were up slightly on balance since the May meeting; declines in bond yields early in the intermeeting
period were offset later by market reactions to a weakening dollar in foreign exchange markets and rising commodity
prices. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was down significantly further
on balance over the intermeeting period, reflecting a sizable drop since early June.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
M2 and M3 declined on average over May and June; for the year through June, both M2 and M3 are at the bottom of their ranges
for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote
sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges
it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from
the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing
to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent
with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained
at 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from
the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee
provisionally set the associated monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995.
The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability,
movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure
on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable
economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly
greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.
The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
``which the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto''. In determining whether a
proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the matters set forth in

 516 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are (1) Whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed
services, (2) whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the
proposed services as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services, and (3) whether banks generally
provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require their provision in a specialized
form. See 516 F.2d at 1237. In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity
has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation
Y, 49 FR 806 (1984).

Applicants maintain that the Board previously has determined that the proposed data processing and transmission
services and stored value card services, when conducted within the limitations established by the Board in its regulations
and prior orders, are closely related to banking within the meaning of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. See 12 CFR 225.25(b)(7);

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice delegates and redelegates authority from the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to certain HUD
officials to grant time extensions to Public Housing Agencies and Indian Housing Authorities (HAs) to complete structural
changes to dwelling units, in compliance with the regulation at 24 CFR 8.25(c). This regulation implements Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), with regard to program accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The Act prohibits discrimination against
individuals with disabilities in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. The authority
to grant a time extension is jointly delegated to both the Assistant Secretary for FHEO and the Assistant Secretary
for PIH. This authority is then retained and jointly redelegated to both the Director, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity
Division, and to either the Director, Public Housing Division (in the case of a Public Housing Agency) or the Administrator,
Office of Native American Programs (in the case of an Indian Housing Authority), in the pertinent field offices.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulation at 24 CFR 8.25(c) requires each Public Housing Agency (PHA) and Indian Housing Authority (IHA) (collectively
referred to as HAs) to assess the need for dwelling units within its jurisdictional area which are accessible to individuals
with disabilities. Where the assessment demonstrates a need for additional accessible units, the HA must develop
a transition plan to achieve the necessary structural changes. In accordance with this regulation, each HA is to have
already made such assessment, and developed a transition plan, if required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
24 CFR 8.25(c) provides that each HA must have completed the structural changes necessary to achieve accessibility
as identified in the transition plan no later than July 11, 1992. However, the regulation also provides that an HA may
obtain an extension of time in meeting this deadline under certain circumstances. Section 8.25(c) provides that
the Assistant Secretary for FHEO and the Assistant Secretary for PIH may extend the deadline to as late a date as July
11, 1994 ``on a case-by-case determination that compliance within that period would impose undue financial and administrative
burdens on the operation of the recipient's public housing and multi-family Indian housing program''. This regulation
further provides that the Secretary or the Undersecretary may extend the time period for compliance from July 11,
1994, up until July 11, 1995, in ``extraordinary circumstances''. To facilitate the prompt review of each request,
the Secretary is jointly delegating to the Assistant Secretaries for FHEO and PIH, and the Assistant Secretaries
are jointly redelegating to certain officials in the field, the authority to grant an extension of time in ``extraordinary
circumstances'' for an HA to complete these structural changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Secretary delegates, and the Assistant Secretaries for FHEO and PIH redelegate, authority as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development jointly delegates to both the Assistant Secretary for FHEO and the
Assistant Secretary for PIH, who retain their authority and jointly redelegate to both the Director, Fair Housing
and Equal Opportunity Division, and to either the Director, Public Housing Division (in the case of a PHA) or the Administrator,
Office of Native American Programs (in the case of an IHA), in the pertinent field offices, the power and authority
to grant a time extension in extraordinary circumstances from July 11, 1994, for a period up to one year until July 11,
1995, for an HA to complete structural changes needed (as previously determined pursuant to 24 CFR 8.25(c)) to provide
additional units accessible to individuals with disabilities. Where a particular field office does not have a Fair
Housing and Equal Opportunity Division, the Director, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Division in the field office
which has responsibility for the programs for HAs in that jurisdiction shall have the authority with respect to the
redelegation within this notice.

ABSTRACT: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
When a company enters into a contract to develop, produce, and dispose of gas and associated products from Federal
or Indian lands, that company agrees to pay the United States or Indian Tribe or allottee a share (royalty) of the full
value of production from the leased lands. In order to determine whether the amount of royalty tendered represents
the proper royalty due, it is necessary to establish the value of allowances being deducted from royalty payments.
Allowances are taken for the cost of processing the gas stream to extract associated products, and for the cost of transporting
the gas to the processing plant and to the point of sale. The information collected is necessary to evaluate the reasonableness
of allowances taken and to ensure that proper royalty payments are made.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 29, 1994, Illinois Central Corporation (IC), Illinois Central Railroad Company (ICRR), Kansas City Southern
Industries Inc. (KCSI), and The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (KCSR) (collectively applicants) filed a notice
of intent indicating that IC will file an application seeking Commission approval and authorization under 49 U.S.C.
11343&hyph;47 for: (1) IC's acquisition of control of and merger with KCSI; and (2) the resulting common control of
ICRR and KCSR by IC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this transaction, IC will acquire 100% of the stock of KCSI. The acquisition will occur as part of a transaction in
which (1) KCSI will effect a reorganization in which it distributes complete ownership of its financial services
and information processing operations to the holders of KCSI's common stock; and (2) IC will place its stock in ICRR
into an independent voting trust.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Applicants state that, while awaiting approval of the transaction by the Commission, ICRR and KCSR will be operated
independently. The parties anticipate that the independent voting trust will terminate upon approval of the transaction
by this Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1&sect;On August 16, 1994, IC requested, under 49 CFR 1013.3(a), an informal opinion from the Secretary of the Commission
that the proposed voting trust arrangement will insulate IC from any violation of the Interstate Commerce Act pending
approval of the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants state that, after the reorganization has occurred, IC and KCSI intend to consummate the merger in which
KCSI will be merged with IC and the separate existence of KCSI will cease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants will use the year July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1994, for purposes of the impact analyses to be filed in their application.
Applicants anticipate filing their application on or about November 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that this is a major transaction, as defined at 49 CFR 1180.2(a), as it is a control transaction
involving two or more class I railroads. The application must conform to the regulations set forth at 49 CFR part 1180
and must contain all information required there for major transactions, except as modified by any advance waiver.
Applicants are also required to submit maps with overlays that show the existing routes of both carriers and their
competitors.

By petition filed August 5, 1994, applicants sought approval of a protective order to protect confidential, highly
confidential, and proprietary information, including contract terms, shipper-specific traffic data, and other
traffic data to be submitted in connection with the control application. A protective order was approved in a decision
served August 12, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also on August 5, 1994, applicants filed a petition to establish a procedural schedule. The Commission seeks comments

Under the proposal, immediately upon each evidentiary filing, the filing party will place all documents relevant
to the filing (other than documents that are privileged or otherwise protected from discovery) in a depository open
to all parties, and will make its witnesses available for discovery depositions. Access to documents subject to protective
order will be appropriately restricted. Parties seeking discovery depositions may proceed by agreement. Relevant
excerpts of transcripts will be received in lieu of cross-examination at the hearing, unless cross-examination
is needed to resolve material issues of disputed fact. Discovery on responsive applications will begin immediately
upon their filing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed schedule contains substantially shorter time periods than those provided for in our rules at 49 CFR 1180.4(a)&hyph;(e).
For example, &sect;1180.4(e) tracks the statute at 49 U.S.C. 11345(b)(3) and requires that the evidentiary proceedings
for a major transaction be completed in 24 months after acceptance of the primary application, with a final decision
to be issued within 180 days thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We invite interested persons to submit written comments on the proposed procedural schedule. Comments must be filed
by September 12, 1994. Applicants may reply by September 22, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has found that the public convenience and necessity permit Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail)
to abandon its 76.2-mile Danville Secondary line extending from Schneider, IN (milepost 33.0) to Danville, IL (milepost
109.2), in Lake, Newton, Benton, and Warren Counties, IN and Vermilion County, IL, subject to a condition relating
to the discontinuance of trackage rights over the line by Soo Line Railroad Company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A certificate will be issued authorizing abandonment unless within 15 days after this publication the Commission
also finds that: (1) A financially responsible person has offered financial assistance (through subsidy or purchase)
to enable the rail service to be continued; and (2) it is likely that the assistance would fully compensate the railroad.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any financial assistance offer must be filed with the Commission and served on the applicant no later than 10 days from
publication of this Notice. The following notation must be typed in boldface on the lower left-hand corner of the envelope
containing the offer: ``Office of Proceedings, AB&hyph;OFA.'' Any offer previously made must be remade within this
10-day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information and procedures regarding financial assistance for continued rail service are contained in 49 U.S.C.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the policy of the Department of Justice, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that on July 26, 1994,
a proposed Consent Decree in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States v. IBP inc.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Civil Action No. 94&hyph;4072, was lodged with the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois.
In this action, the United States sought injunctive relief and civil penalties against IBP inc. (``IBP'') pursuant
to Section 309 of the Clean Water Act (``the Act''), 33 U.S.C. 1319, for violations of Section 301 of the Act, and certain
terms and conditions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (``NPDES'') permit for IBP's Joslin,
Illinois facility. In addition, the State of Illinois filed a complaint in intervention, asserting claims against
IBP for violations of the Illinois Protection Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991 Ch. 1111/2 &para; 1009(a), and 35 Ill. Adm.
Code 201.141.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Decree requires IBP to construct an expansion to its current wastewater treatment system to
treat ammonia nitrogen, and the proposed Decree establishes a schedule for achieving compliance with the ammonia
nitrogen effluent limit in IBP's NPDES permit. During construction of the treatment plant expansion, IBP is required
to comply with interim ammonia nitrogen limits specified in the proposed Consent Decree. In all other respects, the
proposed Consent Decree requires IBP to treat and monitor pollutants from its Joslin facility in accordance with
the terms of its NPDES permit and applicable rules relating to wastewater from meat processing and leather tanning
facilities. The proposed Decree also requires IBP to pay a civil penalty of $250,000 to the United States and a separate
$30,000 civil penalty to the State of Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Justice will receive comments relating to the proposed Consent Decree for a period of 30 days from
the date of this publication. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the Environment and
Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530. All comments should refer to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the policy of the Department of Justice, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that on August 5, 1994,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States v. Styrotech Inc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Civil Action No. 4&hyph;92&hyph;912, was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.
This action was brought pursuant to Section 113 of the Clean Air Act (``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 7413, to obtain injunctive
relief and civil penalties for violations of Section 165 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7475, and applicable requirements of
40 CFR 52.21 and the Minnesota State Implementation Plan, at an expanded polystyrene manufacturing facility in Minneapolis,
Minnesota.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Joint Stipulation and Order prohibits Styrotech Inc. (``Styrotech'') from operating its existing
expanded polystyrene manufacturing facility except in compliance with Section 165 of the Act, 40 CFR 52.21, and applicable
provisions of the Minnesota State Implementation Plan. In addition, pending issuance of a final air emission facility
permit for Styrotech's existing facility, the proposed Joint Stipulation and Order requires Styrotech: (1) to comply
with all terms and conditions of draft permit no. 2304&hyph;90&hyph;OT&hyph;1 previously issued by the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency (``MPCA''), and (2) to maintain records concerning specified matters relating to operations

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement; United States of America v. AT&amp;T Corp. and McCaw Cellular
Communications, Inc.</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h), that a proposed
Final Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United District Court for
the District of Columbia in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States of America
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
AT&amp;T Corp. and McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Civil Action No. 94&hyph;01555 (HHG). The proposed Final Judgment is subject to approval by the Court after the expiration
of the statutory 60-day public comment period and compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15
U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint alleges that the propose acquisition by AT&amp;T Corp. (``AT&amp;T'') of McCaw Cellular Communications,
Inc. (``McCaw'') violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, in the markets for cellular service,
cellular infrastructure equipment and interexchange service to cellular subscribers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Final Judgment contains substantive obligations and restrictions that should substantially mitigate
the incentive and ability of the merged AT&amp;T-McCaw to constrain the actions of McCaw's cellular service competitors.
The proposed Final Judgment provides for separate subsidiary requirements and restrictions on the flow of certain
confidential information within the combined AT&amp;T/McCaw entity; obligates AT&amp;T to continue to deal with
its customers on terms in place prior to the merger, and on terms not less favorable than those offered to McCaw; obligates
AT&amp;T to assist, and not to interfere, with an incumbent customer's decision to change infrastructure suppliers;
and requires a buy-back provision that would reduce the lock-in effect by lowering the cost for a competitor/customer
to switch suppliers in the event that AT&amp;T fails to comply with its obligations to its customers under the judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Next, the proposed Final Judgment requires McCaw cellular systems to provide equal access to interexchange competitors
of AT&amp;T, which is not now provided in most McCaw systems, thereby increasing competition in the provision of interexchange
services to cellular customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed Final Judgment restrains McCaw from providing certain confidential information of other
cellular infrastructure equipment suppliers to AT&amp;T's manufacturing division to prevent anticompetitive
harm to the cellular infrastructure equipment market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments, and responses thereto, will
be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Richard Liebeskind, Assistant Chief, Communications and
Finance Section, Room 8104, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW Washington, DC 20001.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is stipulated by and between the undersigned parties, by their respective attorneys, that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The parties consent that a Final Judgment in the form hereto attached may be filed and entered by the Court, upon the
motion of any party or upon the Court's own motion, at any time after compliance with the requirements of the Antitrust
Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16, and without further notice to any party or other proceedings, provided
that plaintiff has not withdrawn its consent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The parties shall abide by and comply with the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment pending entry of the Final
Judgment, unless AT&amp;T or McCaw certify to the Department that this transaction has been abandoned, and withdrew
its applicable filing made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, in which case the
proposed Final Judgment or Final Judgment will be withdrawn or vacated and the action dismissed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Plaintiff may withdraw its consent to this proposed Final Judgment at any time before the entry of the proposed Final
Judgment by serving notice thereof on defendants and by filing that notice with the Court. In the event plaintiff withdraws
its consent or if the proposed Final Judgment is not entered pursuant to this Stipulation, this Stipulation will be
of no effect whatsoever, and the making of this Stipulation shall be without prejudice to any party in this or any other
proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In the event of a final and unappealable order determining that entry of this Final Judgment would be contrary to

calling number identification and other information necessary to bill calls, answer supervision, carrier access
codes, and testing and maintenance of whatever facilities of the cellular system are used by Interexchange Carriers,
regardless of whether any of these services are provided to AT&amp;T. A McCaw Cellular System shall be required to
offer to each unaffiliated Interexchange Carrier to establish dedicated access connections to MTSOs, to perform
billing services on reasonable terms, to provide interexchange traffic routing services, provide customer location
information for use in routing calls, and to perform other activities or functions for Interexchange Carriers in
connection with the origination, routing, or termination interexchange calls in the same manner as and on the same
terms and conditions, including price, that those services, activities, or functions are provided to AT&amp;T.
If a McCaw Cellular System provides information to AT&amp;T to allow it to bill its Interexchange Service customers
for Cellular Service, it shall at each unaffiliated Interchange Carrier's option provide sufficient information
about the usage and charges for Cellular Service to other Interexchange Carriers to allow them to make commercially
reasonable arrangements to bill their customers for Cellular Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Be prohibited from discriminating in favor of AT&amp;T (a) in providing in a timely manner technical or other information

Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 15, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint, under Section 15 of the Clayton Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C. 25, against AT&amp;T and McCaw, alleging that the proposed merger of defendants violates Section 7 of the
Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Decreasing actual and potential competition in the market for cellular services because the merger would combine
McCaw, a cellular service provider with AT&amp;T, the leading supplier of cellular infrastructure equipment. That
vertical integration may substantially increase the merged firm's ability and incentive to raise the costs, limit
the capacity, or constrain the quality of service of McCaw's cellular service competitors that are dependent upon
AT&amp;T for cellular infrastructure equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Decreasing competition in the market for cellular infrastructure equipment by providing AT&amp;T with access
to competitively sensitive and proprietary information of McCaw's principal equipment supplier, L.M. Ericsson
(``Ericsson'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Decreasing actual and potential competition in the market for interexchange services to cellular subscribers,
because the merger of AT&amp;T and McCaw would combine AT&amp;T, the largest interexchange carrier in the United
States with McCaw, one of only two cellular service providers in many markets; and would combine the two largest providers
of interexchange service to cellular service customers in many areas served by McCaw.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AT&amp;T is the dominant supplier of interexchange telecommunications service in the United States, providing
interexchange service to wireline and cellular telephone customers. AT&amp;T is also the largest supplier of the
cellular infrastructure equipment (switches, cell site radios and related equipment) used by cellular carriers
to provide that service in the United States and North America. AT&amp;T, along with the next two largest suppliers_Motorola
and Ericsson_account for the vast majority of the installed base of cellular infrastructure equipment in the United
States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
McCaw is the largest provider of cellular service in the United States, with ownership interests in cellular systems
serving approximately 22 percent of all of the cellular subscribers in the United States. These systems include the
following cities: New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Seattle,
Portland, St. Louis and Kansas City. McCaw owns and operates a number of these systems in partnership with companies
with whom it competes in other service areas. These companies include AirTouch Communications, Inc. (previously
PacTel Mobile Services) and BellSouth Corporation. McCaw operates many of its cellular systems under the name ``Cellular
One,'' a tradename owned by a joint venture among a number of cellular licensees including McCaw and Southwestern
Bell Corp. McCaw also provides interexchange services to customers of its cellular services, primarily over AT&amp;T
facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to an agreement dated August 16, 1993, AT&amp;T agreed to purchase McCaw. On July 15, 1994, the United States
and defendants filed a stipulation by which they consented to entry of a proposed Final Judgment, after compliance
with the APPA, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h), designed to eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger
in each of the affected markets. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate this action, except that the Court
will retain jurisdiction to construe, modify and enforce the Final Judgment, and to punish violations of the Final
Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained more fully below, the proposed Final Judgment would substantially mitigate the incentive and ability
of the merged AT&amp;T-McCaw to constrain the actions of McCaw's cellular service competitors, by providing mechanisms
to insure that AT&amp;T could not use its position as the incumbent supplier to those McCaw competitors that are locked
in to AT&amp;T's equipment to disadvantage or discriminate against them in favor of McCaw. These mechanisms include:
separate subsidiary requirements and restrictions on the flow of certain confidential information within the combined
AT&amp;T/McCaw entity; obligations on AT&amp;T to continue to deal with its customers on terms in place prior to the
merger, and on terms not less favorable than those offered to McCaw; obligations to assist and not interfere with an
incumbent customer's changing infrastructure suppliers; and a buy-back obligation that would reduce the lock-in
effect by lowering the cost for a competitor/customer to switch suppliers in the event that AT&amp;T fails to comply
with its obligations to its customers under the judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address concerns in the interexchange markets, the proposed Final Judgment would require McCaw cellular systems
to provide equal access to interexchange competitors of AT&amp;T, which is not now provided in most McCaw systems,
thereby increasing competition in the provision of interexchange services to cellular customers.

1. Cellular Services Markets
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cellular carriers operate on either of two bands of radio frequencies, referred to as the ``A-side'' and the ``B-side.''
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The FCC awarded one A-side and one B-side license separately in 306 metropolitan areas, referred to as MSAs, and 428
rural areas called RSAs. Initially, the FCC awarded the B-side license to the local telephone company or an affiliate
thereof and the A-side license to firms other than the local telephone company.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Cellular licenses are transferable, and since the initial awards there has been considerable consolidation of ownership.
Telephone companies have acquired many A-side licenses outside of the areas in which they provide local exchange
service. Cellular service is fully interconnected with landline telephone networks, and subscribers can both originate
calls to and receive calls from landline subscribers, including long distance calls.

Cellular licenses held by AT&amp;T or the Bell Companies, at the time of AT&amp;T's divestiture of those Bell Companies
in 1984, were retained by the Bell Companies and are now generally held by affiliates of their respective parent Regional
Holding Companies.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cellular service is a relevant product market and a ``line of commerce'' within the meaning of Section 7 of the Clayton
Act. Unlike conventional landline telephone service, cellular service provides customers with the added feature
of mobility, and landline telephone service therefore is not a substitute. The relevant geographic markets are those
service areas in which the FCC has licensed cellular carriers to provide cellular service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With extremely limited exceptions, there are no providers of mobile telephone services other than the two cellular
carriers. At the current time, the holders of these cellular licenses, including McCaw, exercise market power in
the provision of cellular service. These duopolies are characterized by rapidly growing demand and minimal price
competition, resulting in high margins to cellular carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Cellular Infrastructure Equipment Market
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A cellular system consists primarily of one or more mobile telephone switching offices (``MTSOs'' or ``switches'')
connected to numerous cell sites. A cell site is a radio facility that receives and transmits cellular calls. Cellular
carriers provide cellular service by dividing their licensed service areas into ``cells''_each with a corresponding
cell site_and reusing the radio channels in different cells. The principal components of a cell site are radio units,
radio frames and software (referred to collectively as ``radio base stations'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A switch is a large central computer facility connected to cell sites, other MTSOs and local and long distance telephone
networks. The MTSO controls the ``handoff'' of calls between the cells and transfers calls between the cellular systems
and the wireline networks of local exchange carriers and interexchange carriers. A cellular system in a large metropolitan
area like New York City or Baltimore/Washington might typically include two to four switches and more than one hundred
radio base stations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One principal method of expanding the capacity of a cellular system is to increase the number of cells. The creation
of these new cells requires the purchase and deployment of an additional radio base station for each new cell. At some
point in expanding the capacity of a system it also becomes necessary to add additional switches. Another method of
capacity expansion currently being used is to convert the radio transmissions from analog to digital. This conversion
requires the deployment of new radios and cell site equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In North America, cellular switches made by one manufacturer are not compatible with radio base stations made by another.
Accordingly, a cellular carrier seeking to expand the capacity of a particular system must obtain additional switches
and radio base stations from its incumbent cellular infrastructure equipment supplier. Digital conversion requires
the deployment of switch and cell site equipment and software that is noncompatible between manufacturers. Enhancements
that add customer features or improve a system's capacity or efficiency are added to systems primarily through switch
or cell site software upgrades. Because the interfaces between the cellular infrastructure equipment and software
are proprietary, the equipment vendor is, today, the only one who can provide these enhancements. In addition, cellular
carriers are largely dependent on their equipment vendors for ongoing engineering support and maintenance, as well
as efficiency and service enhancing features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, once a cellular carrier has made the decision to deploy a particular vendor's cellular infrastructure equipment
in a particular system, that carrier becomes locked in to that vendor's equipment and must either continue to purchase
equipment and software from that same vendor or incur the substantial costs of replacing the deployed switches and
radio base stations of the incumbent vendor. As cellular systems grow, so also does the cost of switching vendors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equipment providers typically have access to proprietary and competitively sensitive information of their cellular
carrier customers. Some of this information is acquired in the performance of installation, maintenance and other
services provided by the manufacturers to the cellular carriers. For example, through its access to a cellular carrier's
switch, a manufacturer has access to day-to-day operating information about the switch, including usage patterns.
Manufacturers must also receive advance notice of planned system expansions so that they may allocate equipment
and other resources to that customer. Manufacturers also work closely with their customers in the development of
new services and features, sometimes on a proprietary basis, This development work necessarily provides the manufacturer
with insights into, and advance notice of, its cellular carrier customer's marketing and sales plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cellular infrastructure equipment is a relevant product market. Cellular infrastructure equipment manufactured
for use in North America is based on a different standard than equipment manufactured for use by European cellular
providers. Accordingly, equipment used in North America is not compatible with equipment manufactured for use in
Europe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many of the cities in which McCaw has an interest in the A-side cellular system, the B-side competitor has deployed
and is operating its system using AT&amp;T cellular infrastructure equipment. Major markets in which McCaw competes
with AT&amp;T customers include, among others, New York, Dallas, San Francisco, Miami, St. Louis, Tampa, Orlando,
Salt Lake City, Kansas City and Pittsburgh. McCaw uses Ericsson equipment in the majority of its systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AT&amp;T currently has the ability to raise the costs, inhibit the ability to increase system capacity and capabilities
and degrade the quality of service of its locked in B-side equipment customers. AT&amp;T could achieve this by increasing
the prices of its equipment and software or by withholding or delaying the development or delivery of necessary equipment,
software, services or other upgrades.

3. Harm to Competition Arising from the Combination of McCaw's Cellular Services and AT&amp;T's Cellular Infrastructure
Equipment Business
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed merger may substantially lessen competition in cellular services markets. Although AT&amp;T already
has the ability to disadvantage its cellular infrastructure customers, today AT&amp;T has no strong incentive to
disadvantage one cellular carrier customer vis-a-vis another, because AT&amp;T is not providing local cellular
service. As a result of this merger, however, AT&amp;T would gain the incentive to harm McCaw's competitors that use
AT&amp;T cellular equipment, to McCaw's advantage, by exploiting AT&amp;T's control over the costs, capabilities
and capacity to those locked-in equipment customers. Thus, the combined AT&amp;T-McCaw would have the incentive
and the ability to either raise its cellular service rivals' costs or, through the threat of doing so, reduce its rivals'
incentive to compete. In either event the likely outcome is increased prices and lower quality service to consumers
of cellular service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The merger also will give McCaw access to competitively sensitive and proprietary information of McCaw's competitors
that AT&amp;T acquires through its role as cellular infrastructure equipment supplier to Macaw's competitors.
As described above, this information relates to planned expansions, new service offerings and other efficiency
enhancing upgrades. McCaw's competitors could well decide to forgo or limit their expenditures of resources in these
areas if they believe that they will not enjoy the competitive benefit of such expenditures because McCaw will have
immediate access to their competitive plans. As a result, consumers of cellular service are likely to pay higher prices
and receive lower quality service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed merger may also harm competition in the sale of cellular infrastructure equipment used by North American
cellular service providers, by giving AT&amp;T access to competitively sensitive or proprietary information of
Ericsson that McCaw acquires through its position as a customer for and user of Ericsson cellular infrastructure
equipment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Harm to Competition Arising from the Combination of McCaw's Cellular Services Business and AT&amp;T's Interexchange
Business
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interexchange services are telecommunications services that connect calls between different local exchange areas
or local cellular service areas. AT&amp;T is the dominant interexchange carrier for both wired and cellular telephone
service, with MCI and Sprint and a number of smaller firms having much smaller shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision of interexchange services to cellular subscribers is a relevant product market. Customers use cellular
phones to meet their needs away from landline telephones; access to interexchange service over landline telephones
is inconsistent with the needs motivating cellular phone usage and thus is not a good substitute. Cellular subscribers
can only access interexchange service providers that have exchange access to that cellular system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the lack of effective competition in the cellular service markets, McCaw has been able to deny its cellular customers
the ability to select their interexchange service provider. In those markets in which McCaw's systems are not controlled
by a Bell Company that is subject to equal access requirements,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 McCaw provides interexchange service to its cellular customers on an exclusive basis (typically reselling AT&amp;T
service), and does not generally allow its customers to access other interexchange carriers directly. In systems
operated by Bell Companies subject to equal access requirements, interexchange service is provided by the interexchange
carrier of the customer's choice. Thus, customers may choose between McCaw's A-side bundle of local and interexchange
services or the B-side carrier's local cellular service and, where the B-side carrier is a Bell Company subject to
equal access, the interexchange service offered by the customer's interexchange carrier of choice. (Where the B-side
carrier is not a Bell Company, the customer's choice is between two bundles of local cellular and long distance service.)

The relevant geographic markets are cellular service areas in which McCaw offers bundled cellular and interexchange
services. These areas include New York, Miami, Tampa, Minneapolis, Seattle, Pittsburgh, New Orleans, Portland
and Sacramento. Each of these markets is highly concentrated. Among Bell Company cellular systems providing equal
access, AT&amp;T is the dominant interexchange carrier, with more than 70 percent of subscribers, with MCI and Sprint
sharing nearly all of the remainder.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>

The merger may lessen competition substantially in the markets for the provision of interexchange service to cellular
subscribers. The merger would foreclose competition between the two largest providers of interexchange service
in the highly concentrated markets in which McCaw currently provides interexchange service to its cellular customers
without an equal access obligation. The merger also combines AT&amp;T, the leading provider of interexchange service,
with McCaw, which has market power over the provision of interexchange service by virtue of the fact that it controls
access by its cellular customers to interexchange services. As a result, competition in the provision of interexchange
service to cellular customers in these areas may be substantially lessened and cellular subscribers may pay higher
prices for interexchange service.

Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed Final Judgment addresses the competitive concerns raised by the proposed merger and AT&amp;T and McCaw
in two principal ways. First, to guard against harm to competition in interexchange telecommunications, it requires
AT&amp;T to provide all interexchange carriers with equal access to McCaw cellular systems. Second, the proposed
Final Judgment contains a group of provisions intended to ameliorate the lock-in faced by AT&amp;T cellular infrastructure
equipment customers, which should make it substantially less likely that AT&amp;T can raise the costs of its rivals
in wireless service (or threaten to do so), and therefore guard against anticompetitive effects in wireless service
markets. Finally, the proposed Final Judgment contains restrictions intended to protect against anticompetitive
effects in the cellular infrastructure equipment market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described above, McCaw currently does not provide equal access to interexchange carriers from its cellular systems.
Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment will change these arrangements by requiring McCaw to offer all interexchange
carriers equal access to all of its cellular systems, permitting its customers to choose among interexchange carriers.
The need for these provisions is predicated on the noncompetitive structure of current cellular service markets
and the market power currently possessed by McCaw and other providers of cellular exchange service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section IV.B provides for the phased-in conversion of McCaw Cellular Systems to equal access over a 21-month period
after the commencement of this action, pursuant to a plan to be approved by the United States according to Section VII.A
of the judgment. ``McCaw Cellular Systems'' are defined in Section II.T to include systems in which McCaw holds voting
interests greater than 50 percent or in which it has the right, power or ability to control. ``Control'' is defined
in Section II.K as the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a corporation or partnership,
whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. McCaw would not, under this definition,
be considered to control a corporation or partnership in which another entity held a significantly larger ownership
interest unless McCaw had expressly been given the right to control, such as through voting rights or by contract.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section IV.A provides that, prior to its conversion to equal access, no McCaw Cellular System may alter its arrangements
for the provision of interexchange service in ways that discriminate in favor of AT&amp;T in the provision of exchange
access. Pursuant to Section III.E, a McCaw Cellular System or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System may use the name
``AT&amp;T'' or any trademark or trade name of AT&amp;T in its corporate or service names only after it has completed
conversion to equal access and balloted existing customers pursuant to Sections IV.B and IV.C. In addition, neither
AT&amp;T, McCaw nor McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems may use the name AT&amp;T or any trademark or trade name
of AT&amp;T in marketing or advertising cellular service until 60% of the McCaw Cellular Systems, measured by subscribers
(and not including Bell Company cellular systems that provide equal access pursuant to the MFJ) have completed conversion
to equal access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections IV.B, IV.C and IV.D of the judgment prescribe the basic requirements of equal access. Section IV.B.1 requires
each McCaw Cellular System to provide local cellular service under prices and terms that do not depend upon the customer
obtaining interexchange service from AT&amp;T or a McCaw affiliate, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on an unbundled basis. Moreover, McCaw, McCaw Cellular Systems and their employees and agents (including AT&amp;T
when it acts as agent for a McCaw Cellular System pursuant to Section IV.F of the judgment) may not recommend, sell or
otherwise market the interexchange service of any interexchange carriers, and are required to administer interexchange
carrier selection procedures on a carrier-neutral and nondiscriminatory basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV.B also requires McCaw to ballot its existing customers to permit them to choose an interexchange carrier
to which all of the customer's originating interexchange communications will be routed automatically, without
the use of any access codes (i.e., on a 1+basis), as well as to permit the customer to access other interexchange carriers
by dialing the appropriate carrier identification code (i.e., on a 10&hyph;XXX basis). Balloting will occur within
60 days of each McCaw Cellular System's conversion to equal access. If, in the balloting process, any McCaw customer
fails to choose an interexchange carrier, those customers may be allocated to interexchange carriers in proportion
to the number of customers subscribing to each carrier.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Thereafter, interexchange services will be blocked to any new customer that fails to choose a carrier and attempts
to place calls without access codes.

The specific balloting process will be described in the equal access plans filed by defendants under Section VII.A

To permit all interexchange carriers to have a meaningful opportunity to market their services to customers of McCaw
Cellular Systems, those systems will be required to provide interexchange carriers with the names and addresses
of their existing customers at least 60 days prior to conversion to equal access, and at quarterly intervals thereafter.
Similarly, under Section IV.C, any customer information provided to AT&amp;T by a McCaw Cellular System must be provided
to other interexchange carriers at the same time and under the same terms. A McCaw Cellular System may not provide AT&amp;T
with information about a customer's interexchange carrier or cellular or interexchange usage unless the customer
is already a customer of AT&amp;T's interexchange service and unless it provides the same information at the same
time to other interexchange carriers concerning their own customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The post-conversion equal access requirements contained in Section IV.D largely parallel the analogous requirements
of the MFJ including requirements that each McCaw Cellular System provide interexchange carriers exchange access
on an unbundled basis equal in type, quality and price to that provided to AT&amp;T.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That section also provides that if a McCaw Cellular System provides information to AT&amp;T to allow AT&amp;T to bill
its interexchange customers for cellular service (subject to the restrictions of Section IV.F), it must at the option
of any other interexchange carrier provide that carrier with sufficient information about the usage and charges
for cellular service to allow it to make commercially reasonable arrangements to bill its interexchange customers
for cellular service. The last sentence of Section IV.D.1 does not impose any additional obligation on AT&amp;T or
McCaw to bill for other interexchange carriers, but does require them to provide competing carriers with sufficient
information so that they can make commercially reasonable arrangements to perform billing themselves or have billing
done by third parties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basis for this requirement is the concern that AT&amp;T's acquisition of McCaw could put it in the position of being
the only interexchange carrier with the ability to offer prospective customers of wireless interexchange service
the option of receiving a single bill for both cellular and interexchange services. Given AT&amp;T's already dominant
position in this segment of the interexchange market, this added advantage could be sufficient to further increase
AT&amp;T's ability to increase prices or exclude interexchange competitors by virtue of its control of a cellular
duopolist. The language used in Section IV.D.1 was adopted in preference to a simple nondiscrimination requirement
out of a concern that, given its position as a possibly major provider of billing services to McCaw, arrangements that
could be workable for AT&amp;T could be totally uneconomic for other interexchange carriers. Thus, it might not be
practical for smaller interexchange carriers to perform all of the rating and processing of local cellular calls
if they only provide interexchange service to a relatively small number of McCaw customers. The chosen language was
intended to assure that sufficiently refined billing information was provided to such interexchange carriers that
they could readily incorporate it with their interexchange bills with a minimum of additional processing and programming
required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV.F. permits AT&amp;T to act as McCaw's agent in marketing local cellular services and in jointly marketing
local cellular, interexchange and other services on specified conditions. These conditions, which basically track
those the United States has recommended for the Bell Companies if they should be permitted to provide wireless interexchange
service, are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
first,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 if AT&amp;T engages in marketing local cellular service for McCaw, it must advise actual or prospective subscribers
of their right to resubscribe to the interexchange carrier of their choice; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
second,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AT&amp;T must state the price, terms and rate plans for local cellular and interexchange service separately, meaning
that it cannot sell bundled offerings of local cellular and interexchange service; and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
third,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AT&amp;T is enjoined from selling interexchange service at a price, term or discount that depends on whether the customer
obtains local cellular service from McCaw, and McCaw and McCaw Cellular Systems are enjoined from selling local cellular
service at a price, term or discount that depends on whether the customer obtains interexchange service from AT&amp;T.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, AT&amp;T may, without separately stating the charges for interexchange
service and terminating local cellular service, offer a ``calling party pays'' service for calls made to a cellular
telephone. Ordinarily, the cellular subscriber receiving the calls pays for the cellular airtime. Section IV.E.2
would permit AT&amp;T to charge a single price for the interexchange portion of such a call and the terminating airtime
(paid by the caller, not the called party), under the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AT&amp;T must obtain the underlying local cellular service used to terminate the call at a generally available rate
which, to prevent against artificially high transfer prices,is no higher than the rate offered to resellers of local
cellular service; and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
second,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 this rate must be disclosed to other interexchange carriers and be described in the Equal Access plan to be filed for
approval by the United States. These conditions will allow a potentially useful new service to be provided while assuring
that AT&amp;T's competitors will have a fair opportunity to compete with AT&amp;T in providing this service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV.G provides that if the United States certifies, upon a showing by AT&amp;T, that there is insufficient
demand by interexchange carriers for access to McCaw Cellular systems within any Local Cellular Service Area, McCaw
Cellular Systems may provide new services in which access is provided to interexchange carriers at centralized points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV.H permits McCaw to hand off cellular digital packet data transmissions (as specified in Section II.F)
to interexchange carriers at centralized points. The United States understands that the transport cost for packetized
data, especially that using the Internet Protocol, is small in comparison to other elements of the service, and, thus,
this service could be economically justified more easily (in more locations) if providers did not need to implement
switching or routing points in each local Cellular Service Area. In addition, since transport across the Internet
does not involve distance-sensitive charges, it will not make any difference to users where their messages are transfered
onto the Internet. Finally, the Internet protocol does not have any position for indicating a customer's choice of
access provider and thus it would make use of the CDPD service less convenient and probably more expensive for such
users if they were required to include addressing for separate access providers in addition to the customary Internet
address normally employed by such users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cellular systems in which McCaw has voting interest of fifty percent or less and does not have the right, power or ability
to control are defined in Section II.U as ``McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems.'' These systems are not subject
to most of the equal access requirements of Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment, but are subject to the non-bundling
requirements of Section IV.F.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Section IV.E provides that if AT&amp;T or McCaw obtains control of a cellular system after entry of the proposed Final
Judgment, it will be converted to equal access within one year (or within 21 months after the commencement of this action,
whichever is later).

Some of the cellular systems in which McCaw has an interest are deemed ``Bell Companies'' under the MFJ and are subject
to the MFJ's equal access requirements. The United States has proposed an order to the MFJ Court that would impose certain
requirements in order to protect the provision of equal access by those systems. Whether these systems are also McCaw
Cellular Systems, or are McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems, depends on whether McCaw (as well as the Bell Company)
controls the system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The equal access obligations imposed by the proposed Final Judgment apply to interexchange services, i.e., services
that extend beyond the boundaries of a Local Cellular Service Area. Section II.Q of the judgment defines those areas
as the areas in which the Bell Companies are permitted under the MFJ, including any orders entered under it or any legislation
that supersedes or modifies it, to provide cellular exchange service without an equal access obligation. The majority
of McCaw Cellular Systems are configured to provide cellular exchange services in areas that would be permissible
for the Bell Companies under the MFJ and waiver orders entered under it. There are, however, 19 McCaw Cellular Systems
whose local service areas extend beyond the bounds that would be permitted for a Bell Company. Section II.Q allows
``grandfathered'' exceptions to the general definition of Local Cellular Service Areas for those systems. As the
stipulation expressly notes, by permitting these exceptions, the United States has not concluded that these areas
are appropriate local calling areas for cellular service, but agreed to these exceptions for the present time, subject
to further order of the Court, for the following reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, McCaw has a single switch (or several interconnected switches) located in one LATA but connected to
some cell sites located outside the LATA. In many of these cases, either no Bell Company is licensed to serve the area
in competition with McCaw, or a Bell Company is licensed to serve only part of the area and thus could not feasibly offer
service throughout the same area even apart from MFJ constraints.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC currently has under way a proceeding considering whether to impose equal access requirements on all cellular
or commercial mobile radio service providers, in which the appropriate scope of local calling areas is an issue. In
light of these developments, the United States determined not to require McCaw to reconfigure its existing systems
until other proceedings addressing the appropriate scope of local cellular calling areas are concluded. If those
proceedings result in determinations that are inconsistent with the exceptions in Section II.Q, or if it otherwise
appears that any exceptions are not justified, the United States has reserved the right to seek orders from the Court
eliminating any such exceptions. In such a proceeding, AT&amp;T might contend that such exceptions are consistent
with prior practice under the MFJ or are otherwise appropriate.

<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 customers who rely on AT&amp;T equipment and are locked in to AT&amp;T. Section V of the proposed Final Judgment contains
several provisions designed to restrict AT&amp;T's ability and incentive to use its position as equipment supplier
to McCaw's wireless competitors to disadvantage those customers/competitors vis-a-vis McCaw.

Because AT&amp;T is not only a leading supplier of cellular infrastructure equipment, but is also developing and
selling infrastructure equipment for other wireless services that are being developed and that may compete with
cellular service in the future, many of the provisions of Section V apply to ``wireless services'' and the infrastructure
equipment used to provide those services. ``Wireless Service'' is defined in Section II.AF to include not just cellular
service, but those telecommunications services that use radio transmission between the customer and the network,
including cellular, land mobile radio, commercial mobile radio, specialized mobile radio, personal communications
services, and any other mobile radio services that have been or might be authorized by the FCC or offered using radio
transmission between the customer and the network.

The duties of Section V apply only so long as McCaw is affiliated with an AT&amp;T business unit that manufactures cellular
or other wireless infrastructure equipment, as will occur once the merger is consummated. If AT&amp;T, at a point
prior to expiration of the decree, were to divest control of either McCaw or its wireless infrastructure equipment
manufacturing business, the provisions of Section V would no longer be in effect, except for any buy-back liability
under Section V.E accruing as a result of decree violations during the period of affiliation.

1. Misuse of Nonpublic Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section V.A seeks to prevent the potential for harm to competition that might arise as a result of (1) AT&amp;T gaining
access to nonpublic information of a competitor that is a supplier to McCaw or (2) McCaw gaining access to nonpublic
information of a competitor that is a customer of AT&amp;T. The details of procedures adopted by AT&amp;T and McCaw
to implement the provisions of Section V.A will be set forth in Nonpublic Information and Structural Separation implementation
plans to be filed for approval by the United States pursuant to Section VII.A. of the judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As one safeguard against improper disclosure of confidential information, Section V.A.4.a requires AT&amp;T to
establish separate Marketing Account Teams to serve (1) McCaw and other AT&amp;T affiliates and (2) unaffiliated
wireless infrastructure equipment customers. These Marketing Account Teams, as specified in Section II.R, will
be responsible for selling and related services in connection with selling telecommunications equipment, including
customer relationship management, sales, pricing, presentation of bids, basic technical and engineering advice,
order processing and management, and project management. The United States understands that most of the interaction
the AT&amp;T Network Wireless Infrastructure Equipment Unit will have with customers will be by the Marketing Account
Teams. The responsibilities of Marketing Account Teams will be specified in the Structural Separation implementation
plan. In order to assure effective separation, that plan will provide procedures to prevent the disclosure of nonpublic
information in the event that members of Marketing Account Teams serving Unaffiliated Wireless Infrastructure
Equipment Customers (defined in Section II.AC as customers that are neither affiliates of AT&amp;T or McCaw nor McCaw
Minority Owned Cellular Systems) are assigned to any AT&amp;T or McCaw business that either provides telecommunications
equipment to AT&amp;T, McCaw or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System, or that provides or plans for any AT&amp;T
or McCaw wireless service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section V.A.4.b takes steps to assure that nonpublic information of Unaffiliated Wireless Infrastructure equipment
customers is not misused by AT&amp;T as a result of any proprietary development work it performs for equipment customers.
Section II.Y defines Proprietary Development as the development of products, features or functions for cellular
infrastructure equipment that is not intended to be made available to more than one customer or its affiliates. Section
V.A.4.b contemplates the formation of Development Teams to conduct Proprietary Development, and requires AT&amp;T
develop procedures to prevent the disclosure of nonpublic information in the event that members of Development Teams
that do such Proprietary Development for unaffiliated customers perform Proprietary Development for McCaw or for
any AT&amp;T telecommunications service. The principal goal of this provision is to assure that AT&amp;T Development
Teams that obtain nonpublic information about the business, plans or technology of an unaffiliated equipment customer
in the course of performing Proprietary Development work for that customer do not use that information to the benefit
of the telecommunications businesses of AT&amp;T or McCaw.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of Section V.A are intended to prevent the inappropriate disclosure and use of Nonpublic Information
obtained by AT&amp;T or McCaw from unaffiliated equipment customers or suppliers. Section II.X contains a definition
of Nonpublic Information. That definition identifies or includes various categories of information which, if inappropriately
disclosed or used, could cause competitive harm. The most sensitive categories of such information are specified
in Section II.X.2(a). Information enumerated in that subsection may not be disclosed even with the consent of the
supplier of the information.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 An unaffiliated customer or supplier may designate in writing as proprietary other documentary information (or,
in the case of oral, visual or other information, contemporaneously with the disclosure), and such information will
be treated as Nonpublic Information. Information that was provided to AT&amp;T or McCaw prior to entry of the proposed
Final Judgment may be designated as such by the supplier of the information within 180 days after entry of the judgment,
in which case it will be subject to the same protections as other Nonpublic Information. The definition of Nonpublic
Information in Section II.X excludes various categories of information obtained by AT&amp;T by means other than
a breach of duty to its customers, as well as information that is over six years old. In addition, an unaffiliated customer
or supplier may waive any or all of the protections against the disclosure of Nonpublic Information, except for the
categories specified in Section II.X.2(a). This exception is intended to guard against the use of such information
for coordination among competitors.

Likewise, AT&amp;T is barred by Section V.A.1.b from disclosing any Nonpublic Information relating to the provision
of any wireless service by McCaw or AT&amp;T that it obtains by reason of being an equipment supplier to McCaw to any
unaffiliated equipment customer. Under Section V.A.1.c, if certain senior officers of AT&amp;T obtain any such

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section V.B of the proposed final judgment contains provisions designed to prevent AT&amp;T from raising the costs
of McCaw's competitors in connection with the provision of such products and services. Since locked-in equipment
customers are dependent on AT&amp;T for a variety of critical ongoing support functions and products, Section V.B.1
requires AT&amp;T to provide its unaffiliated cellular infrastructure equipment customers with the following
products and services, in accordance with the same pricing and business practices that prevailed prior to August
1, 1993: (a) Technical support and maintenance; (b) installation, engineering, repair and maintenance services;
(c) additional switching and cell site equipment to be deployed in that system; (d) upgrades and other AT&amp;T cellular
infrastructure equipment developed for use with these systems; and (e) spare, repair or replacement parts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision is intended to assure that AT&amp;T will deal with its unaffiliated equipment customers in the same
manner as it did prior to announcement of the proposed merger with McCaw,
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 and that such customers will continue to obtain the products and services they need to provide cellular service, including
software upgrades and switching and cell site equipment needed to expand the capacity of their systems. AT&amp;T
also may not discriminate in favor of McCaw Cellular Systems or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems in the way in
which such products or services are made available to cellular systems, and the terms on which such products or services
are provided shall not vary depending on whether the system to which they will be provided competes with McCaw or a McCaw
Minority Owned Cellular System.

Finally, if AT&amp;T discontinues the offering of any cellular infrastructure equipment service, part or product,
it shall either arrange an alternative source of supply for the product or, if unsuccessful, provide any affected
cellular carrier with the licenses to use (and rights to sublicense) whatever technical information is necessary
to provide such services, parts or products (to the extent AT&amp;T is able to do so), so that the carrier can obtain
the service, part or product from another source. Such licenses shall be granted on reasonable and nondiscriminatory
terms.

3. Development of New Features and Functions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section V.C contains provisions designed to prevent AT&amp;T from disadvantaging its locked-in customers that
compete with McCaw with respect to development of new features and functions, including Proprietary Development
(defined in Section II.Y). Under Section V.C.1, whenever AT&amp;T engages in development of new features or functions
for use with AT&amp;T equipped cellular systems that, if successful, will be made available to two or more cellular
carriers that are not affiliated with each other (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, developments that are not intended for a single customer), AT&amp;T shall disclose such enhancements to unaffiliated
carriers at the same time it discloses them to McCaw or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems, and shall make them available
to unaffiliated customers at the same time it makes them available to McCaw or any McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System.
This section is triggered only by development of features pertaining to systems installed or contracted for prior
to the date of entry of the judgment, as it is specifically intended to address a concern relating to existing locked-in
customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remainder of Section V.C addresses AT&amp;T's obligations in the event it performs development work specifically
for McCaw, a McCaw Cellular System or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System. AT&amp;T has advised the United States
that, at present, AT&amp;T occasionally develops features or functions that are applicable only to a particular
cellular carrier or system because of its adjunct hardware or software or its specific operations or network. If AT&amp;T
engages in such development for McCaw, a McCaw Cellular System or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System, AT&amp;T
must afford unaffiliated customers substantially the same opportunity to contract for such development work on
substantially the same compensatory basis. If AT&amp;T performs other Proprietary Development for McCaw, a McCaw
Cellular System or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System, it will be required upon reasonable request to perform
Proprietary Development for unaffiliated customers under reasonable terms and conditions that are not less favorable
to the unaffiliated customer than those provided to McCaw, McCaw Cellular Systems or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular
Systems. Under Section V.C.3, if AT&amp;T performs Proprietary Development for McCaw (or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular
Systems) it must honor any reasonable request by an unaffiliated carrier to perform such development for it, but AT&amp;T
is entitled to reasonable compensation and other terms so long as those terms are not less favorable than the terms
offered to McCaw or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to further reduce AT&amp;T's ability to exploit its locked-in equipment customers that compete with McCaw,
Section V.D contains provisions that should make it easier for customers that desire to replace AT&amp;T equipment
to do so. In the event that a customer has deployed or contracted to deploy an AT&amp;T equipped cellular system prior
to the entry of the judgment, and the customer wishes to redeploy the AT&amp;T equipment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to facilitate its replacement) or to replace or supplement it with another manufacturer's equipment in whole or
in part, AT&amp;T is required to provide reasonably necessary technical assistance and cooperation to allow the
customer to accomplish such replacement or redeployment and to permit interoperation of the AT&amp;T equipment
with the new manufacturer's equipment in that area or an adjacent area (as in an overlay or core swap-out). AT&amp;T
is permitted to receive reasonable compensation for providing such assistance, and is not required to provide its
equipment competitors with proprietary information that is not necessary to allow the interoperation of their equipment
with AT&amp;T's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, to give AT&amp;T cellular infrastructure equipment customers greater freedom to redeploy AT&amp;T
equipment to a new location or sell it, and to make it easier for customers wishing to do so to change equipment suppliers,
Section V.D.2 requires AT&amp;T to waive contractual requirements that it receive prior notice of or consent to redeployment.
It also provides that, in the event of redeployment or sale, the original warranty, license and other contractual
rights will survive and pass to the transferee, as will AT&amp;T's obligations under Sections V.A, V.B, V.C and V.D
of the judgment. AT&amp;T's buy-back obligations under Section V.E will not, however, pass to a new purchaser of the
equipment, inasmuch as that remedy is especially designed to guard against raising the costs of the locked-in equipment
customers that compete with McCaw.

5. Buy-Back
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The detailed requirements of Sections V.A through V.D of the proposed Final Judgment are intended to mitigate the
effects of lock-in insofar as they make it possible for AT&amp;T to raise the costs of McCaw's rivals, and otherwise
adversely affect competition in cellular or wireless service or infrastructure equipment markets. To provide additional
assurance that AT&amp;T will abide by these requirements, Section V.E provides that AT&amp;T may be required to buy
back the cellular infrastructure equipment it has sold to an unaffiliated customer that competes with McCaw if it
violates any of its duties under Sections V.A through V.D.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The buy-back obligation will be triggered if the United States determines that AT&amp;T has violated any of its duties
under Sections V.A. through V.D to an unaffiliated cellular carrier in any area(a) where that carrier competes with
McCaw or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System and (b) where the unaffiliated cellular carrier has deployed or contract
to deploy an AT&amp;T equipped cellular system prior to entry of the judgment. Thus, if a carrier currently uses AT&amp;T
equipment in a market where it competes with McCaw, and AT&amp;T were to fail to provide software upgrades to that carrier's
system in that market in violation of Section V.B, the buy-back obligation of Section V.E might be triggered. If, however,
AT&amp;T failed to provide software upgrades to that carrier's system in a market in which that carrier did not compete
with McCaw or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System, the buy-back obligation would not be triggered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If AT&amp;T is required by the United States to buy equipment back from an unaffiliated customer, the price shall be
the original purchase price of the equipment purchased or contract for by the carrier for use in that system prior to
entry of the judgment, less depreciation as calculated on a straight-line basis over a period of ten years for switches
and eight years for all other hardware. These periods were selected as generally consistent with what the United States
understood to be the useful lives of such equipment. AT&amp;T shall also refund the proportionate share of all monies
paid for unused portions of software licenses, and shall release the customer from future obligations relating to
cellular infrastructure equipment deployed in that system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to assure that buy-back is meaningfully available to customers in a reasonably timely manner, Section V.D
gives the United States the sole and unreviewable discretion to determine whether that AT&amp;T has violated any
of its duties under Sections V.A through V.D of the judgment. An expeditious determination of whether buy-back has
been triggered is necessary if the locked-in customer is to decide whether to replace a system, and subjecting that
determination to litigation delays would make the buy-back remedy ineffectual. AT&amp;T has irrevocably waived
any right to appeal, contest or otherwise challenge the determination of the United States. It is not intended that
this section create any private rights on behalf of any AT&amp;T customer, nor that any such customer have any right
to appeal, contest or otherwise challenge any determination by the United States pursuant to Section V.E, inasmuch
as the purpose of the section is to aid in the enforcement of ad secure compliance with Sections V.A through V.D of the
judgment. It is the intention of Section V.E that buy-back be a remedy to ensure compliance with the proposed Final
Judgment, and that in determining whether to impose the requirement the United States will consider the seriousness
of the violation, its effect on competition, whether it is part of a pattern of noncompliance, and any other relevant
factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section V.E also permits the United States, in its sole discretion, to appoint an independent fact-finder to conduct
the investigation or factual determination of any issue raised in connection with any alleged violation, reserving
to the United States the right to make a final determination. In the event of such an appointment, the losing party (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the customer or AT&amp;T) shall pay all costs and fees of the fact-finder. The United States will not undertake proceedings
to determine whether buy-back should be required except on the application of and with the consent of the affected
customer, including consent to the payment of costs and fees.

1. Separation Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To help give effect to the equal access and manufacturing provisions of the proposed Final Judgment, Section III requires
that, so long as the judgment is in effect, McCaw and McCaw affiliates that are involved in the operation of wireless
systems and the provisions of local wireless services shall be maintained as corporations or partnerships separate
from AT&amp;T as specified in that section and in the Structural Separation plan to be filed for approval by the United
States pursuant to Section VII.A. Section III requires that McCaw and McCaw affiliates shall be maintained as corporations
and partnerships with separate officers and personnel and separate books, financial or operating records; retain
all wireless service licenses and title and control of the wireless infrastructure equipment used by its systems;
and retain responsibility for the operation of their wireless services, and may not delegate substantial responsibility
for such business activities to AT&amp;T, provided that AT&amp;T may act as McCaw's agent to the extent authorized
in Section IV.F and may provide general corporate overhead and administrative services to McCaw and its affiliates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to facilitate the monitoring of AT&amp;T's compliance with equal access and the manufacturing provisions
of Section V of the proposed Final Judgment, Section III.D requires that any interexchange services, wireless infrastructure
equipment and related engineering services or services related to the marketing of wireless services AT&amp;T provides
to McCaw or its affiliates be provided only pursuant to detailed filed tariffs or written contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as discussed above, Section III.E limits the use by McCaw and McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems of AT&amp;T
trademarks and trade names prior to and during the conversion of McCaw Cellular Systems to equal access.

2. Compliance Plans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section VII.A obliges AT&amp;T, not less than 90 days after entry of the judgment, to file plans for implementation
of the judgment's terms with the United States. This framework is drawn from similar procedures established in the
MFJ for the implementation of equal access and other nondiscrimination obligations imposed on the Bell Companies,
although in this proposed Final Judgment the Department of Justice has the authority to disapprove plans, and such
disapproval would have significant consequences. In particular, AT&amp;T must file a Structural Separation implementation
plan describing its implementation of Sections III and V.A.4; an Equal Access implementation plan for each McCaw
Cellular System, describing its implementation of Section IV; and a Nonpublic Information implementation plan,
describing its implementation of Section V.A. AT&amp;T must supplement the plans as necessary to describe the implementation
of equal access in subsequently acquired cellular systems and to describe significant changes in the plans. The plans
shall be effective 90 days after filing with the United States, unless disapproved by the United States by written
notice to AT&amp;T that identifies the manner in which the plan is insufficient. The Department may in its discretion
approve a plan in fewer than 90 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement to file plans to implement the detailed injunctions, and to obtain the approval of the United States
for such plans is intended to give AT&amp;T, McCaw and the United States flexibility to adopt procedures that best
accomplish the purposes of the judgment, so long as those procedures conform to the language of the judgment, and will
permit the United States to assure that AT&amp;T complies with its obligations under the judgment. In the absence
of an effective Structural Separation plan, AT&amp;T must comply with Section III without modification and may not
perform Proprietary Development for McCaw. In the absence of an effective Equal Access Plan, AT&amp;T may not provide
interexchange services to customers of McCaw Cellular Systems, except under arrangements existing prior to the
merger. In the absence of an effective Nonpublic Information plan, AT&amp;T would be enjoined from selling cellular
infrastructure equipment to any McCaw Cellular Systems or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems that were not equipped
with AT&amp;T equipment prior to the commencement of this action.

3. Modification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The duration of the proposed Final Judgment is ten years. Because it is possible that during that period there could
be major changes affecting competition in wireless telecommunications that could be material to the matters addressed
in this judgment, Section X provides certain grounds for modification in addition to the standards provided by the
common law applicable to the modification of government antitrust consent decrees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the equal access provisions of the judgment are modeled on those that the United States has recommended be imposed
on the Bell Companies if they are permitted to provide interexchange service from their wireless systems. Accordingly,
Section X.A permits AT&amp;T or McCaw to seek modification of the equal access provisions of Section IV of the proposed
Final Judgment if Bell Company wireless systems are relieved in whole or in part of the comparable equal access and
nondiscrimination provisions of the MFJ as a result of legislation, judicial orders or agency orders that vacate,
modify, supersede or interpret the provisions of the MFJ. In such an event, the provisions of Section IV of the judgment
shall be modified or vacated to provide the same relief to AT&amp;T or McCaw upon their showing that competitive conditions
do not require a different obligation for AT&amp;T and McCaw and the modification is equitable and in the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section X.B provides that changes in wireless telecommunications markets that could be foreseen at this time shall
not be a bar to modification. Specifically, if AT&amp;T or McCaw show that other wireless telecommunications services
have developed as effective competitive alternatives to today's cellular services, or that there have been other
changes or developments affecting a relevant market, a showing that intervening changes have made retention of a
provision of the judgment inequitable shall be sufficient to justify a modification, irrespective of whether those
changes were foreseen or foreseeable when the judgment was entered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, to assure that the procedures, practices and obligations of the proposed Final Judgment are implemented
without delay or distraction, AT&amp;T and McCaw have stipulated that they will not move for any modification of the
judgment, except with the consent of the United States, for eighteen months following the commencement of the action.
The United States will not unreasonably without its consent to modifications, and will consent to motions seeking
reasonable modifications that are justified by competitive conditions and are consistent with the purposes of the
judgment and the public interest.

actions, and any party may apply to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate for their modification, interpretation
or enforcement.

Alternatives To The Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative to the proposed Final Judgment, the United States considered litigation to seek an injunction to
prevent the proposed merger between AT&amp;T and McCaw. The United States rejected that alternative because the
relief in the proposed Final Judgment should prevent the possible occurrence of conduct the effect of which may be
substantially to lessen competition in the relevant geographic markets for cellular service, wireless infrastructure
equipment and interexchange service to cellular customers. The equal access provisions imposed by the proposed
Final Judgment will open McCaw's cellular systems to competition among interexchange carriers. Because the United
States believes that the proposed Final Judgment adequately protects against possible anticompetitive effects
that might flow from the proposed merger, seeking to enjoin the merger could only serve to prevent the achievement
of economic efficiencies and other potential procompetitive effects that might result from the merger of AT&amp;T
and McCaw.

The balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must be
left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role in protecting the public interest
is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree. The court
is required to determine not whether a particular decree is the one that will best serve society, but whether the settlement
is ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
within the reaches of the public interest.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
'' More elaborate requirements might undermine the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by consent decree.

A proposed consent decree is an agreement between the parties which is reached after exhaustive negotiations and
discussions. Parties do not hastily and thoughtlessly stipulate to a decree because, in doing so, they

Waive their right to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable
risk of litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving
of cost and the elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the
litigation.

The proposed consent decree, therefore, should not be reviewed under a standard of whether it is certain to eliminate
every anticompetitive effect of a particular practice or whether it mandates certainty of free competition in the
future. Court approval of a final judgment requires a standard more flexible and less strict than the standard required
for a finding of liability. ``[A] proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would
impose on its own, as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is `within the reaches of public interest.'

Without Equal Access, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 -->
Would Reduce Competition for Cellular Interexchange Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Cellular Exchange Service Markets are Not Competitive Today.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
II. THE BOCS' RESALE OF SWITCHED INTEREXCHANGE SERVICES TO THEIR CELLULAR SUBSCRIBERS, SUBJECT TO SUFFICIENT EQUAL
ACCESS SAFEGUARDS, SHOULD NOT RESULT IN AN ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES FOR INTEREXCHANGE SERVICE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 -->
A. BOC Entry as an Additional Choice, Subject to Equal Access, Should Not Result in an Ability to Raise Prices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Appropriate Safeguards are Required To Protect Against Discrimination in Access or Presubscription by the Cellular
Exchange Operator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Department's Proposed Order Will Substantially Prevent Discrimination in the Provision of Access
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Basic Injunction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Resale Restriction Will Eliminate Most Risks of Discriminatory Interconnection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Marketing and Unbundling Requirements Are Necessary To Ensure that Presubscription Provides a Genuine Opportunity
for Competing Interexchange Carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Appropriate Safeguards Are Also Required To Prevent Abuse of the Landline Exchange.

The United States submits this memorandum in response to three motions by the Bell Companies for generic wireless
relief: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The United States would support, if modified, that portion of the motion, dated June 20, 1994, of the Bell Companies
for a waiver of the interexchange line of business restriction of Section II(D)(1) of the Decree
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 in connection with their ``cellular and other wireless services'' (the ``BOCs' Motion''),
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 which seeks the authority to provide interexchange services between cellular exchanges subject to equal access.
A proposed order is attached to this memorandum.

The record before the Department on the Bell Companies' motion was submitted to the Court with the Bell Companies'
June 20, 1994, filing. The principal ``wireless'' service here at issue is cellular telephony, sometimes referred
to by the Court, Congress or the Federal Communications Commission as ``mobile radio,'' ``land mobile radio'' or,
most recently, as ``commercial mobile radio service.'' 47 U.S.C. 332(d)(1), as amended. The term ``cellular,''
describing a radio telephone service in which frequency is reused by dividing a service area into ``cells,'' also
describes the technology of services that might come to be offered by potential newcomers to these markets (i.e.,
licensees of special mobile radio (``SMR'') or personal communications services (``PCS'') spectrum). However,
for simplicity, the mobile and portable radio telephone service today provided by two licenses in each geographic
area is referred to in this memorandum as ``cellular'' service, as distinguished from SMR or PCS services. Other wireless
services, specifically paging and radiolocation, are discussed below at pp. 42&hyph;45.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The United States opposes at this time that portion of the BOCs' Motion that seeks to redraw the existing cellular
exchange areas to include Rand McNally's Major Trading Area (``MTA''), and adding to those MTAs all prior geographic
relief. The United States would support the BOCs' request for certain incidental relief, if clarified, and the attached
proposed order contains those clarifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The United States opposes the motions by BellSouth, dated April 15, 1994, and Southwestern Bell, dated June 20,
1994, to remove Section II(A)'s equal access requirement and Section II(D)(1)'s interexchange prohibition, as
applied to their wireless services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All seven BOCs sought that broader relief_the complete removal of the equal access requirement and the interexchange
prohibition_in their waiver request filed with the Department on December 13, 1991. The United States opposes this
relief because none of the BOCs can make the showing required to remove or modify the decree's equal access requirements.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 After extensive investigation and analysis, the Department has determined that the removal of equal access would
substantially reduce competition in interexchange services from cellular exchanges, but that provision of resold
switched interexchange services subject to rigorous equal access conditions would not be likely to reduce competition,
and so advised the BOCs by letter dated June 14, 1994 (copy attached as Exh. 1; exhibits separately bound).

As the United States has advised the Court, the legal staff of the Antitrust Division advised the BOCs in May 1993 that
it would recommend against removal of equal access, and the BOCs then chose to pursue a waiver limited to line-of-business
relief. Memorandum of the United States in Opposition to Motion of BellSouth Corporation for Generic Wireless Relief,
pp. 4&hyph;5 (Apr. 29, 1994). Thus, there was no request for removal of equal access from BOC cellular exchanges pending
when BellSouth or Southerwestern Bell filed their instant motions. Nonetheless, the Department's investigation
and analysis of the BOCs' requests has given it ample basis to oppose these motions on the merits, even though these
motions are, as the Court has recognized, procedurally improper. Order, July 8, 1994, at 4 &amp; n.2.

Summary of Argument 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Simply put, BellSouth and Southwestern seek to terminate their cellular exchange subscribers' ability to obtain
interexchange service from competing interexchange carriers, and to require those subscribers instead to obtain
that service from the exchange carrier_subject only to whatever competitive constraint is provided by the existence
of a second cellular carrier. The Department concluded that that minimal constraint was insufficient to prevent
a reduction of competition in cellular long distance. To the contrary, the market power of each cellular duopolist
appears to be sufficient to permit supracompetitive pricing of cellular service; allowing a cellular carrier to
provide interexchange service on an exclusive basis would permit that carrier to charge supracompetitive pricing
for interexchange services as well. The BOCs' unconstrained ability to abuse control of the local exchange provides
additional means to impede competition in interexchange services for cellular customers. See pp. 6&hyph;26 below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, however, a BOC or its affiliate were to be one of several interexchange carriers available to be chosen by a celluar
subscriber, the presence of that additional choice does not appear likely to result in higher prices for long distance_provided
that genuine equal access is preserved. If the arrangements under which the exchange carrier provides access were
not in fact equal, were discriminatory, or were administered to give the BOCs' own long distance service a significant
advantage, the likely effect would be that other interexchange competitors would be excluded unfairly from competing
for that business. As a result, absent genuine equal access, the Department is not persuaded that BOC entry into cellular
long distance from their cellular exchanges would not reduce competition in the market they seek to enter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether genuine equal access can be preserved when a BOC is providing access to itself and to its competitors is probably
the most difficult issue presented here.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Department believes that genuine equal access can exist in this situation, and has attempted to define the appropriate
equal access arrangements where a Bell Company stands on both sides of the equal access interface. The BOCs have said
that certain of these safeguards are acceptable to them, and have asked the Department to explain others.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The United States conditions its support for the BOCs' motion on these additional safeguards because, without them,
the requested relief does not pass muster under Section VIII(C) of the Decree. See pp. 29&hyph;40 below.

The Court has recognized the dangers of allowing a BOC to provide access to itself and to its competitors. E.g., United
States v. Western Elec. Co., 1986&hyph;1 Trade Cas. &para; 66,987, at 62,061 (D.D.C. 1986) (``once a Regional Company
is permitted to offer VSR services that are accessed through its own exchange network, it will have every incentive
to design the exchange system in a manner that disadvantages suppliers of competing VSR service'').

The BOCs also request generic modification of cellular exchange areas, purportedly along MTA lines but grandfathering
all prior cellular geography relief. The United States urges the Court to defer considering this issue. Wholesale
redrawing of the cellular exchange map seems unwise at this time, since the FCC has recently announced that it will
be considering this exact issue in its current rulemaking to decide whether to require that all cellular carriers
grant equal access to interexchange carriers.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Had the BOCs made a compelling showing for the relief they seek, the Court might nonetheless act on that showing. However,
the BOCs have not demonstrated that MTAs generally or individually reflect communities for cellular telephony.

If the Commission mandates equal access, and devises a cellular exchange area map, that map may_but probably will
not_correspond with the LATA map, as adjusted by the Court in the past. The Court will then be faced with the question
whether to modify the Decree map to conform to the FCC map. It would make little sense for the Court to determine whether
yet a third map should be adopted, when the Commission is likely to consider the same issue and where inconsistent results
would be especially problematic.

Because the Department's analysis of the BOCs' Motion turns in large measure on the vitality of equal access, Part

However, the United States believes that its ressponse to BellSouth's motion, and to the similar motion of Southwestern,
will provide a useful framework for analyzing the BOCs' joint motion. In order to understand how equal access should
work in preventing competitive harm, it is first necessary to understand why equal access is essential to prevent
that harm.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
To Remove Equal Access, Movants Must Show at a Minimum that the Removal of Equal Access from their Cellular Exchanges
Would Not Reduce Competition in Long Distance Services from those Exchanges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sought-for removal of the Decree's restrictions on cellular exchanges requires to separate modifications,
subject to two different standards of review. The removal of the interexchange restriction implicates the familiar
standard for contested waivers under Section VIII(C): Will ``the entering BOC will have the ability to raise prices
or reduce output in the market it seeks to enter''? Triennial Review, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
900 F.2d at 296.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of the equal access restriction is not governed by Section VIII(C), which by its terms applies only to modifications
of the line-of-business restrictions of Section II(D)(1). Instead, the motion to remove equal access is governed
by Section VII and the common law standard it incorporates. This Court recently discussed that standard:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[A] party seeking an opposed modification of a consent decree ``bears the burden of establishing that a significant
change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree.'' Such a change may be either a ``significant change in factual
conditions or in law.'' Modification may also be appropriate when ``enforcement of the decree without modification
would be detrimental to the public interest.''

B. As this Court Has Held Repeatedly, Cellular Exchange Service Is ``Exchange Service'' Subject To the Decree's Equal
Access Requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alone among the Bell Companies, BellSouth urges the Court to declare that the Decree's equal access and interexchange
provisions ``do no apply'' to wireless services. (BellSouth Mem. 6, Apr. 15, 1994) BellSouth has not withdrawn this
argument, which the United States rebutted in its earlier opposition to BellSouth's Motion (U.S. Mem. 6&hyph;10,
Apr. 29, 1994) BellSouth nonetheless argues that Section II should not be interpreted to have been intended by the
parties and the Court to be limited to the landline local exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As more fully set forth in our prior brief, BellSouth's argument is frivolous. Whether or not the issue was ``fully
litigated'' (BellSouth Mem. 11) as part of a trial that addressed all aspects of the telecommunications industry,
the Decree's interpretation is settled.

Southwestern argued to the FCC that it would promote competition if the cellular duopolists were awarded all of the
new PCS spectrum. ``[A] choice among service providers stimulates and ensures competition. *&blank;*&blank;*

claim here. ``[N]o provider has the ability to leverage anything at all, regardless of its incentives. There is always
a competing mobile provider down the road.'' Southwestern Mem. 12. As we show below, two providers is insufficient
for genuine competition in these markets, and Southwestern itself observes internally that these duopolies are
``highly attractive'' because of their ``absence of significant price competition.'' [SWB 218486]

Landline local exchanges can be used to impede competition between cellular providers. Triennial Review, 673 F.
Supp. at 551; see pp. 40&hyph;42 below. Cellular carriers and interexchange carriers both rely on local exchange
facilities for access, interconnection and transport. The Court has recognized that the dangers from BOC control
of an out-of-landline-region cellular system are no greater than BOC control of in-region cellular systems, but
has required both to provide equal access and prohibited both from providing interexchange services. United States
v. Western Elec. Co., 1986&hyph;1 Trade Cas. &para;66,987, at 62,055 (D.D.C.) (PacTel/CI''), rev'd on other grounds,
797 F.2d 1082, 1089&hyph;91 (D.C. Cir. 1986), cert. denied sub nom. US West Inc. v. United States, 480 U.S. 922 (1987).
Applying the Decree's equal access restrictions only to the ``landline switch,'' as the movants propose, would be
insufficient to prevent abuse of the landline exchange.

By contrast, the Department's proposed order adds to the protections against discrimination by the landline exchange
by prohibiting the BOCs from building and owning their own interexchange facilities, and limiting them to the resale
of switched interexchange services obtained from multiple vendors. See p. 37 &amp; n.50 below.

There is no reason to believe that the Decree's purposes end where the local landline exchange ends. The Decree's terms
plainly apply to cellular exchanges_as this Court's latest opinion and eight years of consistent application of
the Decree to out-of-region BOC exchange services makes clear. This Court has specifically applied Section II's
interexchange prohibition and other Decree requirements to an out-of-region cellular system, notwithstanding
the fact that the BOC did not control local exchange facilities in the cellular service area. PacTel/CI, 1986&hyph;1
Trade Cas. at 62,060. Subsequent orders, including orders sought by BellSouth and Southwestern, have also applied
Section II to cellular exchanges where the BOC does not provide landline local exchange service.

 This request for a modification turns on whether the modification is necessary to the public interest. Rufo, 112 S.
Ct. at 760. The determination of the public interest, in this specific context, asks whether eliminating equal access
from cellular systems will reduce competition in interexchange markets. The cellular carriers' duopoly status
gives them the monopoly or market power_terms the Court of Appeals has used interchangeably
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
_and that market power makes abuse of the cellular exchange an issue of competitive concern.

Cellular exchanges are ``bottlenecks'' if they can be used to prevent or deter a customer's access to interexchange
carriers, since customers have to go through one of the two cellular exchanges to reach their interexchange carrier.

Standard economics and antitrust texts recognize that monopoly power and market power are functionally identical
concepts. ``Pure monopolists, oligopolists and monopolistic competitors&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;all
possess some degree of power over price, and so we say that they possess monopoly power or market power.'' F. Scherer
&amp; D. Ross, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 17 (3d Ed. 1990) (hereafter ``Scherer &amp;
Ross''); accord, e.g., 2 P. Areeda &amp; D. Turner, Antitrust Law &para;&para;504, 507, at 325, 330 (1978) (hereafter
``Areeda &amp; Turner''); D. Carlton &amp; J. Perloff, Modern Industrial Organization 97 (1990) (hereafter ``Carlton
&amp; Perloff''). Any purported distinction between ``monopoly power'' and ``market power'' would hardly be meaningful.
See, e.g., Hay, ``Market Power in Antitrust,'' 60 Antitrust L.J. 807, 817&hyph;21 (1992). Professor Hay discusses
varying definitions of ``market power'' and ``monopoly power'' by courts and commenters, noting that at best the
distinction appears to be only that ``monopoly power'' is taken to mean ``a high degree of market power.'' Id. at 817,
818 n. 44. citing Landes &amp; Posner, ``Market Power in Antitrust Cases,'' 94 Harv. L. Rev. 937, 952&hyph;60 (1981).
Professor Hay concludes that ``the key to monopoly (or market) power is the power to control price (i.e., the power
to charge prices above the competitive level), and the power to exclude competition is an ingredient of that power
to control price.'' Hay, 60 Antitrust L. J. at 821.

The crux of the BOCs' original waiver application to the Department, seeking the removal of equal access and the unrestricted
removal of the interexchange prohibition on their wireless businesses, the BOCs argued that ``competition in radio
services is extremely robust,'' that ``competition is flourishing in mobile service markets,'' and that ``without
a showing of market power, the bell companies are plainly entitled to the relief they seek.''

Specifically, all of the BOCs argued in 1991, and the movants argue again, that equal access raises prices for long
distance by permitting non-BOC cellular carriers to buy long distance in bulk but charge retail rates; if equal access
were eliminated, the cellular duopolists would purportedly compete with each other on long distance, driving down
the price. BOC Mem. 45 (Dec. 13, 1991); BOC Reply Mem. 21&hyph;26 (Aug. 3, 1992); BellSouth Mem. 22&hyph;23; Southwestern
Mem. 27. To support this logic, it must be shown that the cellular duopoly is competitive. The facts, however, are just
the opposite. Cellular duopolists plainly have market power in cellular service, and the major premise of the BOCs'
argument therefore fails. It follows inexorably that if the BOC has market power in cellular service, and can exclude
competitors in long distance, it can exclude the benefits of competition that those competitors bring.

Dallas subscriber revenue per customer has always been good for a large market. *&blank;*&blank;* Over the last couple
of years, the Dallas property has been the SBMS leader in implementing changes to improve subscriber revenue. Subscriber
revenue per customer has declined 113.8% since 1988 while peak minute usage per customer has dropped 24%. Major factors
contributing to this performance are as follows: Changed from 30 second to full minute billing increments; raised
access charges on economy and basic plans; introduced `free off-peak' which initially resulted in higher peak usage.
Once established, eliminated the offering from low-end plans; increased foreign roamer rates *&blank;*&blank;*
Dallas has also increased activation fees, voice mail rates, and other miscellaneous charges. *&blank;*&blank;*
Dallas is also reviewing charging customers the interconnection fees charged by the Telco associated with customer
usage. In Dallas, this could be as much as 2&cent;/min, which would be a significant boost to subscriber revenue. [203143&hyph;44]

Similar to the other SBMS markets, the West Texas properties have been gradually increasing rates by changing the
billing increment, raising access charges and increasing roamer rates. Additional increases in rates will be gradual
as in the past so as not to create a competitive disadvantage. Further upward movement of the access charges is the most
likely course with the de-emphasis of the economy plans close behind. [203146&hyph;47]

 A look at BellSouth's pricing practices in Florida, a state in which BellSouth claims to be at a competitive disadvantage
against its A block competitor, McCaw,
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 is most revealing. Over the 1990&hyph;1993 time period in Miami, the state's largest market, BellSouth's average
per minute revenues for cellular service rose 21 percent, while its market share of service revenues rose from 48 percent
in 1990 to 50 percent in 1993, despite McCaw's larger share of minutes of use. For the years 1991&hyph;1993, BellSouth's
per minute revenues were two percent, nine percent, and 15 percent higher than McCaw's, respectively (in 1990, BellSouth
was one percent lower). In Jacksonville, over the same 1990&hyph;1993 period, BellSouth's per minute revenues rose
more than 30 percent, while McCaw's per minute revenues varied from

The simplest way to examine cellular service prices is to divide service revenues by minutes of use. This calculation
permits an observation undistorted by pricing plans and the like, and often is used by the cellular carriers themselves
to measure their performance. The pricing information in this memorandum is based on comparing service revenue and
minutes of use, based on data provided to the Department by the BOCs and McCaw in connection with our investigations,
and is submitted as Exh. 7.

 Therefore, the operators of those cellular systems could reduce competition for long distance service by denying
access to competing carriers and requiring cellular subscribers to obtain long distance at prices not set by competition
between those competing carriers, subject to whatever constraint exists through competition in the cellular market.
As the BOCs have recognized, non-BOC cellular carriers have done just that,

The Department's investigation indicated that cellular subscribers value the choice that equal access gives them.
This is particularly true for larger businesses, which seek to connect their cellular services to private networks
offered by interexchange carriers. By doing so, the business user obtains not only access to the features of the private
network, but also the very substantial discounts on long distance prices that are sold as part of the service.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 These are the very discounts that the BOCs seek to obtain (BOC Mem. 26, June 20, 1994); today they can be obtained by customers
of equal access systems, but generally not by others. Indeed the availability of equal access from BOC systems has
pressured

non-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BOCs (notably McCaw) to offer connections to large customers' private networks, in order to retain their business.
Businesses that do not obtain cellular service from equal access cellular systems have no access to these discounts
and services, and have been frustrated in their efforts to reduce their cellular long distance costs.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 While the largest businesses might have the leverage with their cellular providers to gain access for their private
interexchange services, smaller businesses and individuals cannot get those benefits_except where equal access
requires it.

Southwestern quotes AT&amp;T's economists, who made the same argument in support of AT&amp;T's efforts to acquire
McCaw: ``Since the monopolist can only charge the monopoly rent once, it has no generally applicable incentive to
favor its affiliate if another competitor can provide the good or service more efficiently.'' Southwestern Bell

The fact, as indicated in Southwestern Bell's own documents, is that a successful strategy for raising prices is to
focus on ancillary services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
pp. 16&hyph;18 above. Southwestern Bell has found that it can ``aggressively change(e) elements of subscriber revenue
to mitigate the effect of lower customer usage'' by raising the costs of ancillary services, for example, by ``increased
monthly access charges *&blank;*&blank;* slightly higher roaming *&blank;*&blank;* eliminating `night hours'
and extending peak hours in many of the markets.'' [SWB 203136&hyph;37] If Southwestern Bell finds that the best method
of increasing revenue is to raise the price of roaming rates and access charges, it stand to reason that it would find
it equally feasible and attractive to rise the rates of long distance charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southwestern's ``one monopoly rent'' argument is contrary to theory as well as fact. The theoretical model on which
Southwestern relies depends, in general, on the presence of many key and restrictive conditions, at least 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
four 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of which are not present here. First, as Southwestern Bell acknowledges, the theory is limited to unregulated monopolists.
Cellular duopolists are not universally unregulated: in California, home of 20 percent of the nation's population,
cellular prices are regulated.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 Second, the theory requires that the two inputs (here, cellular service and long distance service) be used in fixed
proportions; if the integrator or user can vary the proportions (by making more or fewer long distance calls) the general
argument fails. Third, the argument does not apply where the firm cannot price discriminate in the downstream market_the
long distance market_without vertical integration. Fourth, and most important, the argument applies only to the
situation in which a monopolist is integrating with a firm in a competitive market; here we have decidedly imperfect
competition in cellular, and (as the BOCs acknowledge) imperfect competition in long distance. The ``one monopoly
rent'' model does not speak to the situation of integrating oligopolists.

The movants point to two developments to support their argument that there has been a significant change in circumstances.
First, they argue that AT&amp;T's acquisition of McCaw, if permitted by this Court and the FCC, will substantially
change the cellular business by permitting entry of the nation's largest long distance carrier into the local cellular
exchange business. This entry, they argue will place the BOC cellular systems at a substantial competitive disadvantage,
thereby harming consumers. Second, they argue that entry into the wireless business is imminent in the form of SMR
and PCS. They suggest that entry of these new providers will eliminate the need for equal access to preserve competition
in the provision of long distance services to cellular subscribers. Neither of these developments justify the relief
the BOCs seek.

The proposed final judgment that the Department has negotiated with AT&amp;T refutes the BOCs' argument that AT&amp;T
will have different equal access rules. Rather, that proposed decree and the order proposed for the BOCs' motion applies
consistent rules to both the BOCs and AT&amp;T. The terms of the AT&amp;T/McCaw judgment, if approved, would expand
the scope of equal access to apply to McCaw cellular exchanges that do not currently provide equal access. As a result,
that judgment will eliminate the competitive disadvantage that the BOCs claim they currently face. Ironically,
granting the BOCs' motion would create the harm they claim they want to end_placing a cellular provider in a position
where it must provide equal access while competing with a provider that need not do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BOCs' other contention is likewise without merit. As yet, there are no SMR or PCS providers of wireless telephony
generally available today. It is, of course, possible that at some point these new technologies will offer wireless
service in competition with today's cellular duopolists. When it will happen and what effect, if any, it will have
on competition in the market for cellular telephone service is now unknown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC has not yet assigned PCS licenses. Indeed, the Commission has not yet even said when licenses will be awarded.
Once the licenses are assigned, the licensees must take a number of time-consuming steps before they can offer service.
They must develop the necessary technology, obtain financing and build networks. The very nature of PCS, including
the services to be provided and the technology to be employed, is not yet settled.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 BellSouth itself told the FCC that ``cellular systems and new PCS licensees will be competitors only to a very limited
degree.''
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 It is, of course, impossible to say how long it will take to develop PCS, but it appears that it will be some time before
PCS service will have any impact on competition for wireless telephony. Any assertion that PCS has changed the competitive
environment is premature at best.

Several firms are in the process of accumulating radio spectrum currently allocated to Special Mobile Radio (SMR)

Dispatch service is used by fleet dispatchers, such as those that issue assignments to taxicabs and utility repair
trucks. Some SMR providers offer interconnection with the public switched telephone network; such service, however,
is far less convenient than cellular service and is used infrequently. SMR customers who need mobile telephone service
usually have SMR and cellular telephone equipment in their vehicles.

Three firms are attempting to convert SMR spectrum to wireless telephone use. Nextel Communications Inc. is the only
firm that has begun construction of an SMR system that would provide cellular-like telephony service. Nextel has
noted that it could still face a number of difficulties, including having substantially less radio spectrum than
that allocated to cellular telephone providers (which could cause its costs to be substantially higher), a limited
number of equipment suppliers and a current inability to offer nationwide service. Nextel's filing also indicates
that its service might not have adequate voice quality.

The BOC's generic wireless waiver motion, unlike the motions by BellSouth and Southwestern, does not seek a modification
of Section II's equal access requirement. The only modification sought is that of Section II(D)(1)'s interexchange
prohibition. In light of AT&amp;T's opposition, the standard for review is that of Section VIII(C): whether the BOCs
have demonstrated that ``there is no substantial possibility that (they) could use (their) monopoly power to impede
competition in the markets (they) seek to enter.'' In the Court of Appeals' formulation, that standard requires the
BOCs to demonstrate that they will not ``have the ability to raise prices'' in those markets. 900 F.2d at 296. The United
States believes that, in an environment in which appropriate equal access safeguards prevent discrimination against
interexchange competitors, that showing is made.

A. BOC Entry as an Additional Choice, Subject to Equal Access, Should Not Result in an Ability to Raise Prices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above (pp. 13&hyph;23), the reason that the elimination of equal access would reduce competition is
that it would prevent cellular customers from obtaining the benefit of whatever competition there is in the interexchange
market.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 By contrast, if genuine equal access can be preserved, it seems unlikely that BOC entry into cellular long distance,
in competition with existing providers, would reduce competition in that market. Their entry might be competitively
neutral, or might actually result in lower prices; there does not seem to be a clear reason that_again, subject to genuine
equal access_their entry might raise prices.

There plainly is some competition in interexchange services, notwithstanding the BOCs' arguments. Indeed their
arguments are premised on the proposition that competition in bulk long distance, which they seek to purchase, drives
prices far below AT&amp;T's regulated Tariff 1 rates. See p. 20 &amp; n.28 above. Even at the retail level, the benefits
of divestiture and the equal access regime it created have substantially reduced long distance prices, as the Court
has often noted E.g., AT&amp;T McCaw Decision, 154 F.R.D. at 10.

The BOCs will enter the long distance market with no market share, no existing long distance customers, and no ability
to convert their current cellular customers to their own long distance services_except by persuading customers
that the BOC offers a better service or the same service at a lower price. To the extent the BOCs offer service at prices
below AT&amp;T Tariff 1 prices,
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 their customers (and the customers of other interexchange carriers, who may either demand lower prices or switch
to BOC long distance service) benefit. To the extent the BOCs offer service at prices higher than AT&amp;T's highest
rates, customers have alternatives.

The rates contained in AT&amp;T's Tariff No. 1 (sometimes referred to as ``Basket 1'' or ``MTS'' rates) are AT&amp;T's

The interexchange carriers' arguments against the waiver, as made to the Department during its investigation, do
not challenge this proposition. They challenge instead whether the BOC's provision of access to itself and its competitors
can ever be considered ``equal,'' and whether the BOC's control of the landline exchange overwhelms the analysis.

If genuine equal access is provided, the BOC will not have an unfair advantage over its competitors by reason of its
providing access to itself and to its competitors. If they have an equal chance to gain customers, the BOCs' competitors
will not be foreclosed from the cellular exchange. If the BOCs can only gain business by charging lower prices, that
would not seem likely to lead to the higher prices that the Court of Appeals noted was the test for Section VIII(C). These
arguments may seem tautological, but their import is that the focus of the inquiry should be on the question whether,
and under what conditions, a BOC cellular system can provide access to itself and its competitors without creating
a substantial risk that it will discriminate in providing that access. We now turn to that question.

B. Appropriate Safeguards are Required To Protect Against Discrimination in Access or Presubscription by the Cellular

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The structure of the Decree rests on equal access. AT&amp;T's discrimination against competing long distance carriers
formed the basis of the antitrust violation, and preventing discrimination by the exchange access provider was and
is the key to allowing competitive long distance markets to develop. Decree Opinion, 552 F. Supp. at 165. Recognizing
that merely enjoining discrimination would be insufficient to prevent that discrimination, the Decree required
a permanent separation of AT&amp;T's exchange and long distance businesses, id. at 165, 172, and prohibited the Bell
companies from integrating into the long distance business. Id. at 177. However, the Court recognized that the BOCs
might lose their monopoly power over time; the Court therefore added Section VIII(C) to the Decree, to permit entry
by the BOCs when that entry would be unlikely to reduce competition. Id. at 195.

To determine whether that entry is now appropriate, the Court should consider whether sufficient safeguards exist
or have been proposed to prevent the danger that the access provider, in providing access to itself as well as its competitors,
could discriminate against those competitors in the provision of exchange access.
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 As in 1982, simply enjoining discrimination is insufficient protection; specific proscriptions are appropriate
in light of the dangers presented, and those proscriptions should be adopted in a manner that will make detection and

To further the enforcement of these conditions, the Department believes that the grant of authority to provide interexchange
services should be subject to the following sanctions. First, that the Court should have the authority to withdraw
the waiver if a BOC violates the equal access requirements of the waiver and of the Decree; and, second, that the Court
reserve the authority to impose civil fines for violations. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(5).

The Department has considered these questions in the limited context of cellular services, and believes that appropriate

The Department does not believe that the BOCs should be prohibited from providing any interexchange services until
they can demonstrate that competition would not be reduced were they allowed entry into interexchange services generally.

Supp. at 545; see also United States v. Western Elec. Co., 777 F.2d 23, 29 (D.C. Cir. 1985), but believes that wireless

also makes explicit the implicit requirement of equal access, that the prices for cellular exchange not vary with

Section VIII(L)(2) provides the authorization for specific interexchange services to be provided in connection
with wireless exchange services. Section VIII(L)(3) contains specific equal access requirements related to that

Section VIII(L)(3)(a)(4) imposes an equivalent restriction on the sale of interexchange services; i.e., to the
extent a BOC provides interexchange services to the customers of its cellular affiliates and to the customers of competing
cellular affiliates, it may not vary the price depending on which cellular exchange service the customer buys. This
requirement, which has been questioned by the BOCs (BOC Mem. 22), is necessary to give meaning to the unbundling requirement.
Absent this constraint, the BOC could adjust the price of its interexchange service to create combinations of services
that its long distance competitors could not match. Moreover, it would be decidedly procompetitive if the BOCs were
to compete for long distance from each other's cellular exchanges and from McCaw cellular exchanges. A similar requirement
is imposed upon AT&amp;T and McCaw under the consent decree agreed to between them and the United States. AT&amp;T

themselves preferential routing and collocation. The BOCs' proposed equal access plan as presented to the Court
affirms that they will not give themselves those preferences. (BOC Model Equal Access Plan, p. 2). The Department
believes that 60 days' notice of changes to the network is reasonably necessary to allow competing interexchange
carriers sufficient time to modify their networks, and the BOCs have accepted that requirement. Id.

Wireless Exchange Services mean commercial mobile services, as defined in 47 U.S.C. 332(d)(1); provided, however,
that BOC Wireless Exchange Services are limited to services provided by corporations that have been established
as separate subsidiaries from the BOC's local telephone exchange companies (``LECs''), and provided, further,
that the principal facilities used to provide Wireless Exchange Services, including the MTSO and radio base stations,

Proposed Order, Section VIII(L)(1)(c). The purpose of this restriction to ``physically and operationally separate''
networks is to distinguish wireless networks that are physically separate from the landline exchange, such as today's
cellular networks, from networks that might be tightly integrated with the local exchange. It is unclear whether
such a PCS service could be offered by anyone other than the local exchange itself, and therefore it might not be appropriate
to allow BOCs to provide interexchange services from the network, just as it is not appropriate today for the BOCs to
provide interexchange services from their landline exchanges, on these conditions. The BOCs based their proposal,
and the Department evaluated this proposal, in light of current cellular architectures, and the Department therefore
recommends limiting the waiver to commercial mobile services offered from networks that are fully distinct and separated_both
physically and structurally_from the local exchange.

services excluded by the Department's proposed order (BOC Mem. 12); the Department's proposal makes that limitation

Call Completion Services, i.e., interexchange services resulting when a caller directs a call to a subscriber of
a Wireless Exchange Carrier that has instructed that carrier to forward calls to a location in another exchange area.
Such remote locations may include a network address (such as a telephone or paging number) stored at the MTSO, or a voice
mailbox or similar storage facility. In such cases, the BOC may provide only the interexchange portion of the call
from the point where it is redirected by the subscriber's Wireless Exchange Carrier's MTSO.

Proposed Order, Section VIII(L)(2)(b). This proposal reflects what the BOC's seek: the right to forward calls to
the cellular subscriber's chosen destination (including a voice mailbox), according to the subscriber's PIC, rather
than that of the call originator. The call originator might have thought he was making a local call, when the subscriber
had forwarded her phone to a distant city; the subscriber pays for that long distance segment and, if she chose the BOC
as her PIC, the BOC would carry the call. (See BOC Mem. 13)

The authority in this paragraph does not include the authority to provide an ``800 access to cellular'' service, which
the BOCs have not sought. However, in the proposed consent decree with AT&amp;T arising from AT&amp;T's proposed

the Department has agreed that AT&amp;T should have the right to market a ``calling party pays'' cellular service.

This service which would be offered to subscribers of Wireless Exchange Carriers would permit use of a number that
the subscriber could give out that would permit callers that were willing to pay charges for wireless services to reach
the subscriber through the wireless terminal. It is the Department's understanding that the availability of this
service may be important to the continued rapid growth of the wireless industry and that the feasibility of this offering
is likely to depend on whether the caller will know in advance what the charges for the call will be. Thus, it is contemplated
that for this service to be successful, carriers may need to average airtime and toll charges so that a flat per-minute
rate may be associated with the service. Thus, an exception to the requirement that separate charges for wireless
access and interexchange services is appropriate in this instance.

Equal Access plans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 The Department concurs in the BOC's proposal that they provide equal access plans, but Section VIII(L)(4)(b) of the
Department's proposed order specifies the matters that those plans should describe:

Each BOC's compliance plans shall include a plan for implementing equal access on a nondiscriminatory basis in the
context where the BOC access provider is also a competing interexchange carrier. These plans shall include detailed
procedures for implementing equal access from any Wireless Exchange System where a BOC acquires a controlling interest
after the effective date of this Section VIII(L), procedures for identifying to new Wireless Exchange Service customers
their choices for interexchange services, the terms and conditions whereby unaffiliated interexchange carriers
will be offered the opportunity to interconnect at any BOC Wireless Exchange Systems MTSO, the procedures for disseminating
to interexchange carriers any planned changes in network services or plans for implementing new services that may
affect such carriers services, procedures for assuring that any personnel of a BOC Wireless Exchange Carrier that
is involved in the marketing of interexchange services shall not have access to proprietary information of other
interexchange carriers, including but not limited to network interconnection arrangements and lists of interexchange
carrier customers or their usage statistics; a plan for the separation of the personnel that market interexchange
services from the personnel that administer presubscription; a plan for implementing Calling Party Pays service
if the BOC wishes to offer such a service; a plan describing its procedures to assure compliance with Section VIII(L)(2)(e)
of this Decree (including a plan for providing nondiscriminatory access to IS&hyph;41 or similar databases for all
carriers); and a plan for implementing CDPD service.

The effect of these sections is to make clear what matters the equal access plans should discuss, and that there is no
authority to provide interexchange services in the absence of an effective plan. A plan is only effective if not disapproved
by the Department. The requirement to submit plans and the Department's responsibility to review them_and the Department's
right to reject inadequate plans_should relieve the Court of the need to administer the minutiae of equal access,
and should provide the BOCs sufficient flexibility in the offering of services, without the need to return to the Court
for ministerial matters. Interested parties will have an opportunity to review the equal access plans and to alert
the Department to deficiencies they perceive.

2. The Resale Will Eliminate Most Risks of Discriminatory Interconnection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department proposes that the BOCs' authority to provide interexchange services be limited to the resale of switched
interexchange services provided by others. The Department has also indicated that its current view is that the BOCs
should purchase no more than 45 percent of their interexchange needs from single source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BOCs tell the Court, as they told the Department in seeking the Department's support, that ``as a practical matter,
*&blank;*&blank;* it is likely that the BOCs will mostly act as resellers of switched services in this context.''
(BOC Mem. 16) Nonetheless, the BOCs seek the authority to build and use interexchange facilities. The Department
believes that limiting the BOCs to switched resale will substantially reduce the dangers of discrimination, and
proposed that limitations on that basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By limiting the BOCs to reselling switched interexchange services, the BOCs will not be able to construct or operate
facilities, and therefore they will be unable to give their own facilities favorable treatment. Since they will be
reselling other carriers' services, any discrimination aimed at favoring the BOC's service would be readily apparent
at least to the carriers whose services the BOC was reselling. The benefits of that discrimination would flow to that
carrier for all of its traffic, and that carrier would be competing with the BOC. Therefore, the risks of discrimination
are here accompanied by a proportionately smaller benefit, reducing the likelihood of that discrimination. These
dangers are further reduced by the requirement that the BOC obtain not more than 45 percent of any system's interexchange
services from any one provider, thereby requiring the BOC to use three carriers and leaving less opportunity for the
BOC to discriminate against other carriers, and likewise increasing the difficulty of collusive behavior.

The BOCs have objected to this requirement as preventing them from obtaining the bulk discounts on long distance services
that would make it possible for them to resell interexchange services. (BOC Mem. 17) However, the BOCs have not provided
any evidence that the anticipated volumes will not entitle them to substantial discounts under currently filed tariffs,
at reasonable volume predictions. The Department has requested further information from the BOCs on this subject.
Although the BOCs argue that the 45 percent ``condition would prevent the BOCs from putting price pressure on any''
interexchange carrier (BOC Mem. 17), the Supreme Court's recent holding that all interexchange carriers must file
tariffs, MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone &amp; Tel. Co., 114 S. Ct. 2223 (1994), limits the concern
that the BOCs would be unable to take advantage of tariffed bulk discounts.

3. Marketing and Unbundling Requirements Are Necessary To Ensure that Presubscription Provides a Genuine Opportunity
for Competing Interexchange Carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meaningful equal access is premised on the idea that procedures can be put in place to provide competing interexchange
carriers a reasonable opportunity to complete for customers' business. Merely requiring the BOC to offer presubscription
seems insufficient, if the BOC can bundle cellular and interexchange services together in blended, single-price
offerings that do not permit customers the opportunity to compare the BOC's offerings with its competitiors'; if
the BOC can market its interexchange service together with its cellular service, while requiring the customer to
make separate inquiries to discover the availability of competing carriers; or if the BOC can provide a combined bill
for its cellular and long distance service, while requiring its competitors' customers to receive and pay two separate
bills.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's proposed order prevents these measures, and thus prevents the BOC from marketing or offering services
that its interexchange competitors cannot match by reason of the BOC's control of the duopoly cellular exchange.
To the extent the BOC designs service offerings that are attractive to customers, and successfully markets them,
the BOCs will properly obtain business. But their interexchange competitors will likewise be able to make offerings
that might be attractive to customers, on the same basis as the BOCs can.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific restrictions, which are set forth in Section VIII(L)(3)(f) and (g) of the Department's proposed order,
require a separation of the persons responsible for administering presubscription (referred to as the ``wireless
exchange sales force'') from persons who market the BOC's interexchange services (the ``long distance sales force'').
However sold, the BOCs would be required to state separately the prices for cellular service and long distance service,
and would not be permitted to offer blended or bundled service offerings. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(a)(5).
Nothing would prohibit them from making claims in marketing or advertising that either their cellular service or
their long distance service is more favorably priced than their competitors'. If a BOC provides its customers with
a single bill for cellular and interexchange service, it would be required to permit similar billing arrangements
by its long distance competitors. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department would not seek to preclude the BOCs from marketing the long distance services it believes they should
be allowed to provide, and believes that the long distance sales force should be permitted to sell cellular service
as well. However, this sales force should not be given any advantages not also given to the BOC's interexchange competitors:
It should receive any cellular customer lists at the same time and under the same terms as the BOCs' competitors, and
should not receive any additional information about those customers (eg. their cellular telephone numbers, their
usage patterns) unless the same information is provided to competing interexchange carriers.
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 The long distance sales force is also required to advise customers that they have a right to choose interexchange carriers.

Those carriers would be restricted in their use of that information to the marketing of interexchange services; interexchange
carriers affiliated with wireless carriers would not be able to use this confidential information to market wireless
services. The largest interexchange carrier, AT&amp;T, is subject to the same separation and marketing restrictions.
AT&amp;T/McCaw Decree, Section IV.C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``wireless exchange sales force,'' the group responsible for administering presubscription, includes salespersons
in retail stores and those who receive inquiries. Those salespersons, like persons selling BOC cellular service
today, would be required to provide the customer with a ballot to select an interexchange carrier, and would not be
allowed to sell long distance service or advocate that the customer purchase BOC long distance service. Proposed
Order, &sect;VII(L)(3)(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not agree with the BOCs that these restrictions are ``unduly restrictive.'' (BOC Mem. 18) Rather,
these marketing and billing restrictions are necessary to allow the BOCs to market their interexchange services
while providing their competitors with the opportunity to compete on equal terms, thereby providing consumers with
a meaningful opportunity to make an informed choice. By comparison, the BOC proposed order and equal access plan are
silent (or at best ambiguous) as to whether bundled service offerings are permitted, and whether competing interexchange
carriers will be permitted to create their own bundles.
<FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>
 The Department's proposal requires unbundled offers, and requires the BOCs to provide their long distance competitors
with customer lists at the same time as that information is provided to their long distance sales force.
<FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>
 Under these arrangements, carriers that do not control cellular exchanges, and cannot themselves provide both cellular
and long distance service, nonetheless have an opportunity to market long distance services to BOC cellular customers.

The BOC order does require that exchange access and exchange services of such access be provided to interexchange
carriers ``on an unbundled basis, that is equal in type, quality and price to that provided to any interexchange service
provided by the Bell company or an affiliate thereof.'' BOC Proposed Order &sect;I.4,p.3. If there were separations
between the cellular and long distance sales operations, this language presumably would prohibit the BOC from ``selling''
cellular service to an affiliated packager at lower prices than offered to competing interexchange carriers, and
the BOC could not bundle cellular and long distance services in combinations that other interexchange carriers could
not match. However, in the absence of such separations, it is unclear whether the BOCs' proposed order would in fact
prevent discriminatory bundling, and it would be difficult for the Department to determine, in attempting to enforce
the conditions to this waiver order, whether the BOC had discriminated. The Department's proposed order makes these
discriminations clearly prohibited and more easily detected.

The BOC equal access plan provides that a Bell cellular affiliate ``may use customer names, addresses and mobile numbers
to market its own interexchange operations only if it provides that information on the same terms and conditions to
unaffiliated'' interexchange carriers. (BOC Model Equal Access Plan, p. 4) However, absent separation between
the cellular and long distance sales forces, there can be no genuine assurance that the BOC will in fact not receive
these customer names before its competitors do, and little opportunity to enforce this requirement.

C. Appropriate Safeguards Are Also Required To Prevent Abuse of the Landline Exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also true, as AT&amp;T has stressed, that the possibility exists that the BOCs could use their control of the local
exchange to discriminate against competing interchange carriers, who rely on the local exchange for their access
to both the wireline and nonwireline cellular exchanges. Cellular exchanges likewise relies on the local exchange
for interconnection to local exchange customers, for access to interexchange carriers, and often for transport
between cellular switches and cell sites within the cellular network.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the dangers of discrimination in these local landline exchange facilities is present, that danger can be constrained
by injunction. The Department's proposed order specifically enjoins discrimination by the local exchange, directed
either at competing wireless providers or at competing interexchange providers. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(a)
(1), (2). In addition, Section VIII(L)(1)(c) and VIII(L)(2) make clear that the authority to provide interexchange
services is limited to the BOC's Wireless Exchange Service, which must be physically and structurally separate from
its local telephone operations. The long distance sales force in particular must be a distinct sales force, with separate
managers, from any sales force that sells products or services of any local telephone company. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(g)(1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These requirements are sufficient to prevent discrimination in this narrow circumstance. Not only would such discrimination
be prohibited explicitly, and subject to civil fine and loss of the authority to provide wireless interexchange services,
Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(5), but it would also be quite difficult to accomplish effectively, under the restriction
that the BOCs be limited to reselling other carriers' switched interexchange services. The resale requirement reduces
the risk of discrimination in the local exchange, possibly even more than in the cellular switch. The BOCs will be sending
their own long distance traffic over several carriers' facilities, which are also handling traffic originating
in the local exchange (for which the BOCs may not compete). In addition, the BOCs will be sending their interexchange
calls to interexchange carriers that will presumably also be serving their own customers that are subscribers of
the BOC wireless service. If the quality of transmission, for example, was significantly better for the BOC's customers,
it would be readily apparent to the interexchange carrier. In fact, any effort by the BOC to degrade the transmission
of competitors' traffic might well result in adversely affecting its own interexchange customers. Moreover, since
there are two cellular providers in each market, a BOC considering a strategy of degrading competitors' interexchange
connections might be concerned that customers would not associate their service problems with the interexchange
service, and thus might switch cellular carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also significant that the direct connection option exists for interexchange carriers deciding to obtain exchange
access to their wireless customers without routing their calls through the LEC's switched network. The existence
of this possibility could well deter discriminatory behavior out of concern that to do so would risk loss of access
charge revenues. The benefits of discrimination in these circumstances are slight, and the risks of detection may
be more substantial.

D. Provisions for Incidental Relief from the Decree's Equal Access Requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BOC's motion also seeks some incidental relief from the Decree's equal access requirements in connection with
their paging and radiolocation businesses, and in connection with certain aspects of their cellular businesses.
Subject to some minor clarification, the Department believes that these modifications (which AT&amp;T has not previously
opposed) are in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section VIII(L)(2) of the Department's proposed order, which parallels Section II(a) of the BOCs' proposed order,
states that the Decree's equal access and nondiscrimination requirements shall not apply to paging (with acknowledgement)
or radiolocation. These are substantially competitive businesses, without the market power of cellular, and the
Court has already granted generic interexchange relief for one-way paging.
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 The equal access relief confirmed here was implicit in that paging order, but this order confirms that a BOC paging
affiliate may combine interexchange services necessary to provide paging with the paging services itself, and need
not hand off interexchange links within the paging network to other carriers. The department's proposed order confirms
that this relief does not relive BOC local exchanges of their equal access and nondiscrimination obligations towards
unaffiliated paging companies; and that it does not implicitly grant the BOCs' motion for a waiver for 800 access to
paging, which is now pending with the Court (and which the Department supports). (U.S. Mem., Feb. 1, 1993)

Section VIII(L)(2)(e) of the Department's proposed order, which parallels Section II(b) of the BOCs' proposed order,
provides that BOC cellular systems can transmit IS&hyph;41 and comparable administrative messages on a non-equal
access basis, so long as they do not discriminate in favor of their own interexchange carrier in doing so. IS&hyph;41
is an industry standard that permits cellular systems to signal each other in order to, among other things, locate
roaming subscribers and determine whether their cellular phones are available to receive calls. Only if the signaling
messages indicate that the call can be completed is a voice path established to complete the call. The proposed order
will permit the BOC cellular systems to use IS&hyph;41 to locate their subscribers; they will then be required to turn
over the call to the customers's PIC (which could be the BOC or an unaffiliated carrier) to complete the call. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section VIII(L)(2)(3) of the Department's proposed order permits the BOCs to resell other cellular carriers' cellular
services, whether or not those other carriers provide equal access. Today the BOC can resell other BOCs' cellular
services, but not the services of cellular carriers that bundle cellular and interexchange services. This relief
will permit the BOCs to resell the services of non-BOC cellular carriers, and thereby attempt to provide greater regional
or national coverage, in competition with other providers who may seek to offer national presence (such as AT&amp;T).
This section also addresses the situation in which the customer of a non-equal access cellular system roams into the
BOC cellular system. If that customer does not have a PIC, the BOC may complete that customer's long distance calls
by using the BOC's long distance services.

The proposed modification, section VIII(L)(2)(f), would permit the BOCs to provide interexchange telecommunications
services in connection with the offering of Cellular Digital packet Data Service (``CDPD''). Although not specifically
requested by the BOCs, the department is including this service in its Proposed Order in view of the fact that a similar
provision was included in the Final Judgment proposed in connection with AT&amp;T's acquisition of McCaw. AT&amp;T/McCaw
Decree, &sect;IV.H, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;II.F. This provision would allow interexchange transport of packetized data from the cell sites to centralized
points before it is routed through a switching or routing device that is capable of handing it off onto separate facilities
specified by the customer. At this centralized point the modification specifies that the CDPD provider will hand
the message off to (or receive a message from) an Internet Node within the same exchange area, or transfer it to a private
network facility or interexchange carrier specified by the customer. Interexchange facilities used by a BOC to transport
the messages to and from the centralized points must be obtained from an unaffiliated interexchange carrier and the
BOCs are not authorized to provide the interexchange carrier service of transporting the messages from the centralized
points. The procedures for specifying the selection of the customer interexchange carrier for CDPD must be specified
in the BOC's compliance plans before they may implement this provision. The Department's recommendation for this
provision is based on our understanding that it will significantly facilitate the early provision of this important
service especially in area of relatively low demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions give the BOCs the ability to offer and provide cellular services in a reasonably efficient manner,
without seriously impairing the objectives of the decree's equal access provisions. None of these modifications
will prevent a cellular customer from obtaining interexchange services from the carrier of their choice; these provisions
will only permit the BOCs to offer cellular services to more customers more efficiently.

Enlarging local calling scopes moves traffic from the interexchange market, which is at least somewhat competitive,
to the celluar market, which in the Department's view is less competitive. By AT&amp;T's estimate, fully 25 percent
of all interexchange traffic is within MTAs.
<FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, the proposed relief could move as much as 25 percent of cellular-originated long distance traffic from more
competitive interexchange markets to less competitive cellular markets.

AT&amp;T's Supplemental Opposition to RBOCs' Motion to Exempt Wireless Service from Section II of the Decree, p.
17 (Oct. 25, 1993). This 25 percent estimate would be reduced in light of existing cellular waivers, which have expanded
the BOCs' coverage areas. See BOC Mem. 44 (``the switch to MTAs would not involve a very large expansion''). To the extent
that current coverage areas approach MTAs in size, less traffic would be ``duopolized,'' but there is likewise less
need for relief.

Recognizing the consequences of expanding local calling areas, the Court has held that it would only do so upon a showing
of ``community of interest,'' so that the Court could be satisfied that ``the public benefits accruing from slight
departures from the strict LATA boundaries to accommodate motorists with cellular phones were so substantial that
they outweighed, on this limited basis, the dangers to fair competition.''

 Traffic patterns and ``metropolitan complexes'' have been the Court's primary guideposts in making these exceptions,
as the BOCs acknowledge. (BOC Mem. 41)

The BOCs had 23 waivers pending at the end of 1991, when they agreed to hold those waivers in abeyance pending their pursuit
of this generic wireless waiver. Many of these waivers, such as BellSouth's waiver for all of the State of Florida,
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 cannot be justified by reference to traffic patterns or metropolitan complexes except in the most attenuated fashion.
Rather, MTAs reflect patterns of commercial activity (BOC Mem. 43), not the patterns of personal movement on which
the Court has relied. While ``patterns of traffic'' may exist among any two cities chosen at random (in that someone
probably went between them once), MTAs do not purport to represent areas within which people move on a daily basis.

Motion of BellSouth Corporation for a Waiver of Section II(D) of the Modification of Final Judgment to Allow BellSouth
Corporation To Provide Integrated MultiLATA Cellular Service, May 9, 1991. BellSouth made virtually no attempt
to show a community of interest for the State of Florida. Rather, BellSouth relied principally on arguments that its
cellular service faces competition. The only evidence of community of interest for the State of Florida that BellSouth
offers is that the Department of Transportation has observed that a certain number of vehicles crossed LATA boundaries
on a particular day. The fact that vehicles left the Tampa LATA on a particular day provides no support for the proposition
that ``subscribers will want and expect to be in communication with mobile units in this traffic which regularly crosses
from one LATA to another,'' Mobile Services Decision, 578 F. Supp. at 648, much less that people drive from Tampa to
Miami as regularly as they drive from New York City to northern New Jersey. See also Southwestern Bell's Response to
Comments (March 1, 1990) (``there is no requirement in Section VIII (c) that a BOC must make a showing that a ``community
of interest'' exists before the Court can grant a MultiLATA cellular waiver'').

It is also suggested that the FCC's decision to license some PCS spectrum blocks using MTAs indicates that MTAs are
appropriate local calling areas. (BOC Mem. 43&hyph;44) The FCC has also ``embraced'' Basic Trading Areas, which
are substantially smaller than LATAs. FCC PCS Order &para;76, at 7733. None of these determinations of the appropriate
size of radio licenses_the context in which the Commission considered MTAs as providing ``economies of scale and
scope necessary to promote the development of low cost PCS equipment'' (BOC Mem. 44, quoting FCC PCS Order &para;75,
at 7733)_reflects a determination by the Commission of the appropriate local calling ares for cellular systems providing
equal access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That issue will be taken up if the Commission decides to impose equal access on cellular or other wireless carriers,
an issue now open for comment before it. The United States proposes that the Court defer redefining cellular local
calling areas until the Commission has acted; the BOCs, having argued that the Commission's ``embrace'' of MTAs in
another context is determinative, resist allowing the expert agency to attempt to address this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would not be sensible for the Court and the Department to embark on this mapmaking project again, at the same time
as the Commission is considering the issue. The result could be that, instead of the one cellular calling area map now
devised by the Court, there could be three maps: The old adjusted LATA map, the new map drawn by the Court (whether MTAs
or something else), and a different map developed by the FCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It seems more sensible for the FCC to act first. If the Commission adopts equal access, and draws a map, then the Court
can determine whether that map addresses the needs of the Decree and, if so, conform the Decree's cellular LATAs to
the FCC's decision. If the FCC determines not to impose equal access, then the Court can revisit this issue_and the
BOCs can attempt to make a more persuasive case, or seek a more reasonable alternative. In the meanwhile, the Department
will consider the pending cellular geography waivers, which had been deferred, to be ripe for decision, and will advise
the BOCs shortly whether it will support or oppose specific waivers.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the motions of BellSouth and Southwestern Bell for complete removal
of the equal access and provisions of the Decree as applied to wireless businesses; and should grant the motion of the
Bell Companies for a waiver of the interexchange restriction subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the accompanying
proposed order.

Dear Mr. Kellogg: The Department has concluded its investigation and analysis of the Bell Companies' request, submitted
as modified on November 12, 1993, for a waiver of the interexchange line of business restriction of Section II(D)(1)
of the Modification of Final Judgment (``MFJ'') as applied to their ``wireless'' businesses, and other relief (the
``Generic Wireless Waiver''). The Bell Companies (``BOCs'') may proceed to file their motion for that waiver with
the Court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends to support the Generic Wireless Waiver, as proposed in the Bell Companies' submissions of
September 24 and November 12, 1993, only to the extent stated in this letter. The Department reserves its right and
responsibility to modify its position if it appears to the Department, in light of comments of interested persons,
further investigation or subsequent developments, that a change of position is appropriate. The discussion herein
follows the form of the BOCs' proposed order of September 24, 1993, as modified by your letter of November 12, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Interexchange Services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
the Department intends to support the BOCs' request for a waiver of the interexchange prohibition, subject to the
conditions stated in the proposed order and model equal access plan, on the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. That the authority to provide interexchange services is limited to the provision by resale of switched interexchange
services. Our current views is that not more than forty-five percent of any BOC cellular system's resold interexchange
service should be purchased from any one interexchange carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. That the conditions on the proposed waiver apply to any entity that is a BOC within the meaning of the MFJ.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
These conditions likewise apply to the relief sought in Sections II(b), II(c) and III of the proposed order, and to
the transmission of IS&hyph;41 or comparable administrative messages pursuant to Section II(a). The Department
recommends that Section II(a) be separated into two sections for ease of reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
c. That the scope of the authority to provide interexchange services is restricted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Telecommunications originating in a cellular exchange,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 as currently configured, or other similarly configured networks, distinct from the landline local exchange, wherein
radio is used to connect the network with a customer who is not at a fixed location. The BOCs have based their reasoning
supporting a waiver and the design of their proposed order and equal access plan on the architecture of their existing
cellular systems, and the Department will not support a waiver that is not limited to such systems or systems with similar
architectures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
``Cellular exchange'' within the meaning of this letter refers to an exchange service offering commercial mobile
services, as defined in 47 U.S.C. &sect;332(d)(1), in the 800 MHz radio bands. The Department understands that such
exchange services are provided by companies that are, pursuant to FCC regulation, separate subsidiaries from local
telephone exchange companies (``LECs''), and that the principal facilities used to provide cellular exchange service,
e.g., switching equipment and radio base stations, are physically and operationally separate from LEC facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Telecommunications intended by the originator to be directed to a cellular exchange, as described above, but
that the cellular exchange subscriber has forwarded to another destination (including a voice mailbox or similar
storage facility). The authority to provide interexchange services under this condition is limited to that portion
of the interexchange service from the cellular system to which the telecommunication was directed by the originator
to the ultimate destination. This condition specifically does not authorize the provisions of interexchange services
from the point of origination to the cellular system (e.g., an ``800 access to cellular'' service), which the BOCs
have not sought in this proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. That the authority be conditioned on an explicit requirement that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Each Bell operating telephone company shall offer to all interexchange carriers exchange access and exchange
services for such access on an unbundled basis that is equal in type, quality and price to that provided to any interexchange
service provided by the Bell company or any affiliate thereof.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
e. That the authority to provide interexchange services be conditioned on an explicit requirement that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Each Bell operating telephone company shall not discriminate between any mobile service provided by the Bell company
or an affiliate thereof and any nonaffiliated mobile service provider or between an interexchange service provided
by the Bell company or an affiliate thereof and any nonaffiliated interexchange carrier in the:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(a) establishment and dissemination of technical information and interconnection standards;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(b) interconnection and use of the Bell operating telephone company's telecommunications service and facilities
or in the charges for each element of service; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(c) provision of new services and the planning for and implementation of the construction and modification of facilities
used to provide exchange access.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. That the authority to provide interexchange services be conditioned on an explicit requirement that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Each Bell Operating Company or affiliate thereof providing commercial mobile service within the meaning of 47
U.S.C. 332(d)(1) shall offer to all interexchange carriers exchange access and exchange services for such access
on an unbundled basis that is equal in type, quality and price to that provided to any interexchange service provided
by the Bell company or any affiliate thereof.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
Implicit in this concept and in the concept of equal access is that the price, quality and terms upon which cellular
service is offered shall not vary with the customer's choice of interexchange carrier. That proposition should be
affirmed explicitly:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``A Bell Operating Company or affiliate thereof shall not sell or contract to sell wireless service at a price, term
or discount that depends upon whether the customer obtains interexchange service from the Bell Operating Company
or an affiliate thereof.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Department believes that the same proposition should apply to the sale of interexchange service:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``To the extent that a Bell Operating Company or affiliate thereof provides interexchange services pursuant to this
order to unaffiliated wireless services providers or customers thereof, the Bell Operating Company shall not sell
or contract to sell interexchange service at a price, term or discount that depends upon whether the customer obtains
wireless service from the Bell Operating Company or an affiliate thereof.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, in order for these guarantees to be meaningful, the Department believes that the Bell Operating Companies
should be required to state separately the prices, terms or rate plans for (a) wireless services and (b) interexchange
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
g. That the authority to provide interexchange services be conditioned on an explicit requirement that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Each Bell Operating Company or affiliate thereof providing commercial mobile service within the meaning of 47
U.S.C. 332(d)(1) shall not discriminate between any interexchange service provided by the Bell company or an affiliate
thereof and any nonaffiliated interexchange service carrier in the:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(a) establishment and dissemination of technical information and interconnection standards;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(b) interconnection and use of the Bell Operating Company's or affiliate's telecommunications service and facilities
or in the charges for each element of service; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(c) provision of new services and the planning for and implementation of the construction and modification of facilities
used to provide exchange access.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. That the BOCs shall file with the Department of a mobile equal access plan, which plan shall not be effective (1) until
90 days after filing, if not disapproved by the Department, or (2) if disapproved by the Department; that there be no
authority to provide interexchange services pursuant to this waiver until an equal access plan has become effective;
and that the plan at a minimum contains the specifications contained in the BOC Model Equal Access Plan submitted on
September 24, 1993, as modified by your letter of November 12, 1993, except in the following particulars:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Department believes that it is necessary in the provision of equal access that interexchange services not
be sold by the persons selling exchange services and who are required to administer presubscription (the ``cellular
sales force''). It is the Department's contemplation that this restriction would apply to retail store agents and
to other BOC salespersons who receive inquiries by prospective subscribers, i.e., salespersons who handle ``incoming''
prospects or requests for service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Persons selling long distance services (the ``long distance sales force'') may sell cellular services and long
distance services on the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) That the long distance sales force be a distinct group of individuals, with separate managers, from the cellular
sales force and from any sales force that sells products or services of the Bell Operating telephone companies.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) That the long distance sales force receive any list of the BOC's wireless customers on the same terms, and at the
same time, as that list is received by competing interexchange carriers. The Department anticipates that a BOC cellular
carrier will at regular intervals provide all long distance carriers with listings identifying the names, addresses
and telephone numbers of all cellular subscribers, regardless of the distribution channel through which the subscriber
was retained. It is a condition to the BOCs' direct marketing of cellular long distance that this information be made
available to all competing interexchange carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) That the long distance sales force must advise actual or prospective subscribers of their right to presubscribe
to competing interexchange carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) That the long distance sales force not receive any information about the identity of the BOC's wireless customers'
interexchange carrier or the wireless customer's cellular or long distance usage, unless the customer is already
a customer of the BOC's interexchange service.

(e) That the long distance sales force be a distinct group of individuals, with separate managers, from any sales force
that sells the products or services of any Bell Operating telephone company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Department understands that the marketing restrictions applicable to ``existing customers'' (as specified
in your letter of November 12, 1993) apply not only to customers existing as of the date of any Order, but also to persons
who become customers of the BOC wireless service thereafter. When such persons become customers, marketing of long
distance service to such persons are subject to the provisions on ``marketing restrictions: new customers''; after
such persons become customers, they are subject to the provisions on ``marketing restrictions: existing customers.''
The Department conditions its support of this waiver on this understanding, and on the further condition that the
BOC personnel marketing long distance services not receive wireless customer names, addresses and telephone numbers
until that information is also available to competing interexchange carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Department conditions its support for a waiver on the requirement that, if the BOC or its wireless affiliate
bills its long distance customers for that service in the same billing as for its wireless exchange service, it makes
that billing arrangement available to competing interexchange carriers on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.
It is the Department's understanding that most BOCs currently make such billing arrangements available to interexchange
carriers; if this relief is granted, the Department believes that the BOCs should not be permitted to terminate those
arrangements for competing carriers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) The Department opposes any authority pursuant to which the BOC might discriminate in the provision of interexchange
routing or in the colocation of interexchange points of presence in cellular MTSOs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Department believes that the BOCs should be required to notify competing interexchange providers of changes
to existing network services or the addition of new services that affect the interexchange carriers' interconnection
at least 60 days prior to implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The Department does not understand the Proposed Order to permit a BOC to treat its long distance service as the default
carrier for a customer that fails to make the required selection of an interexchange carrier. The Department understands
that customers who fail to select an interexchange carrier will not receive interexchange service from their wireless
telephones, and conditions its support for the waiver on that understanding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we believe that in this instance it is appropriate to condition the continued provision of interexchange
service on compliance with the equal access conditions and requirements of this waiver and of the MFJ. We also believe
that the waiver order should grant the Court the authority to impose civil fines, not to exceed $10 million, for violations
of equal access conditions and requirements of this waiver or of the MFJ in the provision of interexchange services
from wireless exchanges.

II. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Paging, etc. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department intends to support the relief specified in Section II of the Proposed Order, subject to the following
clarifications: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. That the ``IS&hyph;41 or comparable'' functions specified in paragraph II(a) not be used to discriminate in favor
of the BOC's own interexchange service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. That the default traffic specified in paragraph II(c) be explicitly limited to interexchange telecommunications
initiated by roaming customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Local Calling Areas. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that this issue should not be presented to the Court at this time and, if presented, intends
in the absence of further developments to urge the Court to defer ruling on this issue. On June 9, 1994, the Federal Communications
Commission announced the issuance of a Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Notice of Inquiry, pursuant to which the
Commission indicated that it has tentatively concluded that imposing equal access obligations on cellular telephone
companies would be in the public interest. The text of the Notice is not yet available to the public or to the Department.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department understands that any such equal access obligation necessarily requires the adoption of a map defining
local calling areas and delimiting the respective areas of local and long distance service. Therefore, if the Commission
acts in accord with its tentative decision, it will need to consider the appropriate local calling areas for cellular
service, the issue raised by this portion of the BOCs' proposal. The FCC's conclusions may result in the imposition
by regulation of a local calling area map that is different from either (1) the current cellular calling areas, as defined
by the MFJ and subsequent orders, and (2) the relief the BOCs seek here. Given the possibility of inconsistent results,
it would not be productive for the Court to consider a comprehensive redefinition of local calling areas at the same
time that the FCC is considering the same issue. If the FCC does not adopt a final rule on cellular equal access, the Court
may then consider whether it wants to make substantial changes to the cellular equal access map. The Department will,
during the pendency of the FCC proceeding, evaluate pending calling area waiver requests to determine whether they
meet the standards for such relief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

IV. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
FCC Preemption. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not support the relief sought in Section IV of the Proposed Order. If the FCC adopts an equal access
order that reasonably achieves the purposes of the Decree, including equal access, but differs in some technical
respects in its implementation of those purposes, it may be appropriate for the Department and the Court to consider
whether it is necessary or wise to maintain two sets of equal access obligations. However, it would in our view be inappropriate
to make that determination before the Commission adopts a final rule on this subject.

In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on May 19, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm. The notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28429). The certification was amended on June 30, 1994 to include workers in Michigan and Missouri.
The amended notice was published in the

 on July 8, 1994 (59 FR 35145&hyph;6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the State Agency, the Department again reviewed its certification for the workers of Gandalf Systems
Corporation. New findings show that Gandalf Systems had several field worker separations occurring in Texas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports.
Accordingly, the Department is amending its certification to include worker separations in the below cited States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
On July 25, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regrading Application for Reconsideration
for former workers of the subject firm. The affirmative notice regarding application was published in the Federal
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41795).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The workers produced coal which was used to make coke for steelmaking operations. Worker separations occurred in
1993 and 1994. The mine closed in March 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On reconsideration the Department contacted Sunnyside's major customer of coal. The customer reported using Sunnyside's
coal to make coke. This process involves baking the coal, not burning or consuming it as fuel. The baking process releases
all the volatiles, leaving a residue called coke which is used in steelmaking operations. New findings on reconsideration
show that Sunnyside's major customer increased its imports of coke in the period relative to the petition while ceasing
its purchases of coal from Sunnyside.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Departmental regulations at 29 CFR 90.2 state that an imported article is like or directly competitive with a domestic
article at an earlier or later stage of production and a domestic article is like or directly competitive with an imported
article at an earlier or later stage of production, if the importation of the article has an economic effect on the producers
of the domestic article comparable to the effect of importing the article in the same stage of production as the domestic
article. Accordingly, imported coke is directly competitive with domestically-produced coal in that coking is
a later stage in the processing of coal.

After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the former workers
of the Sunnyside Coal Company in Sunnyside, Utah were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or
directly competitive with coal produced at the Sunnyside Coal Company in Sunnyside, Utah.

<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 267a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates and
fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedes decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Ave. NW., room S&hyph;3014, Washington, DC 20210.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Endowment for the Arts is requesting proposals leading to the award of a Cooperative Agreement to assist
in planning, organizing, and implementing the activities of the Mayors' Institute on City Design. The Mayor's Institute
is a series of forums dedicated to the improvement of the design of American cities. The Institute's activities include
two semi-annual two and one half day conferences (institutes), publication of a semi-annual newsletter, alumni
programs at two to four national mayors' conferences, coordination of the activities of four regional institutes,
and maintenance of institute accounts and archives. The national office of the Mayors' Institute on City Design which
will be supported by the Cooperative Agreement will direct these activities, while the national institutes themselves
may take place at other suitable locations as determined by the Endowment and the successful recipient of the Cooperative
Agreement. The initial period of the Cooperative Agreement will be one year with potential renewal for an additional
two years. Funding is limited to $200,000 for the first year. Those interested in receiving the Solicitation package
should reference Program Solicitation PS 94&hyph;14 in their written request. Requests must be accompanied by two
(2) self-addressed labels. Verbal requests for the Solicitations will not be honored.

<DOCTITLE>Georgia Power Co. Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed no Significant
Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR&hyph;57 issued to the Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, Municipal Electric
Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee) for operation of the Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, Unit
1, located in Appling County, Georgia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would make a one-time change to Technical Specification (TS) 3.9.C for Hatch Unit 1 regarding
the emergency diesel generator (DG) operability requirements during reactor shutdown conditions. Current TS 3.9.C
requires two DGs be operable during reactor shutdown when a core or containment cooling system is required to be operable.
The proposed amendment would revise the current requirement such that only one emergency DG is required to be aligned
to its associated core or containment cooling system during a specific time of the outage. During this time period
the decay heat removal (DHR) system will be in service. The DHR system, which is completely independent of the existing
shutdown cooling system, is powered by the Baxley substation and has it own DG as a backup power supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee is requesting this one-time change for the fall 1994 Unit 1 refueling/maintenance outage to perform
local rate testing on the residual heat removal system loops and maintenance on DG 1A. Other limitations are: (1) the
other DG will be aligned to its corresponding core or containment cooling system, (2) the reactor cavity is flooded,
and (3) the fuel pool gates are removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration because it does not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the proposed change slightly increases the probability of a loss of RHR [Residual Heat Removal] shutdown
cooling, the probability of the total loss of decay heat removal for the core is not increased. Upon an LOSP [Loss-of-Offsite
Power], coupled with the failure of one DG, RHR shutdown cooling (with two RHR pumps and their respective DGs available)
will still be available. One diesel out of service, as will be the case on outage days 5 and 6, an LOSP, coupled with a diesel
failure, will render RHR shutdown cooling unavailable. However, on outage days 5 and 6, the DHR system is also affected
by the LOSP, its backup diesel can be manually placed into service. Furthermore, the RHR shutdown cooling system is
susceptible to a single failure on loss of suction path (inadvertent closure of either value E11&hyph;F008 or F009
even without an LOSP).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
However, on outage days 5 and 6, the RHR and DHR systems will be available for decay heat removal; thus, the unit will
not be susceptible to either single failure with respect to core decay heat removal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal does not involve any changes to the secondary containment, secondary containment ventilation systems,
the standby gas treatment system or any other radiological release control systems. Therefore, the consequences
of a loss of decay heat removal event are not increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This evolution is being performed in the refueling mode of operation, outside the realm of FSAR [Final Safety Analysis
Report] assumed accidents, except for a refueling accident. Since this proposal does not involve changes to any fuel
handling mechanisms, the probability of a refueling accident is not increased. Furthermore, this proposal does
not involve any changes to the operation or maintenance of any safety-related component designed to prevent or mitigate
the consequences of previously analyzed events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on this discussion, the proposed Technical Specifications change does not increase the probability
or consequences of any previously analyzed accident or transient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different event from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change does not introduce any new modes of operation. All affected system; i.e., the RHR systems, DGs,
and the DHR system, will be operated within their design specifications. Although the nonsafety-related DHR is a
relatively new system, it was installed, successfully tested, and used for decay heat removal during the Spring 1994
Unit 2 outage. Therefore, no failure modes that have not been previously considered are introduced by this proposed
change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Significantly reduce the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed decay heat removal configuration, which will be in use during outage days 5 and 6, uses the DHR system as
the primary decay heat removal mechanism, with RHR loop A as a backup. Although the DHR system is not designed as a safety-related
system, it is conservatively designed with sufficient heat removal capacity and redundancy to provide full heat
removal capacity in a variety of conditions. In fact, testing during the Unit 2 Spring 1994 outage showed that even
early in the outage (approximately day 3) the DHR system is fully capable of handling the decay heat load of the reactor
and the spent fuel pool. Additionally, even though the DHR system takes a suction from, and discharges to, the spent
fuel pool, adequate natural circulation is firmly established between the pool and the reactor vessel such that adequate
decay heat removal is taking place for both the pool and the reactor. This was demonstrated via special test performed
during the Spring Unit 2 refueling outage. In addition, duplicates of major components are provided so that loss of
any one component does not result in loss of system function. Therefore, as far as decay heat removal capability is
concerned, the margin of safety is not reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed previously, if an LOSP occurs, failure of DG 1C will result in a total loss of RHR shutdown cooling capacity,
since RHR loop 1B will be out of service for LLRT. However, a loss of decay heat removal will not occur, since the DHR system
is in service and is supplied power for the Baxley, Georgia, substation. However, if the Baxley power supply should
fail, the DHR system has its own backup diesel that can be placed in service manually within 4-hour period. Therefore,
the margin of safety associated with an LOSP is not reduced as a result of this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the configuration of decay heat removal systems on days 5 and 6 in is compliance with the existing Unit
2 Specifications, which only require one RHR pump and one DG in Condition 5 (Specifications 3.9.12 and 3.8.1.2, respectively).
Thus, the margin of safety, with respect to the exiting Unit 2 Specifications, is not reduced.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the
need to take this action will occur very infrequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By September 26, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the
subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes
to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules
of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy
of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Appling County Public Library, 301 City Hall
Drive, Baxley, Georgia 31513. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition
for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how
that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons
why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's
right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,
or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding
on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the
proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or
who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the
first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity
requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding,
a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which
are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or
fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the
contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which
the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references
to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely
to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine
dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within
the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner
to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least
one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. &sect;78s(b)(1), notice
is hereby given that on May 31, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On August 2, 1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No.
1 to the proposed rule change, the subject matter of which supersedes the original proposal.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 On August 8, 1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 2 (``Amendment No. 2'') to the proposal to clarify how the index
will be weighted when the composition of the index changes from its current number of eleven components.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amex proposes to trade options on the Amex/Oscar Gruss Israel Index (``Israeli Index'' or ``Index''), a new stock
index developed by the Amex in conjunction with Oscar Gruss &amp; Son, Inc. based on Israeli stocks (or ADRs thereon)
trades on the Amex, New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), or that are National Market (``NM'') securities traded through
the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex and at the Commission.

In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C
below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amex has developed a new index called The Amex/Oscar Gruss Israel Index, based entirely on shares of widely held
Israeli stocks and American Depository Receipts (``ADRs'') traded on the NYSE, or that are NM securities. The Index
contains securities of highly capitalized companies with major business interests in Israel. These include companies
which are incorporated in Israel, whose offices are located in Israel, or whose research and development activities
are concentrated in Israel.

Index Calculation and Maintenance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index is calculated using a ``modified'' equal dollar weighting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 methodology. Five of the eleven component securities have been given a higher weighting in the Index in order to more
closely approximate the weight the industry represented by that component has in the Israeli stock market. For example,
ECI Telecom Ltd. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which are the largest capitalized components in the Index,
will have a higher weight in the Index, but not as high as if the Index were capitalization weighted. The Amex believes
that this ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology allows the Index to be a more accurate reflection of the
Israeli market since it provides a higher weighting for the larger capitalized components, yet does not permit those
stocks not dominate the Index. The Exchange believes that this method of calculation is important given the great
disparity in market value of a few of the Index's components. It has been the Exchange's experience that options on
market value weighted indexes dominated by one or two components are less useful to investors, since the index will
tend to represent the one or two components and not the group as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following is a description of how the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting calculation method works. As of the
market close on June 17, 1994, a $100,000 portfolio comprised of eleven Israeli component securities was established
representing a hypothetical ``investment'' (rounded to the nearest whole share) of $12,000 in the five largest capitalized
Index components and $6,667 in each of the six remaining Index Components. The value of the Index equals the current
market value (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, based on U.S. primary market prices) of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the Index components divided
by the Index divisor. The Index divisor was initially determined to yield the benchmark value of 213.00 at the close
of trading on June 17, 1994. Each quarter thereafter, following the close of trading on the third Friday of March, June,
September and December, the Index components will be ranked in descending market capitalization order and the Index
portfolio adjusted by changing the number of whole shares of each component stock so that the five largest capitalized
stocks in the Index represent 60% of the Index value, and the remaining 40% of the Index value is evenly distributed
over the remaining securities. If the number of components in the Index changes from eleven securities, the Amex will
continue to weight the five components with the highest market capitalization 12%. The remaining components will
then be weighted equally.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 For example, if two new components are added to the Index, the five securities with the highest market capitalizations
will be assigned 12% weightings while the remaining eight securities in the Index would be weighted 5%.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange has chosen to rebalance following the close of trading on the quarterly expiration cycle because it allows
an option contract to be held for up to three months without a change in the Index portfolio while at the same time, maintaining
the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting feature of the Index. If necessary, a divisor adjustment is made at the rebalancing
to ensure continuity of the Index's value. The newly adjusted portfolio becomes the basis for the Index's value on
the first trading day following the quarterly adjustment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex states that it has had experience making regular quarterly adjustments to a number of its indexes and has not
encountered investor confusion regarding the adjustments, since they are done on a regular basis and timely, proper
and adequate notice is given. An information circular is distributed to all Exchange members notifying them of the
quarterly changes. This circular is also sent by facsimile to the Exchange's contacts at the major options firms,
mailed to recipients of the Exchange's options related information circulars, and made available to subscribers
of the Options News Network. In addition, the Exchange will include in its promotional and marketing materials for
the Index a description of the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology. As noted above, the number of shares
of each component stock in the Index portfolio remains fixed between quarterly reviews except in the event of certain
types of corporate actions such as the payment of a dividend other than an ordinary cash dividend, a stock distribution,
stock splits, reverse stock splits, a rights offering distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, or similar
event with respect to the component stocks. In a merger or consolidation of an issuer of a component stock, if the stock
remains in the Index, the number of shares of that security in the portfolio may be adjusted, to the nearest whole share,
to maintain the components' relative weight in the Index at the level immediately prior to the corporate action. In
the event of a stock replacement, the average dollar value of the remaining portfolio components in the same weighting
tier as the stock being replaced will be calculated and that amount ``invested'' in the stock of the new component,
to the nearest whole share. In all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure Index continuity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex will calculate and maintain the Index, and pursuant to Exchange Rule 901C(b) may at any time or from time to
time substitute stocks, or adjust the number of stocks included in the Index, based on changing conditions in Israel.
However, the Exchange will not decrease the number of Index component stocks to less than nine or increase the number
of component stocks to greater than fourteen without prior Commission approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The value of the Index will be calculated continuously and disseminated every 15 seconds over the Consolidated Tape
Association's Network B.

The Exchange proposes to trade cash-settled, European-style Index options (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, exercises are permitted at expiration only). The Exchange also proposes that Israeli Index options will have trading
hours from 9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. EST. As with other index options traded on the Amex, the options on the Index will expire
on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day
in an option series will normally be the second to last business day preceding the Saturday following the third Friday
of the expiration month (normally a Thursday). Trading in expiring options will cease at the close of trading on the
last trading day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Index value for purposes of settling a specific Israeli Index option will be calculated based upon the primary
exchange regular way opening sale prices for the component securities.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 In the case of NM securities, the first reported sale price will be used. As trading begins in each of the Index's component
securities, its opening sale price is used in the calculation. Once all of the component stocks have opened, the value
of the Index is determined and that value is used as the settlement value of the option. If any of the component stocks
do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior day's last sale price is used in the
calculation.

The Exchange plans to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the two additional
calendar months in the March cycle. In addition, longer term option series having up to thirty-six months to expiration
may be trade. In lieu of such long-term options on a full-value Index level, the Exchange may instead list long-term,
reduced-value put and call options based on one-tenth (1/10th) the Index's full-value. In either event, the interval
between expiration months for either a full-value or reduced-value long-term option will not be less than six months.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index's component securities all have major business interests in Israel, and have been selected on the basis
of their market capitalization, trading liquidity, and representation of Israeli business industries. The Amex
believes the components represent the largest and most liquid of all Israeli securities trading in the U.S., and that
the Index tracks closely the performance of larger broad market Israeli indexes, such as the Oscar Gruss Israel Index,
which contains all of the more than 50 Israeli securities currently traded in the U.S. This index is carried in the Israeli
press as well as by Bloomberg L.P., a major U.S. data vendor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In choosing among Israeli stocks that meet the minimum criteria set forth in Exchange Rule 901C, the Exchange will
select stocks that: (1) have a minimum market value in U.S. dollars of at least $75 million, except that for each of the
lowest weighted component securities in the Index that in the aggregate account for no more than 10% of the weight of
the Index, the market value may be at least $50 million; (2) have an average monthly trading volume in the U.S. markets
over the previous six month period of not less than 500,000 shares (or ADRs); (3) have at least 85% of the numerical Index
value and at least 80% of the total number of component securities meeting the current criteria for standardized option
trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915; and (4) are reported securities that trade on either the NYSE, Amex (subject
to the limitations of Rule 901C), or are NM securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex will ensure that no more than 20% of the weight of the Index is represented by ADRs overlying foreign securities
that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Currently, no Index components have the majority of their trading volume occurring on an exchange with which the Amex
does not currently have in place an effective surveillance sharing agreement.

Exchange Rules Applicable to Stock Index Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of regular and long-term contracts based on the Index. These
Rules cover issues such as surveillance, exercise prices, and position limits. Surveillance procedures currently
used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also be used to monitor trading in options
on the Index. The Index is deemed to be a Stock Index option under Rule 901C(a) and a Stock Index Industry Group under
Rule 900C(b)(1). With respect to Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, within ten points above or below the current index value) options series on the Index at 21/2 point strike (exercise)
price intervals when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange proposes to establish, pursuant
to Rule 904C(c), a position limit of 7,500 contracts on the same side of the market.

The Exchange seeks to have the ability to utilize its Auto-Ex system for orders in Index options of up to 50 contracts.
Auto-Ex is the Exchange's automated execution system which provides for the automatic execution of market and marketable
limit orders at the best bid or offer at the time the order is entered. The Exchange believes the ability to use Auto-Ex
for orders of up to 50 contracts will provide customers with liquid markets and expeditious executions. The Amex represents
that it has the necessary systems capacity to support new series that would result from the introduction of Israeli
Index Options.

In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to ensure that all broker-dealers assigned to the Exchange as their Designated
Examining Authority (``DEA'') provide the Exchange with reports of all outside assets and liabilities attributable
to the broker-dealer. This will enable the Exchange to independently review and confirm the capital computations
and consolidated financial condition of Exchange DEA assigned broker-dealers, thereby enhancing its oversight
responsibilities in conjunction with the Commission's more stringent reporting requirements under the Net Capital
Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory basis for the proposed rule change is Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, in that the rule is designed to prevent
fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation
and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect
to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and
open market and a national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and is not designed
to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriated and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 22, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposal to amend its rules to impose fees on market makers who fail to observe certain participation duties on the
Retail Automated Execution System (``RAES'') for equity and Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index (``SPX'') classes of
options. Among other things, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rules 8.16, ``RAES Eligibility in Equity Options'' and
24.16, ``RAES Eligibility in SPX/NDX,'' to impose the following fees for failures to satisfy the rules' log-off requirements:
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 (1) a fee of $100.00 for each of one to three failures within one twelve-month period; (2) a fee of $250.00 for each of
four to six failures within one twelve-month period; and (3) a fee of $500.00 for each of seven or more failures within
one twelve-month period. In addition, the proposal provides that members who fail to meet the log-on requirements
of CBOE Rules 8.16(b) or 24.16(b) ordinarily will be suspended from participation on RAES at the applicable trading
station for a period extending to 21 consecutive business days.

CBOE Rules 8.16(a)(iii) and 24.16(a)(iii) require a market maker participating in RAES for equity or SPX options
to continue on the system only as long as he is present in the trading crowd and to log off RAES when he leaves the trading
crowd, unless the departure is for a brief interval.

CBOE Rule 8.16(b) states that in option classes designated by the Market Performance Committee (``MPC''), any market
maker who has logged on RAES at any time during an expiration month must log on the RAES system in that option class whenever
he is present in that trading crowd until the next expiration. CBOE Rule 24.16(b) states that unless exempted by the
MPC, any market maker who has logged on RAES at any time during an expiration month must log on the RAES system in SPX/NDX
whenever he is present in that trading crowd until the next expiration.

The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposed rule change is to impose fees on members who fail to observe the RAES
log-off requirements set forth in CBOE Rules 8.16(a) and 24.16(a). The proposed fees for equity and SPX RAES are identical
in amounts and graduated structure to the fees approved recently for failures to comply with the log-on and log-off
requirements for Standard &amp; Poor's 100 Index (``OEX'') options.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 For OEX options, and as proposed for SPX and equity options, the fee amounts increase in relation to the number of times
each calendar year that a member does not log off as required.

As is the case for fees applicable to OEX RAES participants under existing CBOE Rule 24. 17, ``RAES Eligibility in OEX,''
the proposed fees do not constitute disciplinary action, although the CBOE's review procedures in Chapter XIX, ``Hearings
and Review,'' of the CBOE's rules will be available for review of fees assessed under the proposal. The CBOE states
that the Commission has noted the appropriateness of such fees and appeal rights in a related context.

Specifically, in approving a CBOE proposal that included procedures for contesting the fees assessed for delayed
submission of trade data, the Commission stated that ``Although such formalized procedures are unusual for challenging
fee assessments, they actually make the imposition of the fee fairer by allowing members to challenge erroneous fee
charges. Moreover, these procedures are reasonably designed to afford a member assessed a fee the opportunity to
challenge the veracity of the assessments.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to establishing a fee schedule for failures to comply with log-on and log-off requirements, the CBOE proposes
to issue a Regulatory Circular that will reaffirm the nature of CBOE market makers' RAES log-on and log-off responsibilities
in equity and SPX options classes and describe the consequences that attach to any market maker's failure to observe
these responsibilities. The Regulatory Circular addresses four points. First, CBOE Rules 8.16(a)(iii) and 24.16(a)(iii)
require any market maker who has logged onto RAES at a trading station on any given trading day to log off RAES whenever
the market maker leaves the trading crowd for more than ``a brief interval.'' The Regulatory Circular interprets
``a brief interval'' to mean ``five consecutive minutes.'' Under this interpretation any market maker who signs
onto RAES at a particular trading station during a trading session must log off the system prior to leaving that station
for more than five consecutive minutes. The CBOE believes that this interpretation should eliminate ambiguity about
the amount of time a market maker may be away from the trading crowd without signing off RAES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Regulatory Circular notes that graduated fees will be assessed under CBOE Rules 8.16(a) and 24.16(a)
for failures to observe the RAES log-off requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the Regulatory Circular reflects the MPC's designation pursuant to CBOE Rules 8.16(b) and 24.16(b) that the
expiration month log-on requirements reflected in those rules will be enforced in all classes of equity and SPX options
for which RAES is available. Accordingly, any market maker who has logged onto RAES in accordance with CBOE Rules 8.16(a)
or 24.16(a) during an expiration month for a given class of options must log on whenever present at the applicable trading
station, until the next expiration.

Fourth, the Regulatory Circular reflects a determination by the MPC, pursuant to its authority under CBOE Rules 8.16(d)
and 24.16(d), that any market maker who fails to meet the log-on requirements under CBOE Rules 8.16(b) or 24.16(b)
ordinarily will be suspended from participation on RAES at the applicable trading station for a period extending
to 21 consecutive business days.

In contrast to this suspension provision, the OEX RAES Approval Order provides that members who fail to observe the
RAES log-on requirements for OEX options are subject to a fee. The CBOE has determined that suspensions, not fees,
are the appropriate mechanisms to promote compliance with RAES log-on requirements for equity and SPX options. The
CBOE states that it may introduce fees for failures to observe the log-on requirements for equity and SPX options at
a later date if experience so dictates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to enable the CBOE to enforce compliance with
the Act, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest by assuring
that equity and SPX options market makers are aware of and meet their responsibilities pertaining to RAES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) in that it is designed to facilitate transactions in securities and to protect investors and the public interest.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that the graduated fee schedule for failures to comply with the RAES log-off requirements
and the imposition of suspensions for failures to meet the RAES log-on requirements established in CBOE Rules 8.16(b)
and 24.16(b) are designed to maintain the integrity of the RAES system for equity and SPX options. The fees and suspensions,
together with the provision specifying that a market maker must log off RAES when leaving the trading crowd for more
than ``a brief interval'' of five minutes, are designed to ensure that there is adequate market maker participation
at all times in SPX and equity RAES and that market makers are properly logged on to the system. The presence of an adequate
number of market makers protects investors and contributes to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets by helping
the Exchange to maintain the continued availability of RAES for SPX and equity options, thereby contributing to the
effective and efficient execution of public investor orders at the best available prices.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Commission believes that the proposed Regulatory Circular should facilitate compliance with SPX
and equity RAES requirements by explaining market makers' RAES log-on and log-off requirements and the fees and suspensions
provided for failures to satisfy those requirements. The Commission also believes that the graduated fee schedule
should encourage compliance with the log-off requirements and may increase the Exchange's ability to deter repeat
offenders. Likewise, the Commission believes that the provision establishing suspensions for failures to comply
with the RAES log-on requirements should deter participating market makers from abandoning their commitment to
RAES for other than good cause.

The Commission notes that under CBOE Rules 8.16 and 34.16 the CBOE retains the discretion to bring full disciplinary
proceedings. The Commission expects the CBOE to bring full disciplinary proceedings where appropriate, for example,
in cases of egregious or repeated violations of the SPX and equity RAES requirements.

Finally, the Commission believes, as it has concluded in the past,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 that the right to appeal the fees and suspensions imposed under the proposal pursuant to Chapter XIX of the CBOE's rules
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 should help to safeguard the procedural rights to SPX and equity RAES participants. In addition, the Commission believes
that the CBOE's Regulatory Circular should help to safeguard the procedural rights of SPX and equity RAES participants
by providing them with additional notification and clarification of their RAES log-on and log-off responsibilities.

In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Exchange to list and trade cash-settled European-style
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 index options on the Emerging Markets Index. The Index will initially consist of 25 closed-end funds which invest
in the stocks of firms in the emerging Asian and Latin American economies. According to the Exchange, no proxy for the
performance of these emerging economies is currently available in the U.S. derivatives markets. The Exchange believes,
therefore, that options on the Index will provide investors with a low-cost means of participating in the performance
of these markets and/or hedging against the risk of investing in the Asian and Latin American emerging markets.

The components of the Index are the: Asia Pacific Fund; Asia Tigers Fund Inc.; China Fund Inc.; Greater China Fund Inc.;
Jardine Fleming China Region Fund Inc.; Morgan Stanley India Fund; Indonesia Fund Inc.; Jakarta Growth Fund Inc.;
Korea Fund Inc.; Korea Equity Fund Inc.; Malaysia Fund Inc.; First Philippine Fund Inc.; Singapore Fund Inc.; ROC

As of June 15, 1994, the closed-end funds comprising the Index ranged in market capitalization from a low of $49.4 million
to a high of $1.146 billion. The average capitalization as of that date was $146 million. The closed-end fund accounting
for the largest percentage of the total weighting of the Index on that date was the Chile Fund Inc. (9.07%), while the
smallest was the Korea Equity Fund Inc. (1.98%).

Calculation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index is price-weighted and reflects changes in the prices of the components relative to the base date of December
31, 1991. The Index value is calculated by summing the prices of the component securities and then dividing by a divisor
that yielded an index value of 100.00 as of that date. The value of the Index at the close on June 15, 1994, was 151.69.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Index will be calculated by CBOE or its designee on a real-time basis using last-sale prices and will be disseminated
every 15 seconds by the Exchange. If a component closed-end fund is not currently being traded, the most recent price
at which the closed-end fund traded will be used in the Index calculation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Maintenance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index will be maintained by the Exchange. To maintain continuity in the Index following an adjustment to a component
security, the divisor will be adjusted. Changes which may result in divisor changes include, but are not limited to,
certain rights issuances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange states that the Index will be reviewed on approximately a monthly basis by the CBOE staff. The Exchange
may change the composition of the Index at any time or from time to time to reflect the changes affecting the components
of the Index or the emerging Asian and Latin American markets generally. If it becomes necessary to remove a component
from the Index, every effort will be made to add a closed-end fund that preserves the character of the Index. In such
circumstances, the CBOE will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition
of the proposed replacement closed-end fund. The Exchange will most likely maintain 25 closed-end funds in the Index
at all times.

Long-Term Index Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to Index options on the full-value of the Index, the Exchange also proposes to list long-term Index option
series (``LEAPS'') as provided in CBOE Rule 24.9, and reduced-value Index LEAPS for which the underlying value would
be computed at one-tenth (1/10) of the value of the Index. The current and closing Index value of any such reduced-value
Index LEAPS will, after such initial computation, be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. Other than the reduced
value, all other specifications and calculations for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will remain the same.

Index options will have European-style exercise and will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' within the meaning of
the rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's rules.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 24.9 to refer specifically to Emerging Markets Index options. The Exchange states
that the proposed Index options would expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus,
the last day for trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the
expiration date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as modified in the proposal, the Rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's Rules regarding narrow-based indexes
will be applicable to Index options.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Pursuant to Exchange Rule 24.4A, Index option contracts based on the Emerging Markets Index will be subject to the
position limits of 10,500 contracts.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 For purposes of position and exercise limits, Index LEAPS will be aggregated with Index options on a one for one basis.
Under the proposal, ten reduced-value Index LEAPS contracts will equal one full-value Index option or Index LEAP
for purposes of aggregating positions. The Exchange represents that it has the necessary systems capacity to support
new options series that would result from the introduction of Index options and Index LEAPS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Exchange to list and trade cash-settled, European-style
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 index options on the Emerging Asian Markets Index. The Index will initially consist of 16 closed-end funds which invest
in the stocks of firms in the emerging Asian economies. According to the Exchange, no proxy for the performance of these
emerging economies is currently available in the U.S. derivatives markets. The Exchange believes, therefore, that
options on the Index will provide investors with a low-cost means of participating in the performance of these markets
and/or hedging against the risk of investing in the Asian emerging markets.

The Emerging Asian Markets Index will initially consist of 16 closed-end funds.

 All of the closed-end fund components of the Index currently trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

The components of the Index are the: Asia Pacific Fund; Asia Tigers Fund Inc.; China Fund Inc.; Greater China Fund Inc.;
Jardine Fleming China Region Fund Inc.; Morgan Stanley India Fund; Indonesia Fund Inc.; Jarkarta Growth Fund Inc.;
Korea Fund Inc.; Korea Equity Fund Inc.; Malaysia Fund Inc.; First Philippine Fund Inc.; Singapore Fund Inc.; ROC

As of June 15, 1994, the closed-end funds comprising the Index ranged in market capitalization from a low of $49.4 million
to a high of $589.4 million. The average capitalization as of that date was $214.5 million. The closed-end fund accounting
for the largest percentage of the total weighting of the Index on that date was the Thai Fund Inc. (10.60%), while the
smallest was the Jakarta Growth Fund Inc. (3.52%).

Calculation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index is price-weighted and reflects changes in the prices of the components relative to the base date of December
31, 1991. The Index value is calculated by summing the prices of the component securities and then dividing by a divisor
that yielded an index value of 100.00 as of that date. The value of the Index at the close on June 15, 1994, was 155.07.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Index will be calculated by CBOE or its designee on a real-time basis using last-sale prices and will be disseminated
every 15 seconds by the Exchange. If a component closed-end fund is not currently being traded, the most recent price
at which the closed-end fund traded will be used in the Index calculation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Maintenance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index will be maintained by the Exchange. To maintain continuity in the Index following an adjustment to a component
security, the divisor will be adjusted. Changes which may result in divisor changes include, but are not limited to,
certain rights issuances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange states that the index will be reviewed on approximately a monthly basis by the CBOE staff. The Exchange
may change the composition of the Index at any time or from time to time to reflect the changes affecting the components
of the Index or the emerging Asian markets generally. If it becomes necessary to remove a component from the Index,
every effort will be made to add a closed-end fund that preserves the character of the Index. In such circumstances,
the CBOE will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition of the proposed
replacement closed-end fund. The Exchange will most likely maintain 16 closed-end funds in the Index at all times.

Long-Term Index Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to Index options on the full-value of the Index, the Exchange also proposes to list long-term Index option
series (``LEAPS'') as provided in CBOE Rule 24.9, and reduced-value Index LEAPS of which the underlying value would
be computed at one-tenth (1/10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
th
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of the value of the Index. The current and closing Index value of any such reduced-value Index LEAPS will, after such
initial computation, be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. Other than the reduced value, all other specifications
and calculations for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will remain the same.

Index options will have European-style exercise and will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' within the meaning of
the rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's rules.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 24.9 to refer specifically to Emerging Asian Markets Index options. The Exchange states
that the proposed Index options would expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus,
the last day for trading in a expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the
expiration date.

Except as modified in the proposal, the Rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's Rules regarding narrow-based index
will be applicable to Index options.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Pursuant to Exchange rule 24.4A, Index option contracts based on the Emerging Asian Markets Index will be subject
to position limits of 10,500 contracts.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 For purposes of position and exercise limits, Index LEAPS will be aggregated with Index options on a one for one basis.
Under the proposal, ten reduced-value Index LEAP contracts will equal one full-value Index option or Index LEAP for
purposes of aggregating positions. The Exchange represents that it has the necessary systems capacity to support
new options series that would result from the introduction of Index options and Index LEAPS.

the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 in particular, in that it will provide investors with an opportunity to invest in options based upon the Emerging Asian
Markets Index pursuant to rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just

in securities, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and protect investors and

The proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1, was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 34379 (July 14, 1994), 59 FR 37110 (July 20, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves
the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CHX's Board of Governors (``Board'') is responsible for managing the business of the Exchange and is vested with
all the powers necessary for the government of the Exchange, the regulation of the business conduct of members and
member organizations and the promotion of the welfare, objects and purposes of the Exchange.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Currently, the Board consists of twenty-four elected Governors, plus the Vice Chairman of the Board and the President
of the Exchange.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Of the twenty-four Governors, sixteen must be members, general partners of member firms or officers of member corporations
(``member Governors''); and eight must be unaffiliated with the Exchange or any broker-dealer in securities (``non-member
Governors'').
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The CHX Constitution also requires that nine of the sixteen member Governors be from the Chicago area, at least three
of whom must be active on the floor of the Exchange, and that seven member Governors be from outside the Chicago area.

In terms of their qualifications, participant Governors must have securities clearance and/or settlement expertise,
background or responsibilities. To ensure that floor members are not over-represented on the Board, the Exchange

Finally, the Exchange proposes to allow a participant Governor to be re-categorized as a member Governor, or a member
Governor to be re-categorized as a participant Governor, so long as both positions are within the same class.

 notes 6 and 14. According to the Exchange, the President will recommend and the Board (or Executive Committee) must

rule change, the recategorization provision mainly will be used to help fill vacancies on the Board. Telephone conversation
between David T. Rusoff, Attorney, Foley &amp; Lardner, and Beth A. Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation,

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the CHX, the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Sections 6(b)(1), 6(b)(3) and 6(b)(5) of
the Act. Section 6(b)(1) of the Act requires that an exchange be organized and have the capacity to carry out the purposes
of the Act and to comply, and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members, with the
Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange. Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires that the
rules of an exchange assure the fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration
of its affairs and provide that one or more directors represent issuers and investors and not be associated with a member
of the exchange or a broker-dealer. Finally, Section 6(b)(5) of the Act requires, among other things, that the rules
of an exchange be designed, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

In the Commission's opinion, changes in the composition of the board of governors of a national securities exchange
typically raise difficult regulatory issues, due to the board's special role and responsibilities in managing the
business of an exchange and in ensuring that the exchange fulfills its obligations under the Act.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, before the Commission can approve a proposed board reorganization, the Commission must be satisfied
that all exchange constituencies, including the public, are fairly represented in its governance.

After careful review, the Commission believes that the CHX proposal should allow the Exchange and its subsidiaries
to operate more efficiently. In addition, the Commission has concluded that the proposed rule change strikes an appropriate
balance between the various constituencies of the CHX
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 and, therefore, is consistent with the Act's requirements. The Commission's reasons for reaching these conclusions
are set forth in more detail below.

The Commission recognizes that the CHX and its clearing corporation and trust company subsidiaries generally are
viewed as parts of one ``Exchange complex.'' Among other things, the CHX, MCC and MSTC share certain facilities, systems
and financial services.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 Under the current governance structure, however, the CHX has found that having different Governors serve on the Board
of each organization can complicate strategic planning for the ``complex'' and may create certain inefficiencies
in the development and implementation of policy.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 In order to address these issues, the proposed rule change will enable the same individuals to serve on the Board of
the CHX and its subsidiaries.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission therefore believes that the CHX proposal should foster greater coordination in decision making among
the Exchange, MCC and MSTC.

<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission has concluded that, as a practical matter, the proposed rule change should maintain
existing levels of public participation on the CHX Board and should prevent floor domination of the governance of
the Exchange.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, although the Commission would be concerned by a significant increase in the proportion of securities professionals
on an exchange's board, the Commission does not believe that the CHX proposal favors professionals at the expense
of the public. The Commission notes that the CHX Board presently consists of sixteen member (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, industry) Governors and eight non-members (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, public) Governors. As amended, four participant Governors and one non-member Governor will be added to the Board,
for a total of twenty industry and nine public representatives. On that basis, the Commission agrees with the Exchange's
argument that the proposed rule change will, in effect, maintain the current balance between those constituencies.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission therefore finds that the CHX proposal is consistent with the fair representation and the protection
of investors and the public interest.

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
24
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed reorganization, public Governors will constitute 31% of the CHX Board, as opposed to 33% of the
existing Board, which is a minor change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, based on certain commitments made by the CHX, the Commission is satisfied that the proposed rule change
will not be used as an indirect means to achieve floor domination of the Board. The Commission recognizes that many
MCC or MSTC participants are also CHX members and, in that capacity, may be active on the floor of the Exchange. Due to
the Commission's long-standing concerns, Exchange management has committed to use its best efforts to ensure that
the participant Governor positions will not be filled by floor members upon implementation of the proposed rule change
or in the future.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that these commitments should be sufficient to prevent floor members' interests from being
over-represented in the governance of the Exchange. Finally, although the proposal will allow Governors to be recategorized,
the Commission expects the CHX to exercise its discretion in a manner which is consistent with the above commitments.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 On the conditions set forth above, the Commission is satisfied that the Board composition should be sufficiently
diverse for it to carry out its obligations under the Act.

According to the CHX, because both positions must be in the same class, see supra

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1, prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of the notice of filing thereof. The CHX proposal is designed to achieve a more coherent
governance structure while maintaining fair representation of Exchange constituencies and protecting investors
and the public interest. Accelerated approval thereof will allow these benefits to be realized as soon as possible.
In addition, the proposed rule change was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the full statutory period and no comments were received on any aspect of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,

 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;94&hyph;15), including Amendment No. 1, is approved on an accelerated

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on August 1, 1994, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and
III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this
notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

The percentage of a non-preferencing member firm's total monthly CSE trade activity which consists of ITS inbound
executions shall equal or exceed the average percentage achieved by preferencing Designated Dealers that manually
enter quotations. If there exist no preferencing Dealers on CSE that are manually entering quotations, then the percentage
of a non-preferencing member firm's total monthly CSE trade activity which consists of ITS inbound executions shall
equal at least 5%. For the purpose of comparing ITS inbound activity, a rolling three-month average will be used to
derive the percentage for the DDs entering manual quotations and these will be compared to the next month's percentages
achieved by those member firms using computer-generated quotations.

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
On February 25, 1994, the CSE filed proposed changes to its quality of markets policy.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal calls for the elimination of autoquoting and the adoption of objective standards to ensure that CSE specialists
are contributing to the national market system. In response to comments on the filing, the Exchange proposes to amend
one component of its new policy, the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') inbound execution requirement. Specifically,
the requirement, as amended, would require that all Designated Dealers who computer-generate their quotations,
whether or not they preference order flow, generate the same percentage of ITS inbound activity as preferencing Designated
Dealers who manually generate quotes. The Exchange believes that such an approach would more fairly allocate the
burden of improved performance across all of its specialists.

The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., operates The PORTAL Market for the quotation of securities that are restricted securities,
as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), or are securities that are treated
as if restricted.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In order to qualify for inclusion in The PORTAL Market, a security that is restricted or treated as if restricted must
be eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 be in negotiable form, and be assigned a CUSIP or other security identification number that is different from any identification
number assigned to any unrestricted securities of the same class. Designation of a security as a PORTAL security permits
the security to be assigned a CUSIP number by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation and be cleared and settled through
the Depository Trust Company.

Part II, PORTAL Rules, provides that to qualify for initial designation and continued designation in the PORTAL Market,
a security shall be either a restricted security, as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, or a security
that upon issuance and continually thereafter only can be sold pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act,
Rule 144A, or Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or sold in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4 and not involving any public offering.

Pursuant to section 2 of the PORTAL Rules, any PORTAL participant may submit an application for security designation.
``PORTAL participants'' include PORTAL dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL investors. The first two categories
of PORTAL participants are required to be brokers and dealers registered with the Commission under Section 15 of the
Exchange Act and members of the NASD. The third category of PORTAL participants are institutional investors that
are not members of the NASD that meet the definition of ``qualified institutional buyer'' under Rule 144A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PORTAL Market has processed over one thousand applications for designation as a PORTAL security. The NASD has
operated The PORTAL Market since its initiation June 1990 without the imposition of any fees on users. Under the present
proposal, the NASD will adopt a filing fee of $2,000 per security application submitted plus $200 for each security
identification symbol assigned after the first symbol. The fee for each security identification symbol is being
established because many private offerings involve securities that are sold in multiple tranches, each of which
is treated as a separate security that is assigned a separate identification symbol, even though they are part of a
single private offering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes the imposition of a PORTAL filing fee will assist The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. to cover continuing
costs associated with the operation of The PORTAL Market, including significant costs associated with the processing
of security applications. The processing of security applications for The PORTAL Market requires an immediate review
of all applications, as private placements are usually on a very short time schedule. Such review must ensure that
the security meets all of the requirements in Part II of The PORTAL Rules, as discussed above. Given the efforts required
by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. staff, the NASD believes that the fees as proposed are appropriate.

III. Commission's Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the
Exchange Act,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 which requires that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the Association operates
or controls. The Commission believes that the proposed rule change equitably applies a filing fee to all applications
submitted by PORTAL dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL qualified investors for the designation of securities in
The PORTAL Market. The Commission believes the imposition of a PORTAL filing fee is reasonable in that it should assist
The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., in covering continuing costs associated with the operation of The PORTAL Market, including
significant costs associated with the processing of security applications for the The PORTAL Market.

On March 15, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>

The rule change substitutes the word ``subsidiary'' for the term ``affiliate'' in Commentaries .10 through .25 in
Rule 321.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34301 (July 1, 1994),59
FR 35162 (July 8, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, NYSE Rule 321 requires a member or member organization to obtain Exchange approval for the formation or
acquisition of an affiliated company. The term ``affiliate'' is defined in NYSE Rule 321.10 as ``an entity engaged
in a securities, or kindred business that is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
controlled by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a member or member organization'' (emphasis added). The Exchange is amending NYSE Rule 321, as well as Rules 113 and
122 (that refer to an affiliate within the meaning of Rule 321), by substituting the term ``subsidiary'' for the term
``affiliate.'' The Exchange believes that this non-substantive change will minimize confusion and avoid potential
problems which could arise as a result of differing definitions of the term ``affiliate'' and clarify that the Rules
do not apply to parent or sister companies.

For example, the Act defines an ``affiliate'' as ``a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
controls 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified'' (emphasis added). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Exchange is amending the definition of ``control'' for purposes of NYSE Rule 321.10. Currently,
control is presumed if a member or member organization owns 25% or more of the voting securities of an entity or is entitled
to receive 25% or more of the net profits. Under NYSE Rule 2, however, control would also be presumed if an associated
person is a director, general partner or principal executive officer or another entity.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange believes it is appropriate to include general partner status in the presumption of control for purposes
of Rule 321.10.

Under NYSE Rule 2, a person is presumed to control another person if such person directly or indirectly; (1) has the
right to vote 25 percent or more of the voting securities, (2) is entitled to receive 25 percent or more of the net profits,
or (3) is a director, general partner or principal executive officer (or persons occupying a similar status or performing
similar functions) of the other person.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, the Commission believes substituting the term ``subsidiary'' for the term ``affiliate'' is a non-substantive
change that will clarify to members which formations or acquisitions require prior Exchange approval under NYSE
Rule 321. In addition, the Commission believes that including general partner status in the presumption of control
for purposes of NYSE Rule 321 is consistent with other Exchange Rules and will facilitate Exchange oversight of functionally
equivalent transactions.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on July 9, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Section 9&hyph;1, ``Trustees of Stock Exchange Fund_How Appointed'' of Article IX, ``Trustees of Stock
Exchange Fund'' of the Exchange's By-Laws requires that the trustees of the Stock Exchange Fund (``Fund'') include
the Chairman of the Exchange's Board of Governors, two Vice Chairmen of the Board of Governors and up to five other Exchange
members, all of whom are appointed by the Exchange's Board of Governors and serve for three years or until a successor
is appointed. The PHLX proposes to amend Section 9&hyph;1 to allow two members of the Exchange's Board of Governors,
rather than two Vice Chairmen, to serve as trustees of the Fund and to allow qualified non-members to serve as trustees.
In addition, the PHLX proposes to amend Section 10&hyph;13, ``Executive Committee,'' of By-Law Article X, ``Standing
Committees,'' to delete the requirement that the Executive Vice President of the Exchange serve on the Exchange's
Executive Committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PHLX states that the proposal to amend By-Law Article IX, Section 9&hyph;1 will give the Exchange's Board of Governors
more flexibility in choosing trustees of the Fund by eliminating the requirement that all trustees be Exchange members
or affiliated with member organizations. Under the proposal, the Board of Governors will be able to choose qualified
persons with investment management expertise regardless of their status respecting Exchange membership or affiliation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will also eliminate the requirement that the Exchange's Vice Chairmen serve as Fund trustees,
to ease the administrative burdens currently imposed upon the Vice Chairmen. The proposal retains the Board of Governors'
oversight of the trustees by continuing to require the Chairman of the Board of Governors to be a trustee and by imposing
a new requirement that two other members of the Board of Governors be trustees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment to By-Law Article X, Section 10&hyph;13 deletes the Executive Vice President of the PHLX from
membership on the Exchange's Executive Committee. The PHLX states that the Exchange's management will continue
to be represented on the Executive Committee by the Exchange's President and Chief Executive Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PHLX believes that the proposal is consistent with section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular with Section
6(b)(3), in that it is designed to assure a fair representation of the Exchange's members in the administration of
its affairs and to provide that one or more Fund trustees may be representatives not associated with a member of the
Exchange.

Consolidated Natural Gas Company (``CNG''), a registered holding company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary company,
CNG Financial Services, Inc. (``CNGF''), both located at CNG Tower, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
15222&hyph;3199, have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 12(c), and 13 of

CNG and CNGF request authorization, through December 31, 1998, for CNGF to finance the purchase of certain gas utilizing
equipment (``Gas Equipment'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 by creditworthy customers who purchase or may be expected to purchase gas directly or indirectly from location distribution
companies (``LDCs'') of the CNG System.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, CNG seeks authorization to provide CNGF with up to an aggregate of $25 million in funds, on a revolving
basis, through December 31, 1998, to enable CNGF to make Gas Equipment financing loans to such customers. CNGF may
obtain funds from GNG through this date by (1) selling CNGF common stock, $10,000 par value, to CNG; and/or (2) obtaining
open account advances from CNG; and/or (3) obtaining long-term loans from CNG.

The Gas Equipment to be financed would fall into one or more of the following categories: (1) Standard Gas Appliances_the
type of standard gas appliances contemplated by Rule 48, including such gas equipment as ranges, dryers, waterheaters
and furnaces; (2) New Technology Equipment_gas equipment marketed to promote new or unfamiliar technology that
uses gas as a fuel (which could include equipment using existing technology designed for a new application), such
as gas heat pumps, gas air conditioning and gas turbines; (3) Alternate Fuel Equipment_gas equipment that enables
an end-user to use natural gas as an alternative to another fuel; such equipment would include both conversion equipment
necessary to convert non-gas utilizing equipment to equipment that can use gas as a fuel (e.g., energy connective
apparatus enabling a coal-burning boiler to use gas as a fuel) and gas utilizing equipment that is manufactured and
sold as a complete indivisible unit (e.g., compact gas generators).

Open account advances made to CNGF will be made by book entry only, not evidenced by short-term notes, and will bear
the same interest rate as open account advances made to participants in the CNG System Money Pool, a rate equal to the
effective weighted average rate of interest on CNG's commercial paper and/or revolving credit borrowing. All such
advances will be payable on demand and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. Long-term loans to CNGF
will be evidenced by long-term non-negotiable notes (which may be book entry) of CNGF maturing over a period of time
to be determined by the officers of CNG, with the interest predicated on and substantially equal to CNG's cost of funds
for comparable borrowings by CNG. In the event that CNG has not had recent comparable borrowings, the rates will be
tied to the Solomon Brothers, Inc. Bond Market Roundup, or to a comparable rate index, on the date nearest to the time
of takedown. All such loans may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty.

CNG states that it will obtain the funds it loans to CNGF through internal cash generation, issuance of long-term debt
securities as authorized by Commission orders dated April 21, 1993 (HCAR No. 25800) and April 14, 1994 (HCAR No. 26026),
borrowings under a credit agreement, as authorized by Commission orders dated March 28, 1991 (HCAR No. 25283) and
September 9, 1992 (HCAR No. 25626), or through other authorizations approved or to be approved by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants also seek authorization for CNGF, from time to time through December 31, 1998, to purchase, at par from
CNG, shares of CNGF's $10,000 par value common stock previously sold to CNG to obtain funds, as described above, to
hold such reacquired shares as treasury shares and to resell such shares to CNG at par.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants state that customers receiving loans (``Financing Customers'') will come primarily from the commercial
and/or industrial sectors and will result mainly from contacts between CNG System LDCs and their end-use customers.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 CNGF proposes to conduct its Gas Equipment financing activities both within and outside of the four states of Virginia,
West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio where the CNG System LDC's are located (collectively, ``LDC States''). However,
applicants state that during the twelve-month period beginning on the first day of January in the year following the
date CNGF commences Gas Equipment financing activities pursuant to a Commission order issued in this matter, and
for each subsequent calendar year thereafter, total revenues of CNGF derived from Gas Equipment financing activities
in the LDC States will exceed total revenues of CNGF derived from Gas Equipment financing activities in all other states.

CNGF will provide Gas Equipment financing to Financing Customers by (1) making short-term loans to cover the period
of installation of the Gas Equipment until permanent financing can be obtained by the customer, or (2) making long-term
loans for a period of time not to exceed the lesser of 10 years or the expected useful life of the equipment. The aggregate
amount of Gas Equipment financing loans by CNGF outstanding at any one time will not exceed $25,000,000, with an individual
customer financing limit of $5,000,000 at any one time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Loans to Financing Customers may be secured or unsecured and will be made at a spread above the cost of funds from CNG
in order to cover CNGF's costs and earn a return on its capital. CNGF does not have any full-time employees, and applicants
expect CNGF to obtain accounting, credit, financial, management, marketing, operating, technical and clerical
support, at cost, from CNG Service Company (``Service Company'') pursuant to a written service agreement.

Applicants propose to organize and to invest in certain entities for the purpose of engaging in international business
activities that may arise from time to time (``Business Activities''). The Business Activities will include forming,
acquiring, financing and owning the securities or interests in the business of exempt wholesale generators, as defined
in Section 32(e) of the Act (``EWG'') and foreign utility companies, as defined in Section 33(a) of the Act (``FUCO'')
(collectively with EWGs and FUCOs, ``Facilities''). The EWGs will develop, construct, own and operate electric
generating assets and the FUCOs will develop, construct, own and operate electric generation, transmission and
distribution assets (``E/F Activities''). CSW proposes to organize, form, acquire and fund subsidiary companies
(``Project Parents'') that would engage in E/F Activities, and for Project Parents to issue equity and debt securities
to third parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Business Activities will also consist of providing consulting services, including, but not limited to, designing,
constructing and engineering services, to foreign electric utility enterprises and Facilities in which CSW has
no ownership interest (collectively, with E/F Activities, ``Permitted Activities''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSW proposes to organize and to invest in a direct, wholly owned subsidiary company, which is anticipated to be named
CSW International, Inc. (``CSWI''). In addition, Applicants propose for CSWI and Energy to organize and to invest
in a subsidiary company, which will be organized and to invest in a subsidiary company, which will be organized under
the laws of the United Mexican States and is anticipated to be named CSW de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (``CSWdM''). Upon formation,
CSWI and CSWdM propose to organize and to invest in a subsidiary company, which will be organized under the laws of the
United Mexican States and is anticipated to be named CSW de Mexico Servicios, S.A. de C.V. (``CSWdM Servicios'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants propose to organize CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios in the following manner: (1) CSWI will be organized
under the laws of the State of Delaware with an authorized share capital of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01
per share; (2) CSWdM will be organized under the laws of the United Mexican States with an authorized share capital
of up to 10,000 shares of common stock, par value NP$5.00 per share; and (3) CSWdM Servicios will be organized under
the laws of the United Mexican States with an authorized share capital of up to 10,000 shares of common stock, par value
NP$5.00 per share. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSW will initially subscribe to 1,000 shares of CSWI's authorized and issued common stock, at a subscription price
of $1.00 per share. CSWI will initially subscribe to 9,999 shares of CSWdM common stock at a subscription price of NP$5.00
per share, and Energy will initially subscribe to one share of CSWdM common stock at a subscription price of NP$5.00
per share. CSWI and Energy will thus own all authorized and issued shares of CSWdM. CSWdM will initially subscribe
to 9,999 shares of CSWdM Servicios common stock at a subscription price of NP$5.00 per share, and CSWI will initially
subscribe to one share of CSWdM Servicios common stock at a subscription price of NP$5.00 per share. CSWI and CSWdM
will thus own all authorized and issued shares of CSWdM Servicios. Energy will hold directly one share in CSWdM, and
CSWI will hold directly one share in CSWdM Servicios, to comply with the requirement under Mexican law that each of
CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios has a minimum of two shareholders. In the event any company in the CSW System is to acquire
an interest in CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios (other than as set forth above), appropriate Commission approval will
be requested.

The Applicants assert that the purpose of this structure is to: (1) localize management of domestic and foreign office
staffs; (2) operate domestic and foreign business activities efficiently; (3) limit liability (domestic and foreign);
(4) minimize taxes, both domestic and foreign; and (5) increase flexibility to respond to foreign business opportunities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSWI will engage exclusively in Permitted Activities by serving as a holding company for CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios and
Project Parents. CSWdM anticipates engaging in Permitted Activities primarily in Mexico. However, CSWdM may also
engage in Permitted Activities in other foreign countries through joint ventures with third parties (``Joint Ventures'').
The nature of the independent power market in Mexico is such that CSWdM's nonaffiliate Mexican entity partner(s)
in a Joint Venture may seek to have such Joint Venture engage in Permitted Activities in a foreign country other than
Mexico. It is, therefore, desirable that CSWdM, in order to attract Joint Venture partners, have the authority, directly
or indirectly, to engage in Permitted Activities in foreign countries other than Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSWdM Servicios will provide services to CSWdM and Project Parents that shall conduct Permitted Activities outside
of the United States. Such services shall include management, administrative, employment, tax, accounting, engineering,
consulting, utility performance and electronic data processing services and software development and support
services in connection therewith. CSWdM Servicios will provide localized management of Mexican employees, increased
efficiency from a consolidated foreign office staff and a vehicle to insulate CSW and its affiliates from tax, labor
and other liabilities that may apply under Mexican law. CSWdM Servicios will not provide services to any subsidiary
company or affiliate of CSW other than CSWdM, CSWI, their subsidiary companies or Project Parents that shall conduct
Permitted Activities outside the United States, without prior Commission approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project Parents will engage in E/F Activities and be special purpose domestic corporations, partnerships or limited
liability companies or foreign corporations, partnerships or limited liability companies (or the equivalent thereof),
and will include Joint Venture(s) engaged in E/F Activities. CSW's experience, in connection with its foreign project
development activities to date, including the preparation and submission of bids in connection with foreign government
energy privatization programs, is that the organization, formation or acquisition of one or more Project Parents
is necessary or desirable to facilitate E/F Activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A holding structure of one or more Project Parents may be necessary to minimize foreign and domestic tax liabilities
(e.g., by deferring repatriation of foreign source income, or in order to take full advantage of favorable tax treaties
among foreign countries). Project Parents may be necessary or desirable for bidding on FUCOs or EWGs through Joint
Ventures, since each member of the Joint Venture will typically want to have at least one consolidated subsidiary
in the final FUCO or EWG ownership structure for tax and accounting purposes. Project Parents would insulate CSW,
CSWI and CSWdM from certain business, tax and labor risks and facilitate subsequent adjustments to or sales of interests
among or by the members of such Joint Venture. A Project Parent may also acquire and hold direct or indirect interests
in both FUCOs and EWGs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any such indirect investment by CSW in any Project Parent would be consummated only if, at the time thereof and after
giving effect thereto, CSW's ``aggregate investment,'' determined in accordance with Rule 53(a)(1)(i), in all
FUCOs, EWGs and Project Parents would not exceed 50% of CSW's ``consolidated retained earnings,'' as defined in Rule
53(a)(1)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments by CSW, CSWI or CSWdM, directly or indirectly, in any Project Parent may take the form of any combination
of acquisition of capital shares, partnership interests, trust certificates or the equivalent of any of the foregoing
under the laws of foreign jurisdictions, if applicable. Any investment in the capital shares or other equity securities
of a Project Parent that have a stated par value will be in an amount equal to or greater than such par value. Any investment
in any particular Project Parent would be limited to an amount no greater than the amount reasonably required in connection
with making the underlying investment in any FUCO and/or EWG with respect to which such Project Parent was organized,
taking into account development expenditures, working capital needs and cash reserves required to be maintained
in accordance with any financing document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within 45 days after CSW, CSWI or CSWdM determines that the purpose for owning any Project Parent no longer exists,
it shall liquidate, dissolve or sell such Project Parent, unless, within that time-period, CSW, CSWI or CSWdM, as
the case may be, determines that such Project Parent may be used in connection with a proposal or plan to develop or acquire
an interest in a different FUCO or EWG. The Applicants request authority to liquidate, dissolve or sell any Project
Parent under such circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios propose to enter into agreements with CSW Services and Energy concerning services
to be provided in connection with the Permitted Activities. CSW Services and Energy will initially provide services
necessary or desirable for the operation of CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios. CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios will
not provide services to any subsidiary of CSW other than Energy, themselves and their subsidiary companies.

In addition, CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios may from time to time require the services of certain employees of the
Central Power and Light, Company, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, Southwestern Electric Power Company and West
Texas Utilities Company (collectively, ``Operating Subsidiaries'') in connection with Permitted Activities.
Certain employees of the Operating Subsidiaries are fluent in languages other than English or knowledgeable in the
operation of Facilities, which may be necessary or desirable skills for CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios to demonstrate
in connection with the Permitted Activities. However, the necessity or desirability of such skills does not economically
justify hiring employees of CSWI, CSWdM and/or CSWdM Servicios with such skills during the commencement of activities
at such companies. Accordingly, the Applicants seek authority for the Operating Subsidiaries to provide such services
to CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Services.

any one time, directly or indirectly, to CSWI, CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios or any EWG or FUCO held directly or indirectly
by CSW. The accounting by the CSW system of such services will ensure that CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios, as the case
may be, will be obligated to reimburse the appropriate Operating Subsidiary for such services. In no event will the
provision of such services adversely affect the rate base or the costs to ratepayers of any such Operating Subsidiary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost of services provided by an Operating Subsidiary to CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios will include all direct
charges based on the wage rates or salaries of assigned employees (including direct labor costs and direct labor benefits;
costs of material, vehicle and equipment usage; and meals, lodging and miscellaneous expenses) and indirect or overhead
costs including insurance, employment taxes, benefits plans (if applicable) and a portion of the administrative
and general expenses of such Operating Subsidiary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All services rendered by an Operating Subsidiary to CSWI, CSWdM Or CSWdM Servicios will be performed in accordance
with a work order which sets forth the services requested and time allocated for such services. No Operating Subsidiary
shall be obligated to render services to CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios if the personnel and resources needed to fill
the work order are not available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There will be no diversion of CSW system personnel or resources that would adversely affect any operating subsidiary's
domestic ratepayers or CSW's shareholders. CSWI will report to the Commission the nature and scope of such services
provided by any Operating Subsidiary, CSW Services and Energy to CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios, including a quarterly
summary of the type and cost of any services furnished by such associates. Such reports will represent that no such
associate has subsidized the operations of CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios, and, further, that the transfer of any
personnel from, and the rendering of services by, such associates in connection with Permitted Activities have not
adversely affected the services provided by such associates to their respective customers.

CSW proposes through December 31, 1997, to: (1) finance the activities of the CSWI, CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios and Project

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Parents in the form of capital contributions, loans or open account advances (``Investments''); and/or (2) issue
guarantees in the form of letters of credit, bid bonds or other credit support to secure certain obligations incurred
by CSWI, CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios and Project Parents (``Guarantees''), in any combination of Investments and/or
Guarantees up to an aggregate principal amount of $400 million (``Aggregate General Authority''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contributions may be made from CSW to CSWI, CSWdM, CSWdM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Servicios and/or Project Parents directly or indirectly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the amount of all outstanding Guarantees and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments provided by CSW directly or indirectly to CSWI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios and/or Project Parents shall not exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Aggregate General Authority. Such Investments would bear interest at a rate per annum based on market rates for
similar credits, but in any event not in excess of CSW's weighted cost of capital and would have a final maturity not
to exceed five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants contend that in order to compete in the marketplace and to develop Facilities, CSWI, CSWdM and each Project
Parent will require the ability to bid on or otherwise pursue multiple projects on a simultaneous basis and to provide
Guarantees at the time of bid or during development. The inability of CSWI, CSWdM and/or the Project Parents to provide
such Guarantees on a timely basis will variously prevent, hinder or make more costly their participation in Facilities
for which it would otherwise be able to secure contracts.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The terms of, and any fees or interest payable in respect of, Guarantees will be established at arm's length in conformity
with market practice; provided that the cost of Guarantees (including interest on outstanding reimbursement obligations
in respect of Guarantees) provided by CSW to or for the benefit of CSWI, CSWdM or any Project Parent will not exceed CSW's
weighted cost of capital; provided further that the fees with respect to any Guarantee would not exceed 2% per annum
of the face amount of such Guarantee, and the interest payable per annum on the unreimbursed drawings under any Guarantee
would not exceed the prime rate of the issuer plus six percentage points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments and, if necessary, the payment of the Guarantees shall be funded through third party financing. CSW,
CSWI, CSWdM and each Project Parent request authority to finance the Investment in Facilities or, if necessary, to
fund the payment of Guarantees through the issuance from time to time of stock, promissory notes, commercial paper
or other debt or equity securities to third parties, including, without limitation, banks, insurance companies
and other financial institutions. The aggregate of such financing will not, when added to the Investments and Guarantees,
exceed the Aggregate General Authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equity securities issued by any Project Parent to any third party may include capital shares, partnership interests,
trust certificates or the equivalent of any of the foregoing under applicable foreign law. Debt securities issued
to third parties may include secured and unsecured promissory notes, subordinated notes, bonds or other evidence
of indebtedness. Securities issued by Project Parents may be denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies.
The amount and type of such securities, and the terms thereof, including (in the case of any indebtedness) interest
rate, maturity, prepayment or redemption privileges and the terms of any collateral security granted with respect
thereto, would be negotiated in arm's length transactions on a case by case basis, taking into account differences
from project to project in optimum debt-equity ratios, projections of earnings and cash flow, depreciation lives
and methods and other similar financial and performance characteristics of each project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the foregoing, CSW states that no equity security having a stated par value would be issued or sold
by a Project Parent for a consideration that is less than such par value. CSW also states that no note, bond or other evidence
of indebtedness issued or sold by any Project Parent will mature later than 30 years from the date of issuance thereof,
and will bear interest at a rate not in excess of the following: (1) if such note, bond or other indebtedness is U.S. dollar
denominated, at a rate not to exceed seven percent over the then applicable prime rate as announced from time to time
by Mellon Bank, N.A. (``Applicable Rate''); and (2) if such note, bond or other indebtedness is denominated in the
currency of a country other than the United States, at a rate which, when adjusted (i.e., reduced) for the prevailing
rate of inflation in such country, as reported in official indices published by such country would be equivalent to
a rate on a U.S. dollar denominated borrowing of identical average life that does not exceed 10% over the Applicable
Rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that fees in the form of placement or commitment fees, or other similar fees, would be paid to lenders,
placement agents or other third parties in connection with the issuance of any such non-recourse debt securities.
CSW requests authority for any Project Parent to agree to pay placement or commitment fees, and other similar fees,
in connection with any borrowing, provided that the effective annual interest charge on any indebtedness evidencing
such borrowing is not greater than 115% of the stated interest rate thereon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with the issuance of debt securities by any Project Parent, it is anticipated that such Project Parent
may pledge and/or grant a security interest in its assets. Such pledge or security interest may include, without limitation,
the shares or other equity securities of any FUCO, EWG or Project Parent that it owns, including, without limitation,
a security interest in any distributions from any such FUCO, EWG or Project Parent, or a collateral assignment of its
rights under and interests in its other property, including, without limitation, any rights under any power purchase
agreement, fuel supply agreement or other project agreement to which it is a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the aggregate outstanding principal amount of non-recourse debt securities issued by Project
Parents to third parties will not exceed $600 million at any one time. Such amount is separate and apart from, and in
excess of, the Aggregate General Authority. No more than $200 million principal amount of such non-recourse debt
securities at any time outstanding may be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In any case in which CSW
directly or indirectly owns less than all of the equity interests of a Project Parent, only that portion of the non-recourse
indebtedness of such Project Parent equal to CSW's equity ownership percentage shall be included for purposes of
the foregoing limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSW, Energy, CSWI, CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios and their affiliates further request that no additional authority be required
from the Commission after December 31, 1997 in order to maintain existing Guarantees and/or Investments made prior
to such date in accordance with the Act and all applicable rules, regulations and orders of the Commission. If CSW,
Energy, CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios determine to make any additional investments after December 31, 1997, appropriate
authority of the Commission will be sought.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Travelers is a financial services holding company engaged, through its subsidiaries and certain affiliates,
principally in four business segments; investment services, consumer finance services, life insurance services,
and property and casualty services. The Travelers and its subsidiaries are referred to as The Travelers Group. One
of The Travelers' principal indirect subsidiaries, Smith Barney Inc., which is a subsidiary of Smith Barney Holdings,
Inc., is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``1934 Act'') and an investment
adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Travelers proposes to establish the Partnerships to provide investment opportunities for highly compensated
key employees of The Travelers Group (``Eligible Employees''). The Partnerships will allow the Eligible Employees
to diversify their investments, to pool their investment resources and to receive the benefit of certain investment
opportunities that come to the attention of The Travelers Group. Each Partnership will be an ``employees' securities
company'' as that term is defined in section 2(a)(13) of the Act, and will operate as a closed-end, non-diversified,
management investment company. Each Partnership will have a general partner, the executive officers and directors
of which will be Eligible Employees. The affairs of each Partnership will be governed by a limited partnership agreement
to be executed by the general partner and each limited partner who will invest in the Partnership. The Travelers Group
will bear all expenses incurred in connection with the organization of the Partnerships. Units will be sold without
a sales load.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Eligible Employees, in addition to being employees, officers or directors of The Travelers Group, will be engaged
in various aspects of the financial services business. They also will be sophisticated investors who are highly compensated
and otherwise able to fend for themselves without benefit of regulatory safeguards, and will be required to meet the
standards for ``accredited investors'' in rule 501(a)(6) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Units in the Partnerships will not be transferable by a limited partner except with the express consent of the general
partner and then only to parties that fall within the class of persons referred to in section 2(a)(13) of the Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. The Partnerships may provide that the general partner will have the right, but not the obligation, to acquire the
units of the limited partners upon the termination of a limited partner's employment with The Travelers Group for
any reason or upon his or her bankruptcy. In addition, the Partnerships may provide that in the event of a limited partner's
death, total physical disability or adjudication of incompetence, the limited partner or his or her representative
may request that the general partner, or its assignee or designee, terminate his or her participation and purchase
the limited partner's interest in the Partnership. The general partner, or its assignee or designee, shall have no
obligation to grant such requests. If granted, however, the general partner, or its assignee or designee, shall pay
the limited partner an amount equal to what the general partner determines in good faith to be the fair market value
of the limited partner's interest as of the semi-annual valuation date preceding the limited partner's termination
date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Pending investment, Partnership funds may be invested by the general partner in short-term investments. In compliance
with section 12(d)(1)(A)(1) of the Act, no Partnership will purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by
another investment company if the Partnership immediately after such purchase or acquisition will own in the aggregate
more than 3 percent of the total outstanding voting stock of any such investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Management of each Partnership will be exclusively vested in its general partner, which will be, directly or indirectly,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Travelers. The general partner will make all investment decisions for the Partnerships
and will have all powers and rights necessary to carry out the objectives of each of the Partnerships, except that the
general partner may delegate certain of its responsibilities to a manager. No compensation will be paid to the general
partner for its services except that it may receive reimbursement of its out-of-pocket expenses. No separate management
fee will be charged by the general partner. No compensation will be paid by a Partnership to the directors or officers
of the entity controlling the general partner for their services to the general partner other than reimbursement
for reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred during the course of conducting the business of the
Partnership. However, expenses charged by the general partner to any Partnerships may include expenses charged
by an entity affiliated with The Travelers Group for services rendered to the Partnership, but without any additional
markup charged to the Partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A general partner and/or manager will register as an investment adviser if required under applicable law. The determination
as to whether a general partner or manager is required to register under the Advisers Act shall be made by The Travelers
Group; no relief in respect to such determination is requested in the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Each general partner will undertake to contribute capital to the Partnership in an amount equal to at least 1 percent
of the aggregate amount of capital contributed by the limited partners. A general partner or another member of The
Travelers Group (the ``Electing Partner'') may undertake to contribute capital to a Partnership in an amount up to
ten times the aggregate amount of capital contributed by the limited partners. The limited partnership agreement
of a Partnership may provide that the Electing Partner shall not receive its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
allocation of profits and losses with respect to a specified portion of its capital contribution to the Partnership.
With respect to the portion of the general partner's capital contribution for which it will not receive its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
allocation (the ``Non-Allocable Portion''), the Electing Partner will be entitled to a cumulative return, which
will not be greater than its ``opportunity cost of funds'' with respect to such Non-Allocable Portion (the ``Return'').
The Non-Allocable Portion will be a specified percentage of the amount of cash contributed by the Electing Partner
as determined by The Travelers Group and set forth in the limited partnership agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The ``opportunity cost of funds'' will be, at the election of the general partner made at the time the Partnership
is organized, either; the applicable interest rate, or a fixed rate of return reflecting the yield in Treasury securities
with a term of similar length as the expected average life of the Partnership. The ``applicable interest rate'' will
be, at the election of a general partner made at the time that a Partnership is organized; the prime commercial lending
rate as in effect from time to time, the ``applicable federal rate'' under section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue
code of 1984 (or its successors) as determined in the good faith judgment of the general partner, or The Travelers Group's
``effective cost of borrowing'' defined as average effective consolidated borrowing costs for commercial paper,
bank loan and other short term borrowings, computed on a monthly basis.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. The Return will be allocable annually out of Partnership profits and will be payable to the general partner when
profits are realized by the Partnership or, to the extent not previously paid, upon the liquidation of the Partnership.
The rate of the Return may be more favorable to the Partnership than prevailing market rates for comparable types of
``borrowing'' because a Partnership would receive the benefits of the prime rate or the rate at which the Treasury
borrows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The Partnerships' net profits and losses will be allocated to the general partner and the limited partners in the
same proportion as the amount of their respective paid-in capital that was employed to make the investments giving
rise to such profits or losses, except as previously described with respect to the Non-Allocable Portion, if any,
and except that, unless otherwise specifically provided in the limited partnership agreement, the capital accounts
of the limited partners will not be reduced below zero and any additional losses will be allocated to the general partner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Each Partnership will send its limited partners annual reports regarding its operations and current valuation
of Partnership assets. As soon as practicable after the end of each tax year of a Partnership, a report will be transmitted
to each limited partner setting out information with respect to the limited partner's share of income, gains, losses,
credits and other items for federal income tax purposes, resulting from the operation of the Partnership during that
year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The general partner of a Partnership may purchase units which it may offer to new Eligible Employees joining The
Travelers Group after closing of the Partnership. The sale of these units by the general partner will have no dilutive
effect on the interest of already existing limited partners because the units will have already been issued and sold
at the closing of the Partnership.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. On behalf of the Partnerships, The Travelers requests an exemption under section 6(b) and 6(e) of the Act from all
provisions of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except section 9, certain provisions of section 17,
and sections 36 through 53 of the Act, and the rules and regulations under those sections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Travelers requests an exemption from section 17(a) to permit a Partnership: (a) to purchase from Smith Barney,
or another affiliate of The Travelers, securities or interests in properties previously acquired for the account
of Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers; (b) to purchase interests or property in a company or other investment
vehicle in which Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers already owns securities; (c) to sell to Smith Barney
or other affiliates of The Travelers securities or interests in properties previously acquired by the Partnerships;
(d) to invest in investment companies, investment partnerships or other investment vehicles offered, sponsored
or managed by Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers (referred to as ``Travelers Sponsored Vehicles''),
or to purchase securities from Travelers Sponsored Vehicles, except that The Travelers will not invest more than
15% of the assets of any Partnership in Travelers Sponsored Vehicles; (e) to invest in securities of, or to lend money
to, entities with which Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers have performed investment banking or other
services and from which they may have received fees; (f) to purchase interests in or lend money to a company or other
investment vehicle (i) in which Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers or their respective employees
own 5% or more of the voting securities or (ii) that is otherwise affiliated with the Partnership or The Travelers;
(g) to purchase securities that are underwritten by Smith Barney or by another affiliate of The Travelers (including
a member of a selling group) on terms at least as favorable to the Partnership as those offered to investors other than
``affiliated persons'' (as defined in the Act) of Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers; and (h) to participate
as a selling security-holder in a public offering (i) that is underwritten by Smith Barney or by another affiliate
of The Travelers or (ii) in which Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers acts as a member of the selling group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Travelers also requests an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder, subject to the conditions
specified below, to permit a Partnership to make an investment in an entity in which a Partnership, Smith Barney or
another affiliate of The Travelers, or any ``affiliated persons'' (as defined in the Act) of the Partnership or an
``affiliated person'' of such person also invests or participates or plans concurrently or otherwise directly or
indirectly to invest or become a participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Travelers requests an exemption from the requirements, contained in rules 17f&hyph;1(a) and 17f&hyph;1(c),
that the custodial agreement between The Travelers Group and a Partnership must be in writing and transmitted to the
SEC. Requiring a written contract and transmission to the SEC would unnecessarily burden The Travelers and cause
unnecessary expense to The Travelers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Travelers requests an exemption from the requirements, contained in rule 17g&hyph;1(d), (e), and (g), that
a majority of the board of directors of the entity controlling the general partner who are not interested persons take
certain actions and make certain approvals concerning bonding and request instead that the actions and approvals
required by the rule to be taken by the board of directors may and will be taken by officers and directors, regardless
of whether they are ``interested.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. The Travelers requests an exemption from rule 17j&hyph;1, except rule 17j&hyph;1(a). Rule 17j&hyph;1 requires
that every access person of a registered investment company report to the investment company with respect to transactions
in any security in which the access person has any beneficial ownership in the security. Applicant believes that the
community of interests among the partners of the Partnerships and the conditions described below provide adequate
safeguards. The Travelers does not seek an exemption from, and the Partnerships will comply with, the anti-fraud
provisions of paragraph (a) of rule 17j&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Travelers believes that the exemptions requested under section 6(b) of the Act are consistent with the protection
of investors. The exemptions are being requested because they are considered necessary or relevant to the operations
of the Partnerships as an investment program uniquely adapted to the needs of employees of The Travelers Group. The
Travelers further believes that the requested relief is consistent with the legislative history relating to employees'
securities companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Travelers also believes that a substantial community of economic and other interests exists among The Travelers
Group and the limited partners which obviates the need for protection of investors under the Act. The Partnerships
will be conceived, organized and managed by persons who will be investing in the Partnerships, and will not be promoted
by persons seeking to profit from fees or investment advice or from the distribution of securities. The travelers
also believes that the terms of the proposed affiliated transactions will be reasonable and fair and free from overreaching,
and will be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant will comply with the following conditions if the requested order is granted:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each proposed transaction involving a Partnership otherwise prohibited by section 17(A) or section 17(D) of the
Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder (the ``section 17 transactions'') will be effected only if the general partner
determines that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable to the
partners and do not involve overreaching of the Partnership or its partners on the part of any person concerned; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. the transaction is consistent with the interests of the partners, the Partnership's organizational documents
and the Partnership's reports to its partners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the general partners will record and preserve a description of such affiliated transactions, their
findings, the information or materials upon which their findings are based and the basis therefor. All such records
will be maintained for the life of the Partnerships and at least two years thereafter, and will be subject to examination
by the Commission and its staff.

2. In connection with the section 17 transactions, the general partner will adopt, and periodically review and update,
procedures designed to ensure that reasonable inquiry is made, prior to the consummation of any such transaction,
with respect to the possible involvement in the transaction of any affiliated person or promoter of or principal underwriter
for the Partnerships, or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal underwriter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The general partner will not invest the funds of any Partnership in any investment in which an Affiliated Co-Investor
has or proposes to acquire the same class of securities of the same issuer, where the investment involves a joint enterprise
or other joint arrangement within the meaning of rule 17d&hyph;1 in which the Partnership and an Affiliated Co-Investor
are participants, unless any such Affiliated Co-Investor, prior to disposing of all or part of its investment, (a)
gives the general partner sufficient, but not less than one day's, notice of its intent to dispose of its investment,
and (b) refrains from disposing of its investment unless the Partnership has the opportunity to dispose of the Partnership's
investment prior to or concurrently with, on the same terms as, and

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with the Affiliated Co-Investor. The term ``Affiliated Co-Investor'' means any person who is: (1) an ``affiliated
person'' (as such term is defined in the Act) of the Partnership; (2) a member of The Travelers Group; (3) an officer
or director of a member of the Travelers Group; (4) a travelers sponsored vehicle; or (5) a company in which an officer
or director of the general partner acts as an officer, director, or general partner, or has a similar capacity to control
the sale or other disposition of the company's securities. The restrictions contained in this condition, however,
shall not be deemed to limit or prevent the disposition of an investment by an Affiliated Co-Investor: (a) to its direct
or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, to any company (a ``parent'') of which the Affiliated Co-Investor is a direct
or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, or to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of its parent; (b) to immediate
family members of the Affiliated Co-Investor or a trust established for any Affiliated Co-Investor or any such family
member; or (c) when the investment is comprised of securities that are (i) listed on a national securities exchange
registered under section 6 of the 1934 Act, (ii) national market system securities pursuant to section 11A(1)(2)
of the 1934 Act and rule 11A(a)(2)&hyph;1 thereunder, or (iii) government securities as defined in section 2(a)(16)
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each Partnership and its general partner will maintain and preserve, for the life of each such Partnership and at
least two years thereafter, such accounts, books, and other documents as constitute the record forming the basis
for the audited financial statements that are to be provided to the partners, and each annual report of such Partnership
required by the terms of the applicable partnership agreement to be sent to the partners, and agree that all such records
will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.

5. The general partner will send to each limited partner who had an interest in the Partnership, at any time during the
fiscal year then ended, Partnership financial statements audited by the Partnership's independent accountants.
At the end of each fiscal year, the general partner will make a valuation or have a valuation made of all of the assets
of the Partnership as of such fiscal year end. In addition, within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year of each of
the Partnerships or as soon as practicable thereafter, the general partner shall send a report to each person who was

for the preparation by the limited partner of his or her federal and state income tax returns and a report of the investment
activities of the Partnership during such year.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Academic Programs of the United States Information Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs
announces an open competition for an assistance award program. Accredited post-secondary U.S. educational institutions
and U.S. scholarly/professional organizations are invited to submit proposals to conduct exchange programs with
post-secondary educational institutions in Croatia and Macedonia. The purpose of the exchange programs is to develop
curricula and teaching methodologies for foreign faculties in the field of business management. USIA anticipates
awarding one grant not to exceed $300,000 for a project in Macedonia, and one grant not to exceed $200,000 for a project
in Croatia. Public or private non-profit organizations applying under this program must meet the provisions described
in IRS regulation 501(c)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant activities should begin no later than February 1, 1995. Programs must be a minimum of 18 months and a maximum of
two years in duration. Activities must include placement of U.S. faculty at Croatian or Macedonian institutions
for in-country training of foreign faculty and for development of sustainable programs to educate future foreign
business management teachers and business people. Targeted program activities may include: Faculty development
and enrichment; curriculum design; modernization of the administrative structures within the foreign institution;
outreach to the private sector; and direct teaching. U.S. and foreign participants may include post-graduate students
on a ``faculty track'' who are currently involved in teaching at participating institutions (not to exceed 25% of
all participants). Development of linkages with the private sector and development of appropriate materials are
encouraged. Orientation, seminar, workshop and semester-long course formats will be acceptable. Visits to partner
institutions by staff or consultants to plan joint projects may be funded under this program but should be a relatively
small part of the overall exchange. Applicants are strongly encouraged to maintain an in-country presence at the
foreign partner institution(s) for the duration of the program. This presence should include project director(s)
at the partner institution(s) for periods of at least one continuous academic semester.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Courses developed may include, but are not limited to: Marketing, production management, economics, industrial
relations, finance, accounting, international business and business communications. Proposals must provide
for a two-way exchange. Exchange activities should include establishment of electronic communications between

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. Programs must
also maintain their scholarly integrity and meet the highest standard of academic excellence or artistic achievement.
``Diversity'' should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to
race, gender, religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are
strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle.

Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific purpose of this program is to assist Central and East European countries in their transformation to free
market economies through the development of business management training capabilities in academic institutions.
An important goal of the program is to create enduring linkages between designated foreign and U.S. institutions.
Proposals that are extensions or enhancements of past or current relationships with a partner institution will be
accepted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Institutional Commitment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In making award decisions, USIA will focus especially on evidence of an ongoing commitment by the U.S. partner to internationalizing
its educational programs as well as a commitment by both partner institutions to the success of the particular exchange
program. Each proposal must include documentation of institutional support for the proposed program in the form
of signed letters of endorsement from the president, chancellor, or director of the U.S. and foreign institution(s)
involved. The documentation may also be submitted in the form of a signed agreement by the same persons. Each agreement
or letter of endorsement must describe the institution's commitment to an on-going partnership and make specific
reference to the proposed program and how it will fit into and be supported by the institution's current activities
in internationalizing its educational programs. Proposals must discuss on how the partnership will be continued
beyond the period of the grant award. If not submitted with original proposal, documentation of support from foreign
institutions must be received by 5 p.m. Washington, D.C. time on October 24, 1994, addressed to Robin Kline or Mary
Ann Garlic, E/ASU, Room 349, U.S. Information Agency, 301 4th Street SW., Washington, DC 20547. Applicant institutions
are required to make their own arrangements with the appropriate foreign institutions regarding institutional
commitment and visas, and the proposal must make reference to this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Budget:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 USIA anticipates awarding one grant not to exceed $300,000 for a project in Macedonia, and one grant not to exceed $200,000
for a project in Croatia. Institutions must submit a comprehensive line item budget, including a budget summary page,
based on the specific guidance in the Application Package. USIA will not pay for indirect costs under this program;
however, indirect costs may be included as part of an institution's cost sharing. Requesting USIA support for indirect
costs will result in technical ineligibility. Proposals must demonstrate substantial cost-sharing (dollar and
in-kind) in both program and administrative categories, including overseas partner contributions. Cost-sharing
may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The recipient must maintain written records to support all
allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation, as well as cost to be paid by the
Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions
must be in accordance with OMB Circular A110, Attachment E. Cost-sharing and matching should be described in the proposal.
In the event the recipient does not provide the minimum amount of cost sharing as stipulated in the recipient's budget,
the USIA contribution will be reduced in proportion to the recipient's contribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position
(SOP) No. 92&hyph;9; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect
cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The audit costs shall be identified separately for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting services; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular A&hyph;133, AICPA SOP 92&hyph;9,
and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA reserves the right to reduce, increase or otherwise modify proposal budgets in accordance with the needs of the
program. For organizations with less than four years of experience in international exchange activities, grants
will be limited to a maximum of $60,000. Administrative costs cannot exceed 20 percent of the requested budget, including
administrative expenses for orientation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowable costs for the program include the following (see Application Package for further details):

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice amends the FY 94 NOFA for Indian Applicants under the HOME Program (59 FR 11424; March 10, 1994) at section
I.(e)(4)(iii)(C), which deals with the selection criteria pertaining to environmental review. The amendment is
made to reflect changes resulting from The Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (MHPDR ACT)
(Pub. L. 102&hyph;233, approved April 11, 1994). The changes involve removing the requirement that after rating
and ranking but before selection for award, HUD Field ONAPs will perform an environmental review of applications
in accordance with 24 CFR part 50, and that applications may be reranked or disqualified on the basis of the environmental
review. These provisions are replaced with the provision that after rating and ranking, applicants with the highest
scores will be selected and offered awards. The grantee must assume responsibility for completing the environmental
review of the project under 24 CFR part 58. In accordance with 24 CFR part 58, until the grantee completes its environmental
review and obtains a release of funds from HUD, the grantee may not commit HOME funds to activities (unless the activities
are exempt from review under 24 CFR part 58), or expend any other funds for activities unless they are exempt or would
not have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. However, a grantee may expend
HOME or other funds on environmental reviews, exempt under 24 CFR part 58, before obtaining a release of funds to be
used for non-exempt purposes from HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice adds a new paragraph I.(e)(4)(iii)(E) which clarifies that unsuccessful applicants may notify the ONAP,
within 90 days of being informed of their score, of computational errors in the rating and ranking. This paragraph
provides for the correction of such errors in rating and ranking and, if the error denied funding of the applicant,
provides for funding the application in subsequent funding cycles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also amends Appendix 1 of the FY 1994 Indian Home Program NOFA by including a new address for the Denver Office
of Native American Programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the following modifications are made in FR Doc. 94&hyph;5535 to the NOFA titled, ``NOFA For Fiscal Year
1994 For Indian Applicants Under The HOME Program'', published on March 10, 1994 (59 FR 11424): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On page 11429, paragraph I.(e)(4)(iii)(C), which appears in the first column, is revised to read as follows:

(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ranking process will produce an ordered list of projects that may receive funding. The order is established by
the number of points the project received in the rating process. The eligibility requirement for further consideration
will be 50 out of 100 points. Project applications scoring lower than 50 points will be set aside as non-responsive
and ineligible. After rating and ranking, applicants with the highest scores will be selected and offered awards.
The grantee must assume responsibility for completing the environmental review of the project under 24 CFR part 58.
In accordance with 24 CFR part 58, until the grantee completes its environmental review and obtains a release of funds
from HUD, the grantee may not commit HOME funds to activities (unless the activities are exempt from review under 24
CFR part 58), or expend any other funds for activities unless they are exempt or would not have an adverse environmental
impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. Environmental studies are exempt under 24 CFR part 58 and therefore
a grantee may expend HOME or other funds on environmental reviews before obtaining a release of funds to be used for
non-exempt purposes from HUD. For the purposes of geographic diversity, HUD may award at least one grant to each of
the areas covered by the Offices of Indian Programs listed in Appendix 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Errors in rating and ranking.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applicants may bring computational errors in the rating and ranking of applications to the attention of ONAP within
90 days of being informed of their score. If an ONAP review determines that there was a computational error that denied
funding to the applicant, the applicant will be funded out of remaining funds in the challenged round of funding, or
out of the next available round of funding.
