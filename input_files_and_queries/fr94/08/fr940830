SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are amending the pink bollworm regulations by adding certain portions of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties in Tennessee
to the list of suppressive areas for pink bollworm and by adding Tennessee to the list of States quarantined because
of pink bollworm. This action will impose restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from those
regulated areas in Dyer and Lauderdale Counties, TN. This action is necessary to prevent the interstate movement
of pink bollworm into noninfested areas.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The pink bollworm, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pectinophora gossypiella
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Saunders), is one of the world's most destructive pests of cotton. This insect spread to the United States from Mexico
in 1917, and now exists throughout most of the cotton-producing States west of the Mississippi River. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pink bollworm regulations, contained in 7 CFR 301.52 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
301.52&hyph;10 (referred to below as the regulations), quarantine certain States and restrict the interstate movement
of regulated articles from regulated areas in quarantined States for the purpose of preventing the spread of pink
bollworm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulated areas for the pink bollworm are designated as either suppressive areas or generally infested areas. Restrictions
are imposed on the interstate movement of regulated articles from both types of areas in order to prevent the movement
of pink bollworm into noninfested areas. However, eradication of pink bollworm infestations is undertaken as an
objective only in places that are designated as suppressive areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the effective date of this document, Tennessee contained no areas regulated because of pink bollworm. However,
surveys conducted by inspectors of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and by State agencies in Tennessee
have established that pink bollworm has spread into areas of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties, TN. Therefore, in order
to prevent the further spread of pink bollworm, we are amending the list of regulated areas in &sect;301.52&hyph;2a
of the regulations by designating portions of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties, TN, as pink bollworm suppressive areas.
Descriptions of those areas designated as suppressive areas are set forth in the rule portion of this document. We
are also adding Tennessee to the list in &sect;301.52(a) of States that are quarantined because of pink bollworm.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 301.52&hyph;2 of the regulations states that less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as
a regulated area only if the State is enforcing a quarantine or regulations that impose restrictions on the intrastate
movement of regulated articles that are substantially the same as those imposed with respect to the interstate movement
of such articles under the Federal regulations. Tennessee has elected to regulate the intrastate movement of regulated
articles from the designated areas of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties under the State's Plant Pest Act of 1955.

Emergency Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an emergency exists that
warrants publication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary
to prevent the artificial spread of pink bollworm to noninfested areas of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

comments.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget
has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule restricts the interstate movement of regulated articles from the regulated areas of Dyer and Lauderdale
Counties in Tennessee. Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that there are nine cotton
farms and four gin and seed disposal companies that will be affected by the new restrictions. All of these farms and
gin and seed disposal companies are considered to be small entities under Small Business Administration criteria.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 834,000 bales of cotton and 332,000 metric tons of cottonseed were produced in Tennessee in 1992; of
that total, 3,963 bales of cotton and 1,530 metric tons of cottonseed were produced in those areas of Dyer and Lauderdale
Counties affected by this interim rule. Thus, production in the affected areas of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties represents
only about 0.5 percent of the cotton and 0.5 percent of the cottonseed produced in Tennessee in 1992.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The costs of treating unprocessed cotton and cottonseed to qualify them for interstate movement is approximately
$1.90 per bale of cotton and $0.13 per bushel of cottonseed. For the 3 most recent marketing years (1990&hyph;1992),
the average price per bale of cotton received by farmers was about $284; the average price per bushel of cottonseed
received by farmers was about $1.60 (USDA, ``Agricultural Statistics 1993,'' U.S. Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC, 1993). Thus, the costs of treatment, seen as a percentage of value, range between 0.5 and 0.8 percent
of the value of cotton and between 6 and 9 percent of the value of cottonseed. The majority of the cotton and cottonseed
produced in the affected areas of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties is sold for processing, so the amount of cotton and cottonseed
produced in the affected areas that will require treatment for interstate movement is expected to be small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Plant Quarantine Act (7 U.S.C. 151 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) and the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150aa 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) authorize the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to prohibit or restrict the importation into the
United States of any plants, roots, bulbs, seeds, or other plant products in order to prevent the introduction of plant
pests into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations promulgated under this authority, among others, include 7 CFR 319.37 through 319.37&hyph;14, ``Subpart_Nursery
Stock, Plants, Roots, Bulbs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seeds, and Other Plant Products'' (the regulations). These regulations govern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the importation of living plants, plant parts, and seeds for or capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propagation, and related articles. Other sections of 7 CFR 319 deal with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
articles such as cut flowers, or fruits and vegetables intended for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations restrict or prohibit the importation of most nursery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock, plants, roots, bulbs, seeds, and other plant products. These articles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are classified as either ``prohibited articles'' or ``restricted articles.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A prohibited article is an article that the Deputy Administrator for Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), APHIS,
has determined cannot feasibly be inspected, treated, or handled to prevent it from introducing plant pests new to
or not widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States. Prohibited articles may not be imported
into the United States, unless imported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for experimental or
scientific purposes under specified safeguards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A restricted article is an article that the Deputy Administrator for PPQ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has determined can be inspected, treated, or handled to essentially eliminate the risk of its spreading plant pests
if imported into the United States. Restricted articles may be imported into the United States if they are imported
in compliance with restrictions that may include permit and phytosanitary certificate requirements, inspection,
treatment, or postentry quarantine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the effective date of this rule, under &sect;319.37&hyph;2 of the regulations, we prohibited the importation
into the United States of strawberry plants (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fragaria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.) from Australia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, The Netherlands,
New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, and the countries formed from the former Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics. Also, under the regulations, we allowed strawberry plants from countries other than
those listed above to be imported into the United States as restricted articles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule prohibits the importation into the United States of strawberry plants from any country other than Canada
or Israel. This action is intended to prevent the introduction into the United States of exotic strains of a fungal
pathogen, red stele disease, now widespread internationally. Red stele disease attacks strawberry plant roots,
reducing fruit production and in some cases killing the plant. While some strains of red stele disease already occur
in the United States, APHIS needs to prevent the introduction into the United States of exotic, and possibly more virulent,
strains of the disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, we are requiring that phytosanitary certificates of inspection accompanying 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fragaria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp. from Israel contain an additional declaration that the strawberries were found by the plant protection service
of Israel to be free of red stele disease pathogen as well as any other damaging strawberry pathogens, based on visual
inspection and indexing of the parent stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also prohibits the importation into the United States of currant plants (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ribes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.) from New Zealand. Before the effective date of this rule, the importation of currant plants was prohibited from
Europe under &sect;319.37&hyph;2, but currant plants could be imported from other countries as restricted articles.
This action is intended to prevent the introduction into the United States of an exotic currant disease, black currant
reversion agent, which has recently spread to New Zealand. Black currant reversion agent, a viral pathogen spread
by an insect vector, can significantly reduce fruit production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this rule prohibits the importation of an additional species of the sentry palm (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.), except as a restricted article from Lord Howe Island, New South Wales, Australia. Currently, the import of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea belmoreana
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from all countries is prohibited. However, import of the other species of the genus, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea forsterana
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, is not prohibited. Because pathogens attack most species within a genus, we believe extending the import prohibition
to both species of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are allowing importation of both species of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from Lord Howe Island as restricted articles, however, because our review of the scientific literature did not reveal
any indication of the presence of the lethal yellowing pathogen, the cadang-cadang pathogen, or any other damaging
palm pests on Lord Howe Island. Additionally, New South Wales prohibits the importation of all palms and palm products
onto the Lord Howe Island from all sources. We are requiring that phytosanitary certificates of inspection accompanying

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp. from Lord Howe Island contain both a declaration of origin (must be Lord Howe Island) and a declaration that the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 were found by the plant protection service of New South Wales to be free of the lethal yellowing pathogen and the cadang-cadang
pathogen, as well as any other damaging palm pathogens, based on visual inspection.

Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are also changing in &sect;319.37&hyph;2 the spelling of the genus name of the sentry palm from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howeia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the more common spelling.

Immediate Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to prevent the introduction
into the United States of exotic diseases affecting strawberries, currants, and sentry palms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments.

This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule prohibits the import of strawberry plants from all foreign countries except Canada and Israel and
prohibits the import of currant plants from New Zealand. Also, it prohibits the import into the United States of an
additional species of the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (sentry palm), except from Lord Howe Island, New South Wales.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, strawberry plants are imported into the United States only from Canada and Israel and only by one importer.
Furthermore, this importer is not a small entity by Small Business Administration standards (having 100 or fewer
employees). Therefore, prohibiting the import of strawberry plants from all foreign countries except Canada and
Israel would not have a significant economic impact on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No currant plants are now imported into the United States from New Zealand. Prohibiting their import from New Zealand
thus will not have a significant economic impact on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we were not able to obtain any information on the domestic production or import of either species of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; we believe this is because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is neither produced domestically nor imported on a large scale. We anticipate, therefore, that prohibiting the import
into the United States of both species of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from everywhere except Lord Howe Island, New South Wales, Australia, will not have a significant economic impact
on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule clarifies that peanut handlers not signatory to Peanut Marketing Agreement No. 146 (Agreement)
may store and shell certain Segregation 2 seed peanut lots with Segregation 1 seed peanut lots when such lots are produced
under the auspices of a State agency which regulates or controls their production. This interim rule also updates
information on the laboratories qualified to perform aflatoxin testing of shelled peanuts. Allowing peanut handlers
to commingle certain seed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peanut lots reduces the space and costs needed to store seed peanuts. Updating laboratory information should assist
handlers in moving peanuts to market. These changes are intended to bring the non-signatory handling requirements
into conformity with those specified in the Agreement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule is issued pursuant to requirements of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This interim final rule will not preempt
any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is
to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be
unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 45 handlers of peanuts who have not signed the Agreement who are subject to the regulations
contained herein. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601]
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. It is estimated that most of the handlers are small entities.
Most producers doing business with these handlers are also small entities. Small agricultural producers have been
defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the reported U.S. production, mostly covered under the Agreement, was approximately 3.33 billion pounds
of peanuts, a 22 percent decrease from 1992 and the lowest level since 1983. The preliminary 1993 peanut crop value
is $991.65 million, 77 percent of the 1992 crop value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After aflatoxin was found in peanuts in the mid-1960's, the domestic peanut industry has sought to minimize aflatoxin
contamination in peanuts and peanut products. Under authority of the Act, Peanut Marketing Agreement No. 146 and
the Peanut Administrative Committee (Committee) were established by the Secretary in 1965. The Agreement was signed
by a majority of domestic peanut handlers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 101&hyph;220, enacted December 12, 1989, amended section 608(b) of the Act to require that all peanuts
handled by persons who have not entered into the Agreement (non-signers) be subject to quality and inspection requirements
to the same extent and manner as are required under the Agreement. It is estimated that 5 percent of the domestic peanut
crop is marketed by non-signatory handlers and the remainder of the crop is handled by signatory handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the non-signer provisions, no peanuts may be sold or otherwise disposed of for human consumption if the peanuts
fail to meet the quality requirements of the Agreement. Regulations to implement Pub. L. 101&hyph;220 were issued
and made effective on December 4, 1990 [55 FR 49980] and amended several times thereafter, and are published in 7 CFR
Part 997. All such amendments were made to ensure that the non-signer handling requirements remain consistent with
modifications to the handling requirements applied to signatory handlers under the Agreement. Violation of those
regulations may result in a penalty in the form of an assessment by the Secretary equal to 140 percent of the support
price for quota peanuts. The support price for quota peanuts is determined under section 108B of the Agricultural
Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1445c&hyph;3) for the crop year during which the violation occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of P.L. 101&hyph;220 and the objective of the Agreement is to insure that only wholesome peanuts of good
quality enter edible market channels. Under the non-signer and Agreement regulatory provisions, farmers' stock
peanuts with visible 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aspergillus flavus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mold (the principal source of aflatoxin) are required to be diverted to non-edible uses. Each lot of shelled peanuts
and certain lots of inshell peanuts, destined for edible channels, must be officially sampled and chemically tested
for aflatoxin by the Department or in other laboratories listed in the regulations. Inspection and chemical analysis
programs are administered by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the non-signer provisions, the second sentence of paragraph (e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Seed peanuts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 prohibits the commingling of Segregation 2 seed lots with Segregation 1 peanut lots intended for human consumption.
The difference between Segregation 1 and Segregation 2 lots is that Segregation 1 lots may contain no more than 2 percent
damaged kernels and no more than 1 percent concealed damaged kernels, while Segregation 2 lots may contain more than
2 percent damaged kernels and 1 percent concealed damaged kernels. Both Segregation 1 lots and Segregation 2 lots
must be free of visible 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aspergillus flavus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule clarifies the handling provisions in paragraph (e) of &sect;997.20 Incoming regulation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to allow Segregation 2 seed peanut lots containing up to 3 percent total damaged kernels to be stored, shelled and commingled
with Segregation 1 seed peanut lots if both lots were produced under the auspices of a State peanut agency which regulates
or controls the production of the lots being commingled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee meets in February or March each year and recommends to the Secretary such rules and regulations as may
be necessary to keep the Agreement consistent with current industry practice. The Committee met on March 16, 1994,
and unanimously recommended clarification of seed peanut handling regulations under the Agreement. Members of
the Committee noted the impracticality of having separate storage bins for each of the various types and varieties
of seed peanuts with up to 3 percent damage. It was noted that, if Segregation 2 seed lots with up to 3 percent damaged
must be stored separate from Segregation 1 seed lots, ``foundation,'' ``registered,'' and ``certified'' seed lots
would have to be segregated into separate categories. This could increase the number of separate bins and space needed
to store seed peanut lots. The current regulations for both signers and non-signers do not specifically address commingling
Segregation 1 seed lots with Segregation 2 seed lots. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee concluded that it is impracticable to require such Segregation 2 seed peanuts be stored and shelled
separate from Segregation 1 seed peanuts. The Department has initiated rulemaking to implement such a clarification
in handling requirements applied on signatory handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule revises &sect;997.20(e) for non-signer seed peanuts and is intended to bring the non-signatory
handling requirements into conformity with those specified in the Agreement. This rule clarifies handling requirements
and will facilitate the movement of peanuts to market.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule will have no affect on the outgoing quality regulation of the non-signer provisions. The quality and handling
requirements, as specified in &sect;997.30 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Outgoing regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 applicable to non-signatory 1993&hyph;94 crop peanuts, continues to be effective for 1994&hyph;95 crop peanuts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule also updates addresses and facsimile numbers, where applicable, of approved aflatoxin testing
laboratories that perform chemical analyses required by the non-signatory handling regulations. This information
is provided in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of &sect;997.30 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Outgoing regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Non-signatory handlers may send peanut samples to any laboratory on the list, per instructions specified in paragraph
(c) of the outgoing regulation. This rule also updates information in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) identifying the contact
point of the USDA Science Division headquarter's office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all available information, it is found that this action will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impractical, unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) This action merely clarifies restrictions on peanut handlers not subject to the Agreement; (2) the new
crop year begins on July 1, 1994, and handlers need to know the regulations applicable to handling the 1994 and subsequent
crop year peanuts as soon as possible; (3) this action brings the quality requirements under Part 997 into conformity
with those under the Agreement, as required by the Act; and (4) this action provides a 30-day comment period, and any
comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan [7 CFR 1210], hereinafter referred as the
Plan. The Plan is effective under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act, as amended by the Watermelon Research
and Promotion Improvement Act of 1993, [7 U.S.C. 4901&hyph;4916] hereinafter referred as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been determined to be not-significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under &sect;1650
of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision
of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification
of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition.
After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the
United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date
of the entry of the ruling.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,000 watermelon producers in the 50 States of the United States who would be affected by this rule. There are approximately
140 importers of watermelons. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5 million and small agricultural producers are defined
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of watermelon handlers, producers, and importers
may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. production of watermelons is estimated through the use of U.S. shipment statistics. Shipments of U.S.-produced
watermelons totaled about 1,895.6 million pounds in 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 percent less than in 1992. Imports of watermelons in 1993 totalled 343.5 million pounds, an increase of 12 percent.
Therefore, domestic production is about six times as great as the volume of imports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to the procedures for conduct of referenda reflect amendments to the Act. The overall economic impact
of these changes is not expected to be significant. The change from voting at Extension Service county offices to voting
by mail ballot will not cause a change in the burden on voters. Allowing importers to vote in the referendum would add
a burden for those importers who choose to vote. However, this burden is offset by the opportunity to vote on whether
they are covered by the program. Increasing the exemption level from 5 acres to 10 acres and the change in producers'
eligibility to vote will reduce the number of small producers eligible to vote in the program and hence the reduce burden
on small producers. Further, voting in the referendum is voluntary. Including the 50 States and the District of Columbia
will cause a burden on those producers and handlers in those regions but this burden is offset by the opportunity to
participate in the referendum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The research and promotion program is expected to continue to benefit producers, handlers, and importers subject
to the Plan by expanding and maintaining new and existing markets. Accordingly, the Administrator of AMS has determined
that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Paperwork Reduction Act

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[40 U.S.C. chapter 35], the information collection requirements contained in the Plan have previously been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0093. There will be a new reporting
burden on importers but the burden has been already approved by the OMB and assigned OMB control number 0581&hyph;0093.
This action adds no additional reporting burden. It has been estimated that it will take an average of 10 minutes for
each producer, handler, and importer of watermelons to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Plan, the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) administers a nationally coordinated program of
research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's position in the market
place and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for domestic watermelons. This program is financed by assessments
on producers and handlers of watermelons. The Plan specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and submitting
both the producer and handler assessments to the Board, reporting their handling of watermelons, and maintaining
records necessary to verify their reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 14, 1994 [59 FR 17739]. The rule published in April contained the proposed amendments to the Plan, rules and
regulations, rules of practice for petitions, and referendum procedures. The Department has decided to separately
make final the referendum procedures because the changes to the referendum procedures must be in place in order to
conduct the referendum in November 1994 on two of the amendments. Therefore, this action will put into effect the subpart
containing the referendum procedures. The proposed amendments to the Plan, rules and regulations, and rules of practice
for petitions are published separately in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deadline for comments on all of the proposed amendments published on April 14 was May 16, 1994. Twenty-one comments
were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three of the comments related to the referendum procedures. Three commentors stated that proof of voter eligibility
should be required. They stated that this could be accomplished by requesting voters to provide their business identification
number or social security number and/or sales receipts, acreage reports, or bill of lading that reflect their watermelon
activity for 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with requesting business identification number or social security number on the ballot as
proof of voter eligibility. However, it is not necessary to modify the referendum rules in order to collect this information.
This collection of information has been approved by OMB under OMB number 0581&hyph;0093 and does not add any burden
on voters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the Act authorize an assessment on watermelons imported into the United States by importers and
the addition of importer members to the Board if approved by watermelon producers, handlers, and importers in a referendum.
Therefore, watermelon importers will also be eligible to vote in the referenda. In order to include importers in the
referendum procedures, this rule will amend &sect;&sect;1210.200, 1210.201, 1210.202, 1210.203, and 1210.204
of the referendum procedures.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act increased the acreage for exempt producers from ``less than 5 acres'' to ``less than 10 acres'' of watermelons
and changed the eligibility for producers to serve on the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that a producer is eligible to serve on the Board as a representative of handlers (1) if a producer purchases
watermelons from other producers in a combined total volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the producer's own
production or (2) if the combined total volume of watermelons handled by the producer from the producer's own production
and purchases from other producer's production is more than 50 percent of the producer's own production. This provision
clarifies the eligibility of producers and handlers to serve on the Board as representatives of their specific group
and also applies to voter eligibility. In addition, the increase in the exemption level from ``less than 5 acres''
to ``less than 10 acres'' will determine producer's eligibility to vote because only producers of 10 acres or more
will be eligible to vote in the referendum. Therefore, this rule will amend &sect;&sect;1210.201 and 1210.202. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also increases applicability of the law from the 48 contiguous States to the 50 States and the District of Columbia.
Therefore, since they will be covered by the Plan, voters in Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia are entitled
to vote in the referendum. This rule will amend &sect;1210.201 accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also provides that all future promulgation and amendment referenda do not have to be conducted at Extension
Service county offices. This procedure proved to be expensive and difficult to administer. The Act will now allow
referenda to be conducted by mail ballot which will reduce the costs involved in conducting referenda and facilitate
a more timely tabulation of the results. In order to make this change, this rule will amend &sect;&sect;1210.203 and
1210.204. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minor changes are made in this final rule for the purpose of clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, conforming changes will be made to &sect;1210.201. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented with regard to the procedures to conduct a referendum, it
is found that they effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the
effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It is necessary to have these procedures in place in order to conduct the referendum in November 1994; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No useful purpose will be served by a delay of the effective date.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is amending its regulations governing mergers and combinations involving
Federal savings associations to implement sections 501 and 502 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991 (FDICIA). In general, the FDICIA amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) and to the Home
Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) ease previous restrictions on conversion transactions, and authorize Federally-chartered
savings associations to acquire and be acquired by other depository institutions insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), subject to specified conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS is amending and further broadening its regulations to authorize combinations involving Federal stock savings
associations and depository institutions that are not insured by the FDIC. The OTS also is amending its regulations
to authorize Federal mutual savings associations to combine with other types of depository institutions provided
that the transaction results in a mutual savings association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the OTS is amending its regulations governing mergers and application procedures to: specify the types
of transactions that require only an information filing with the OTS; specify the types of transactions that require
OTS approval of a notice or application, and the related time frames, and further clarify and consolidate OTS regulations
by incorporating the OTS's merger and transfer of assets policy statement into a single regulation.

I. Background and Summary of Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 18, 1992, the OTS issued notice of a proposal to amend the agency's regulations governing mergers and other
combinations to permit mergers, consolidations and transfer of asset and assumption of liability transactions
among savings associations and other FDIC-insured depository institutions in accordance with sections 501 and
502 of the FDICIA.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the OTS proposed changes to its regulations to allow Federal savings associations to convert directly
to state and national banks (while retaining Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) deposit insurance) in a so-called
``Sasser conversion,''
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and to permit any FDIC-insured depository institution that qualifies for Federal Home Loan Bank membership to convert
to a Federal savings association charter. The proposal also specified the types of transactions that would require
either prior notice or application to the OTS, and the time frames governing review of these filings. The proposal
did not include amendments to the merger regulations involving mutual savings associations. However, specific
comments were requested as to whether mutual savings associations should be permitted to merge directly with banks
without first undergoing a mutual-to stock conversion and what safeguards would be necessary for such transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the OTS proposed to streamline and consolidate its regulations by, among other things, eliminating unnecessary
portions of the OTS's merger and transfer of assets policy statement and incorporating the remainder in a better organized
fashion into the revised section 563.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS solicited public comments on all aspects of the proposal for a 30-day period. Upon consideration of all the
comments received during the comment period, the OTS is adopting the proposal with some modifications, discussed
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS received 10 comment letters in response to the proposal, including four from savings banks, two from savings
and loan holding companies, two from trade associations representing financial institutions, one from a law firm
representing financial institutions and one from the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB). The OTS has carefully
considered all of the comments received during the comment period. In addition, the OTS has reviewed the rulemakings
of other Federal banking agencies on related subjects, and has sought, to the maximum extent possible, to adopt consistent
provisions. The following is a discussion of the issues raised by the commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Mandatory Federal Home Loan Bank Membership for Converting Savings Associations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the proposal, section 5(f) of the HOLA requires Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLBank) membership for all Federal
savings associations, and FHLBank membership was consistently required of state-chartered savings associations
by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation as a condition of deposit insurance. In addition, after enactment
of the FIRREA, the OTS required resulting banks in thrift-to-bank charter conversions and Oakar transactions
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 in which no savings association survived the transaction to continue to hold the former savings association's FHLBank
stock in accordance with the requirements of the FHFB. Each commenter that addressed this issue objected to any regulation
that would continue this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As used herein, an ``Oakar'' transaction refers to a combination between a savings association and a bank that is excepted
from the moratorium on deposit insurance fund conversion set forth at section 5(d)(2)(A)(ii) of the FDIA by virtue
of section 5(d)(3) of the FDIA. See 12 U.S.C. 1815(d)(2)(A)(ii) and 1815(d)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since publication of the proposal, the FHFB advised the OTS that it will not require a savings association that has
converted to a bank charter to retain membership in the FHLBank system, nor will the FHFB require a non-FHLBank system
member that has acquired some or all of the assets of a savings association to become a member of the FHLBank system.
In light of the FHFB's views on this issue, the OTS advised the FHFB on November 20, 1992 that the OTS was discontinuing
its practice of imposing the condition that such institutions retain FHLBank stock. In addition, the OTS advised
the FHFB that in prior cases where the FHLBank stock condition was imposed, the OTS would not object if a bank seeks to
redeem its FHLBank stock and terminate its FHLBank membership. In March 1993, the OTS reiterated these positions
in promulgating a final regulation that will remove, in 1995, the regulatory requirement that state-chartered savings
associations have and maintain FHLBank membership.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the final rule does not require FHLBank membership of resulting institutions in the context of thrift-to-bank
mergers and charter conversions.

B. Issues Regarding Mutual Savings Associations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current OTS regulations generally provide that merger transactions involving Federal mutual savings associations
must result in a mutual form of savings association, unless the mutual institution converts to a stock savings association
as part of the transaction.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal did not set forth any amendments to these regulations, but did solicit comment as to whether mutual savings
associations should be permitted to merge with banks or other institutions other than in conjunction with a mutual-to-stock
conversion, and if permitted, what safeguards should be established with respect to these transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments addressing this issue unanimously opposed any regulation that would permit Federal mutual savings
associations to be acquired by commercial banks or other stock-form institutions without a prior or simultaneous
mutual-to-stock conversion by the mutual savings association. These commenters expressed the view that OTS regulations
adequately protect the interests of mutual accountholders
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 and direct acquisition resulting in a stock institution may jeopardize those protections. They also noted that the
FDICIA does not evidence any intent to change the current treatment of combinations involving mutual associations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS has recently issued an interim final regulation, with a request for comment, revising certain key provisions
in its mutual to stock conversion regulations. The amendments generally prohibit merger conversions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, where a mutual savings association converts to stock form and simultaneously merges into another stock form depository
institution) except in certain supervisory situations. In addition, OTS has proposed to add a ``convenience and
needs'' test to its standards for approving mutual to stock conversions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS agrees with these comments and, accordingly, the final regulations continue to prohibit Federal mutual associations
from combining with stock form institutions where the resulting institution is not a mutual savings association,
except in the context of a mutual to stock conversion, and subject to other limited exceptions. Nevertheless, as more
fully described below, the OTS has determined that Federal mutual savings associations may, in general, combine
with stock form institutions where the Federal mutual association is the resulting association. The final rule includes
revisions to 12 CFR 546.2 and 546.3 to effect these changes.

C. Review Period Under Section 10(s)(2) of the HOLA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal solicited comment on processing procedures and time frames, including whether applications subject
to section 10(s)(2) of the HOLA should be deemed ``filed'' when deemed complete under the OTS's general application
processing procedures in 12 CFR Part 516. Under the proposal, the 60-day review time for these applications would
not commence until an application is reviewed by the OTS and deemed complete under part 516. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters objected to the OTS's interpretation of the term ``filed'' in section 10(s) of the HOLA. These commenters
suggested that the review time frames for applications under section 10(s)(2) should commence when an application
is first submitted to the OTS, not when it is deemed complete. One commenter supported the proposal, noting that any
regulation providing different ``filed'' dates for applications under part 516 and section 10(s) of the HOLA would
serve no purpose and would create confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in more detail in Section III.D. below, the final rule adopts the proposed application review time frames.
To ensure uniform treatment of all transactional applications, the OTS believes applications subject to section
10(s)(2) of the HOLA should be processed, to the extent possible, consistently with all applications under part 516.
Also, the processing time frames in the rule are consistent with the procedures established by the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency for conversion applications by national banks under section 502(b) of the FDICIA.

This commenter asserted that although section 5(d)(3) of the FDIA requires the OTS to consider the factors set forth
in section 18(c) of the FDIA (the Bank Merger Act (BMA)) in acting upon an Oakar transaction, the BMA is not itself applicable
to such transactions. Therefore, according to the commenter, an application to engage in an Oakar transaction is
not an ``application for a deposit facility'' within the meaning of the CRA, and the CRA requirement that the OTS take
an institution's CRA record into account in its evaluation of an application for a deposit facility

We find the commenter's assertions to be unpersuasive. Section 5(d)(3) of the FDIA merely establishes an exception
to the general moratorium on insurance fund ``conversion transactions'' set forth at section 5(d)(2)(A)(ii) of
the FDIA. Section 5(d)(3) does not state that Oakar transactions are excepted from all otherwise applicable approval
requirements, and the BMA itself includes no exception from its plain language with respect to Oakar transactions.
Moreover, the authorization provided by section 10(s) of the HOLA is subject to section 5(d)(3) of the FDIA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and the BMA, and all other applicable laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS, after further consideration of its applications processing procedures, observes that the procedures in
part 516 of the OTS's regulations are intended to ensure that an application will not be deemed complete until expiration
of the public comment period and resolution of any protests or other significant issues raised during that period.
Accordingly, any challenges to a transaction on CRA grounds would be resolved prior to the commencement of the processing
time frames under section 10(s)(2) of the HOLA. The OTS has amended the publication procedures for applications under
&sect;563.22(a) to ensure that the public comment period has concluded before the OTS is required to make a completeness
determination regarding such applications.

E. Application Review Standards and Regulatory Streamlining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The OTS proposed to incorporate into revised &sect;563.22 the approval standards, definitional provisions and
other provisions of the OTS's merger and transfer of assets policy statement found at 12 CFR 571.5. The proposal requested
comment on whether any of the standards in &sect;571.5 should be streamlined, clarified or otherwise modified or
deleted in connection with their incorporation into &sect;563.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that some of the review criteria in &sect;571.5 went beyond the standards applicable to transactions
under sections 5(d)(3) of the FDIA and 10(s) of the HOLA, and therefore should not be considered by the OTS in reviewing
applications under these statutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 571.5 set forth not only the review standards for transactions under sections 5(d)(3) and 18(c) of the FDIA
and 10(s) of the HOLA, but also general safety and soundness considerations applicable to all transfer transactions
and combinations involving savings associations. Thus, the OTS believes it is appropriate to retain these review
criteria. However, certain of the detailed criteria addressed in &sect;571.5, for example those pertaining to retention
of attorneys and other professionals, tie-in transactions, and fees paid in connection with transactions, are considered
by OTS as part of the overall evaluation of the managerial and financial resources and future prospects of the savings
associations involved in a combination or transfer transaction. The OTS believes that the detail of certain criteria
is not necessary and that general standards are more appropriate for an evaluation of the safety and soundness of a
given transaction. Accordingly, &sect;563.22(d) of the final rule has been revised to incorporate streamlined
and consolidated review standards derived from &sect;571.5, and &sect;571.5 has been deleted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
One commenter requested that the OTS clarify whether section 10(s)(3) of the HOLA (and &sect;552.13(b)(1) as set
forth in the proposal) precludes transfer or consolidation transactions where a resulting institution would own
the shares of one or more constituent institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In OTS's view, section 10(s)(3) of the HOLA does not prohibit a Federal savings association from acquiring the stock
of another insured depository institution and holding the other depository institution as a subsidiary. Section
10(s) was designed to cure what had been viewed as a statutory impediment to mergers or other combinations between
a savings association and other types of insured depository institutions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 10(s) was not established to bar transactions that are permissible under other, existing authority. Moreover,
neither the text of section 502 of FDICIA nor its legislative history indicate that Congress intended section 10(s)(3)
to override any separate legal authority for such an acquisition.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary impediment was section 5(d)(3) of the HOLA, which, in pertinent part, authorizes the OTS to provide for
the merger of savings associations with other savings associations, but is silent as to whether savings associations
could merge with other types of depository institutions. For many years, the OTS, and its predecessor, the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, viewed the lack of express authorization for cross-industry mergers as, in effect, a prohibition
on such transactions.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal savings associations, therefore, may acquire the shares of another insured depository institution and
hold the acquired entity as a subsidiary if the legal authority for the transaction derives from a source other than
section 10(s) of the HOLA. Such legal authority may be found, for example, under the service corporation provisions
of the HOLA, and the OTS service corporation and operating subsidiary regulations.

Accordingly, the final regulations provide that a Federal savings association may ``combine'' with any depository
institution (subject to compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and certain other provisions), and
define the term ``combination'' as a ``merger or consolidation with another depository institution, or an acquisition
of all or substantially all of the assets or assumption of all or substantially all of the liabilities of a depository
institution by another depository institution.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned the OTS's authority to require any filing from a savings association proposing to convert
to a bank charter or merge or transfer all of its assets to a bank. This commenter also questioned the necessity of any
filing with the OTS in view of the requirement under the BMA that the OTS be provided with a copy of the application filed
with the regulatory agency of the resulting depository institution. The filing requirements in the regulations
as adopted enable the OTS, consistent with its broad responsibilities under the HOLA and other statutes, to ensure
safe and sound operation of savings associations, identify any pending or potential supervisory concerns or enforcement
actions involving the savings associations that are parties to the transaction, and, at a minimum, advise the appropriate
regulatory agency regarding these concerns. The procedures are not contrary to any of the provisions of section 5(d)
of the FDIA, and, in fact, represent a significant simplification of long-standing OTS application and approval
requirements, which have been upheld by the courts.

One commenter suggested that the OTS shorten the review period for applications submitted by savings associations,
where the association previously had sought expedited treatment, but the OTS had advised the association that it
was not eligible for expedited treatment. Under the final rule, such applications will be processed under standard
time frames regardless of prior filings. However, to the extent a previously filed notice provides the OTS with useful
information regarding a proposed transaction, it is likely that the OTS will be able to act on a subsequent, properly
filed application prior to expiration of the full 60-day review period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter inquired how the OTS would treat applications filed under &sect;563.22 that are awaiting OTS
action at the effective date of the amended regulation, and whether such applications would need to be re-filed in
accordance with the procedures adopted in the final rule. The commenter also inquired about the treatment that would
be accorded applications that were approved but not consummated prior to adoption of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both pending applications and proposed transactions that are now solely within the scope of new &sect;563.22(b)(1)
will be subject to the new procedures upon the effective date of the amendments. Other applications currently awaiting
OTS action will continue to be subject to the standards and procedures in effect at the time the applications were filed.
Previously approved transactions must be consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
OTS's approval order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As more fully discussed below, the final regulations implement section 502 of the FDICIA by authorizing Federal stock
associations to combine with any FDIC-insured depository institution, and by authorizing Federal mutual associations
to combine with any FDIC-insured depository institution, provided that a mutual association is the resulting institution.
In addition, the final regulations authorize certain combinations involving Federal associations and depository
institutions not insured by the FDIC. The final regulations specifically authorize Federal stock savings associations
to convert to state or national banks, and permit any stock-form depository institution that is, or is eligible to
become, a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank, to convert to a Federal stock savings association charter. Finally, the
OTS is amending its regulations governing the procedures regarding applications to engage in the above-described
actions, and has made various technical and conforming amendments.

A. Expansion of Permissible Combinations for Federal Stock Savings Associations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule revises 12 CFR 552.13(c) to permit Federal stock savings associations to combine with any depository
institution, upon compliance with appropriate application or notice requirements, described in Section III.D.
below. The rule also establishes standards for combinations, including standards that address compliance with
the asset composition requirements of section 5(c) of the HOLA and the qualified thrift lender requirements of section
10(m) of the HOLA, when a thrift acquires a bank. In addition, the regulation modifies and adds definitions for terms
used throughout amended sections 552.13 and 563.22 to implement the new provisions of the HOLA and the FDIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulation differs from the proposal in certain respects. The term ``acquire'' has been changed to ``combination,''
and expanded to include combinations involving depository institutions not insured by the FDIC. Also, the term ``combination''
has been clarified to include purchase and assumption transactions that involve all or substantially all of a depository
institution's assets or liabilities, rather than transactions of a lesser scope, such as branch sale transactions.
The definition of the term ``combination'' reflects the OTS's position that the definition of the term ``acquire''
at section 10(s)(3) does not preclude a Federal savings association from holding another insured depository institution
as a subsidiary, pursuant to a separate source of authority to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10(s)(1) of the HOLA states that Federal savings associations may acquire or be acquired by any insured depository
institution, subject to sections 5(d)(3) and 18(c) of the FDIA, and all other applicable laws. The OTS has concluded
that the reference to section 5(d)(3) of the FDIA does not mean that section 5(d)(3) must be applicable in order for
a combination transaction to be permissible. The grant of authority in section 10(s)(1) of the HOLA to Federal savings
associations to acquire or be acquired by another insured depository institution simply requires that any Federal
savings association that proposes such a transaction comply with all applicable laws. Section 10(s)(1) was not intended
to withhold from Federal associations the authority to engage in transactions exempted from the FIRREA moratorium
on conversion transactions under other provisions of the FDIA,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 or in transactions that are not subject to the moratorium in the first place (for example, because the transaction
involves two SAIF-insured savings associations, or occurs after expiration of the moratorium). The OTS has clarified
the final regulation accordingly.

The final regulation expands the categories of depository institutions with which Federal stock associations have
the power to merge from only FDIC-insured depository institutions to any depository institution. Federal stock
associations have been authorized to acquire or be acquired by non-FDIC insured depository institutions in purchase
and assumption transactions since 1985.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The OTS has concluded that continuing to require such transactions to be accomplished through purchase and assumption
transactions, rather than through merger transactions elevates form over substance, and may impose unnecessary
expenses and complications on Federal stock associations that propose to engage in transactions with uninsured
depository institutions.

Where a Federal stock association proposes to merge with an uninsured depository institution, and the Federal stock
association would survive the transaction, the Federal stock association would be required to seek approval from
the FDIC under section 18(c)(1) of the FDIA, as well as from the OTS under the transfer of assets regulations at 12 CFR
563.22(c). If the Federal stock association is not the resulting institution, the association must obtain OTS approval
under 12 CFR 563.22(c), and provide any required notices to depositors, and to the FDIC.

The OTS notes, however, that the concerns regarding the protection of mutual accountholders' interests in the acquisitions
of Federal mutual associations do not arise when the Federal mutual association is the acquiring/surviving entity.
Accordingly, the OTS is amending 12 CFR 546.2, governing mergers involving Federal mutual associations, to permit
Federal mutual associations to merge with FDIC-insured depository institutions, as well as non-FDIC insured depository
institutions, where a mutual savings association is the resulting entity. This treatment parallels the treatment
of Federal stock associations. These combinations also would be subject to the same statutory and regulatory approval
standards as apply to stock form associations engaging in a comparable transaction, described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 546.2 has not previously addressed the ability of Federal mutual associations to combine with other institutions
in purchase and assumption transactions. The OTS has amended &sect;546.2 to provide specific authority for Federal
mutual associations to combine with other entities in purchase and assumption transactions, subject to the same
limitations that apply in the case of merger transactions involving Federal mutual associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The OTS regulations for Federal mutual savings associations have not been amended to authorize specifically the
conversion of Federal mutual savings associations to state mutual savings banks, because such conversions are specifically
authorized under section 5(i)(3) of the HOLA. Federal mutual savings associations proposing to convert to state
mutual savings banks are required to notify the OTS or obtain OTS approval as described in section III.D., below.

The OTS is amending 12 CFR 552.2&hyph;6 to permit, with prior OTS approval, any stock-form depository institution
that is, or is eligible to become, a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank, to convert to a Federal stock savings association
charter. The depository institution, at the time of the conversion, must have deposits insured by the FDIC. In addition,
the depository institution, in accomplishing the conversion, must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations,
including, without limitation, the insurance fund conversion moratorium provisions set forth at section 5(d) of
the FDIA.

The OTS has broad legal authority with respect to Federal savings associations under section 5(a) of the HOLA, which
authorizes the Director of the OTS, under such regulations as the Director may prescribe, to,

, provide for the organization, incorporation, examination, operation, and regulation of Federal savings associations.
Section 5(a) of the HOLA provides the OTS with plenary authority over Federal savings associations, and, as the Supreme
Court has noted, it would be difficult for Congress to give a broader mandate.

The OTS notes that section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA provides specific authorization for ``[a]ny savings association which
is, or is eligible to become, a member of a Federal home loan bank'' to ``convert into a Federal savings association,''
subject to such regulations as the Director may prescribe. Immediately prior to the enactment of FIRREA, section
5(i)(1) of the HOLA permitted any ``institution'' which is, or is eligible to become, a member of a Federal home loan
bank to convert to a Federal savings and loan association or Federal savings bank, subject to the regulations of the
FHLBB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIRREA revised the language of section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA from any ``institution'' which is, or is eligible to become,
a member of a Federal home loan bank, to any ``savings association'' that met such criteria. However, the OTS's review
of the legislative history of FIRREA has revealed no intent on the part of Congress in the FIRREA to limit the types of
depository institutions that may convert to a Federal savings association charter. Instead, it appears that the
change in the ``institution'' terminology in section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA was inadvertent, and occurred when the term
``insured institution,'' occurring throughout the HOLA, was changed in FIRREA to ``savings association.'' Accordingly,
the use of the OTS's authority under section 5(a) of the HOLA to broaden the class of depository institutions that are
eligible for a Federal charter is not inconsistent with the FIRREA amendments to section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New section 552.2&hyph;6 enables commercial banks and other depository institutions to accomplish directly what
they have previously been able to accomplish indirectly. For example, in many cases, a state bank or other depository
institution may, under state law, convert to a state-chartered savings bank, or a state-chartered savings association,
which may, consistent with state law and section 5(i) of the HOLA (or, in some cases, section 5(o) of the HOLA), convert
to a Federal savings association or a Federal savings bank. Similarly, a commercial bank or other depository institution
may cause the chartering of a Federal association, and then transfer its assets and liabilities to the savings association.

The OTS believes that federal statutes should be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with their purpose.
In so doing, the substance, not merely the form of a transaction, is key. It is clear that no federal statutory barrier
exists to the ultimate accomplishment of conversions of depository institutions to Federal thrift charters, provided
that all applicable chartering and insurance requirements are met. Thus, absent compelling reasons to the contrary,
to read the HOLA as implicitly requiring a multi-step process to accomplish these types of charter conversions would
impose unnecessary expenses and complications upon depository institutions that wish to operate as Federal savings
associations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The classes of depository institutions that are permitted to convert to a Federal stock association charter under
&sect;552.2&hyph;6 is broader than set forth in the proposed version of the regulation, which addressed only conversions
by FDIC-insured depository institutions. The OTS believes that there are no compelling legal or policy reasons why
stock-form depository institutions not insured by the FDIC should not be permitted to convert directly to a Federal
savings association.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 However, these institutions must meet the requirements for Federal Home Loan Bank membership, receive FDIC insurance
of accounts prior to consummation of the conversion, and otherwise comply with all applicable statutes and regulations.

The OTS is not, at this time, adopting a corresponding regulation that would authorize mutual-form depository institutions
to convert to Federal mutual savings associations. The OTS may, in the future, consider promulgating a regulation
authorizing such conversions. The OTS notes, however, that mutual-form state chartered savings banks that are insured
by the Bank Insurance Fund are authorized to convert to Federal mutual savings banks, pursuant to section 5(o) of the
HOLA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, the FDIA requires prior OTS approval of combinations between savings associations and other types of FDIC-insured
depository institutions where the acquiring, assuming, or resulting institution is a savings association. In such
transactions, the OTS will continue to require an application under amended &sect;563.22(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under previous regulations, any savings association that proposed to convert to a bank in a Sasser transaction or
be acquired by a bank in an Oakar transaction was required to file a transfer of assets application with the OTS.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 The OTS continues to believe that an application process requiring prior written approval is necessary in certain
situations, discussed below. However, with respect to Oakar transactions and other combinations between a thrift
and a bank in which no savings association survives, the OTS's experience has indicated that a notification requirement
would be sufficient. The OTS will advise the appropriate Federal banking agency of any supervisory concerns, enforcement
actions and other relevant information regarding the institution.

Any savings association that proposes to convert to a bank charter in a Sasser conversion must file a notification
or application with the OTS, depending on whether the savings association meets the requirements for expedited treatment
under &sect;516.3(a). Specifically, savings associations that qualify for expedited treatment under &sect;516.3(a)(1)
will be eligible to use the notification procedure set forth at &sect;563.22(h)(1) in order to engage in a Sasser conversion.
Savings associations that do not qualify for such treatment will be required to file an application in order to engage
in a Sasser conversion. Such applications will be subject to the general application processing timeframes.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 The OTS notes that this procedure represents a significant reduction in burden from the prior procedures, under which
every savings association that proposed to undertake a Sasser conversion was required to file a detailed application.

The proposal included a notification requirement for all savings associations undertaking a Sasser transaction.
Based on additional experience, the OTS is requiring an application from savings associations that fail to qualify
for expedited processing and propose to undertake a Sasser transaction, because such associations may, in certain
cases, present compliance or safety and soundness concerns that may warrant denial or conditioning of the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating applications proposing Sasser conversions, the OTS will assess the applicable factors set forth in
&sect;563.22(d)(1), and whether the conversion may have a negative effect on the safety and soundness of the association
or present a risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 563.22(b) and (c) have been amended and a new &sect;563.22(h) has been added to the regulations setting forth
special requirements and procedures for transactions subject to &sect;&sect;563.22 (b) and (c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, amended &sect;563.22(b)(1) of the final rule requires prior notification to the OTS in accordance
with new &sect;563.22(h)(1) of Sasser conversions of savings associations that meet the criteria for expedited
treatment under &sect;516.3(a), and combinations between savings associations and FDIC-insured depository institutions
(such as Oakar transactions) where no savings association will survive consummation of the transaction. The notification
must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the conversion or combination, but not later than the
date on which an application relating to the proposed transaction is filed with the primary regulator of the resulting
association. The rule also provides that, upon request or on its own initiative, the OTS may shorten the 30-day prior
notification period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New &sect;563.22(h)(1) requires the submission of either a letter describing material information regarding the
transaction or a copy of a filing submitted to the regulatory agency of the resulting institution that must approve
the transaction. The rule does not require OTS approval or clearance of such transactions prior to their consummation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the amendments to &sect;563.22(b), the OTS has determined that it is appropriate to revise its application
requirements for voluntary dissolutions of Federal associations set forth at 12 CFR 546.4. Amended &sect;546.4
provides that Federal associations that combine with a bank in a purchase and assumption transaction will not be required
to file a voluntary dissolution application where the transaction involves the transfer of all of the Federal association's
assets and liabilities. The OTS has determined that requiring a voluntary dissolution application would have eliminated
any streamlining arising from the notification process in those circumstances. The Federal stock association will
still be required under &sect;552.13 to surrender its charter upon completion of the transaction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amended &sect;563.22(c) requires prior notice or application to the OTS in accordance with new &sect;563.22(h)(2)
for the following categories of transactions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Purchases of assets by a savings association that do not require OTS approval under the BMA and &sect;563.22(a);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Bulk sales of less than all or substantially all of the assets of a savings association; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Transactions in which a savings association transfers less than all or substantially all of its deposit liabilities
to a bank or other depository institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Bulk assumptions or transfers of non-deposit liabilities by a savings association; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Combinations involving savings associations and depository institutions other than insured depository institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS believes that an abbreviated procedure is appropriate for these types of transactions, provided that the
savings association is well capitalized, and otherwise qualifies for ``expedited treatment'' under part 516. Accordingly,
under new &sect;563.22(h)(2)(i), an expedited notice procedure is available for all five of the foregoing categories
of transactions where all constituent savings associations meet the conditions for ``expedited treatment'' under
12 CFR 516.3(a). Notices under this provision of the rule would be deemed approved automatically 30 days after receipt,
unless the OTS determines that an application is required.

As is the case with respect to any notice receiving expedited treatment under &sect;516.3(a), the OTS may impose appropriate

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under new &sect;&sect;563.22(h)(2)(ii) and 563.22(h)(2)(iii), a standard application procedure must be followed
where any constituent savings association does not meet the criteria for ``expedited treatment'' under &sect;516.3(a),
or where a notice filed under &sect;563.22(h)(2)(i) is incomplete or otherwise does not satisfy the notice requirements.
These applications will be subject to the ``standard'' review periods set forth in part 516, with certain exceptions.
As with other applications, the OTS is required to notify an applicant within 30 calendar days after proper submission
of an application whether it is ``sufficient'' or ``complete,'' and what additional information is required, if
any, in order to render the submission sufficient, or that the submission is materially deficient and will not be processed.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the 60-day period for review for an application under these provisions commences on the date the OTS determines

(g) If a plan of combination provides for a resulting Federal mutual savings association's name or location to be changed,
its charter shall be amended accordingly. If the resulting institution is a Federal mutual savings association,
the effective date of the combination shall be the date specified in the approval; if the resulting institution is
not a Federal savings association, the effective date shall be that prescribed under applicable law. Approval of
a merger automatically cancels the Federal charter of a Federal association that is a disappearing institution as

resulting institution shall be a continuation of the entity which absorbed the disappearing institutions. All rights
and obligations of the disappearing institutions shall remain unimpaired, and the resulting institution shall,

of the conversion, has deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and provided further, that
the depository institution, in accomplishing the conversion, complies with all applicable statutes and regulations,
including, without limitation, section 5(d) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The resulting Federal stock association
must conform within the time prescribed by the OTS to the requirements of section 5(c) of the Home Owners' Loan Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) No savings association may, without application to and approval by the Office: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Combine with any insured depository institution, if the acquiring or resulting institution is to be a savings
association; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assume liability to pay any deposit made in, any insured depository institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) No savings association may, without notifying the Office, as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Combine with another insured depository institution where a savings association is not the resulting institution;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of a savings association that meets the conditions for expedited treatment under &sect;516.3(a)
of this chapter, convert, directly or indirectly, to a national or state bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No savings association that does not meet the conditions for expedited treatment under &sect;516.3(a) of this
chapter may, directly or indirectly, convert to a national or state bank without prior application to and approval
of the Office, as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) No savings association may make any transfer (excluding transfers subject to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section)
without notice or application to the Office, as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. For purposes of this
paragraph, the term ``transfer'' means purchases or sales of assets or liabilities in bulk not made in the ordinary
course of business including, but not limited to, transfers of assets or savings account liabilities, purchases
of assets, and assumptions of deposit accounts or other liabilities, and combinations with a depository institution
other than an insured depository institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(1) In determining whether to confer approval for a transaction under paragraphs (a), (b)(2), or (c) of this section,
the Office shall take into account the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The capital level of any resulting savings association; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The financial and managerial resources of the constituent institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The future prospects of the constituent institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The convenience and needs of the communities to be served; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The conformity of the transaction to applicable law, regulation, and supervisory policies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Factors relating to the fairness of and disclosure concerning the transaction, including, but not limited to:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Equitable treatment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transaction should be equitable to all concerned_savings account holders, borrowers, creditors and stockholders
(if any) of each savings association_giving proper recognition of and protection to their respective legal rights
and interests. The transaction will be closely reviewed for fairness where the transaction does not appear to be the
result of arms' length bargaining or, in the case of a stock savings association, where controlling stockholders
are receiving different consideration from other stockholders. No finder's or similar fee should be paid to any officer,
director, or controlling person of a savings association which is a party to the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Full disclosure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The filing should make full disclosure of all written or oral agreements or understandings by which any person or company
will receive, directly or indirectly, any money, property, service, release of pledges made, or other thing of value,
whether tangible or intangible, in connection with the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compensation to officers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compensation, including deferred compensation, to officers, directors and controlling persons of the disappearing
savings association by the resulting institution or an affiliate thereof should not be in excess of a reasonable amount,
and should be commensurate with their duties and responsibilities. The filing should fully justify the compensation
to be paid to such persons. The transaction will be particularly scrutinized where any of such persons is to receive
a material increase in compensation above that paid by the disappearing savings association prior to the commencement
of negotiations regarding the proposed transaction. An increase in compensation in excess of the greater of 15% or
$10,000 gives rise to presumptions of unreasonableness and sale of control. In the case of such an increase, evidence
sufficient to rebut such presumptions should be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Advisory boards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Advisory board members should be elected for a term not exceeding one year. No advisory board fees should be paid to
salaried officers or employees of the resulting savings association. The filing should describe and justify the
duties and responsibilities and any compensation paid to any advisory board of the resulting savings association
that consists of officers, directors or controlling persons of the disappearing institution, particularly if the
disappearing institution experienced significant supervisory problems prior to the transaction. No advisory
board fees should exceed the director fees paid by the resulting savings association. Advisory board fees that are
in excess of 115 percent of the director fees paid by the disappearing savings association prior to commencement of
negotiations regarding the transaction give rise to presumptions of unreasonableness and sale of control unless
sufficient evidence to rebut such presumptions is submitted. Rebuttal evidence is not required if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The advisory board fees do not exceed the fee that advisory board members of the resulting institution receive
for each monthly meeting attended or $150, whichever is greater; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the advisory board fees do not exceed $100 per meeting attended for disappearing savings associations with assets
greater than $10,000,000 or $50 per meeting attended for disappearing savings associations with assets of $10,000,000
or less, based on a schedule of 12 meetings per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The accounting and tax treatment of the transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) Fees paid and professional services rendered in connection with the transaction.

(2) In conferring approval of a transaction under paragraph (a) of this section, the Office also will consider the
competitive impact of the transaction, including whether:

 SIP, which includes the Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program, as revised by the State of Montana on March 19,
1993, and submitted by the Governor of Montana to EPA on May 24, 1993, with the exception of contingency measures. Final
technical corrections to the SIP were sent to EPA with a letter dated June 3, 1994. This submittal replaced earlier
submittals, detailed as follows:

The Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP was originally adopted by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences (MBHES) on November 15, 1991,
and submitted to EPA by the Governor on November 25, 1991. To address deficiencies identified by EPA, commitments
were adopted by the State after a public hearing on December 21, 1992, and submitted to EPA on January 13, 1993, as additional
tasks to be completed to correct the deficiencies in the Libby and statewide SIP. The commitments relevant to the moderate
PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area SIP requirements due November 15, 1991, were fulfilled through SIP revisions adopted by the MBHES
on March 19, 1993, and submitted by the Governor of Montana to EPA on May 24, 1993. In his cover letter, the Governor said
that this May 24, 1993, submittal should replace the documents submitted in November 1991. Final technical corrections
to the SIP were sent to EPA in a letter dated June 3, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The May 24, 1993, submittal also included contingency measure provisions. In a May 27, 1994, letter from Douglas M.
Skie (EPA) to Jeff Chaffee (Montana Air Quality Bureau, MAQB), EPA advised the State that additional language concerning
triggering of the contingency measures would be needed in the local regulations. EPA will propose separate action
on the contingency measures once the State has incorporated the necessary changes, and submitted the revised SIP
element to EPA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-66). In today's
action, EPA is granting approval of those elements of the Libby PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. EPA also must determine whether a
submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565).
EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. EPA attempts to make completeness
determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of
law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after receipt of the submission.

To entertain public comment on the implementation plan for Libby, the State of Montana, after providing adequate
notice, held a public hearing on November 15, 1991, to address the local air pollution control program and the Libby
SIP. Following the public hearing, the local air pollution control plan and the Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP were adopted by the State. The Governor of Montana submitted the SIP to EPA on November 25, 1991. The SIP submittal
was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V. The submittal was found to be complete, and a letter dated April 29, 1992, was forwarded to the Governor
indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to EPA comments regarding PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIPs for other Montana nonattainment areas, the State included commitments with the November 25, 1991, Libby submittal
to address statewide deficiencies (New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration regulations, test
methods, and an operating permit program), along with Libby-specific commitments regarding revising the attainment
and maintenance demonstrations to properly handle background concentrations and to correct wood-burning program
calculations, clarifying that the state emergency episode plan applies in Libby, and adopting contingency measures.
In an October 7, 1992, letter from Doug Skie, EPA to Jeff Chaffee, MAQB, EPA notified the State that its commitments
would need to be taken through the public hearing process, which would delay EPA's approvability determination.
The State held a public hearing on December 21, 1992, and resubmitted the commitments as an official Governor's submittal
in a letter dated January 13, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 19, 1993, the State of Montana, after providing adequate notice, held a public hearing to entertain public
comment on revisions to the Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP to satisfy several of the Governor's commitments, as discussed above. Following the public hearing, the revisions
to the local air pollution control plan and the Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP were adopted by the State. The Governor of Montana submitted the revised SIP to EPA on May 24, 1993. This submittal
was deemed to be complete six months later on November 24, 1993. The Acting Administrator of EPA Region VIII sent a letter
to the Governor on January 4, 1994, documenting that the submittal was deemed to be complete, and that EPA did review
the May 24, 1993, Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP submittal and found that it met the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The Governor's submittal
letter stated that this new submittal should replace the November 25, 1991, SIP submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, the State has fulfilled all remaining Governor's commitments. EPA is preparing separate actions
on submittals addressing the statewide commitments (New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration
regulations, test methods, and an operating permit program). A detailed description of the Libby commitments is
contained in the TSD for this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this final rule action, EPA is announcing its approval of the revised Montana PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

2. Accurate Emission Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current
inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emission inventory
also should include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. Because
the submission of such inventories is a necessary adjunct to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration
that the area cannot practicably attain), the emission inventories must be received with the submission (see 57 FR
13539). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Libby's base year emissions inventory was developed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 31, 1987, through November 30, 1988. The results were as follows. Annually, area sources account for 70.8%
of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, with re-entrained road dust the largest contributor at 62.4%. Residential wood burning, another area
source, accounts for 7.6% of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions in the Libby area. The Stimson Lumber Company
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sawmill and plywood plant is the largest point source, contributing 29.2% of the Libby area emissions. Two-thirds
of its contribution is attributable to fugitive dust.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The emission inventory shows that the emissions are seasonal, with re-entrained road dust the primary source in spring
and summer. Industry is the most important source category in the fall and winter. However, fugitive dust accounts
for a large portion of the industrial emissions: 56.6% in the summer, 48.2% in the fall, and 18.2% in the winter. Re-entrained
road dust is the major area source during the spring (83.7%), summer (53.9%), and fall (41.7%), and residential wood
combustion is the major area source in the winter (27.3%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is approving the emissions inventory because it is accurate and comprehensive and provides a sufficient basis
for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements of sections
172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels which exceed the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The General Preamble contains guidance
addressing how EPA intends to implement section 189(e) (57 FR 13539&hyph;13540 and 13541&hyph;13542). An analysis
of air quality and emissions data for the Libby nonattainment area indicates that exceedances of the NAAQS are attributable
chiefly to direct particulate emissions from re-entrained road dust and residential wood burning (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 area sources). Neither the emissions inventory nor the CMB analysis for Libby revealed any major stationary sources
of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 precursors. Consequently, EPA has determined that major sources of precursors of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 do not contribute significantly to PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels in excess of the NAAQS. The consequence of this finding is to exclude any such sources from the applicability
of PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area control requirements. Further discussion of the analyses and supporting rationale for EPA's
finding are contained in the TSD accompanying this notice. Note that while EPA is making a general finding for this
area, today's finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources
in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area.
EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing the effect of such potential changes in the significance of precursor
emissions in an area.

6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones which are to
be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined in section
171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). RFP is defined in section 171(l) as
such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by Part D or may reasonably
be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable
date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While section 189(c) plainly provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved until an area is redesignated
attainment, it is silent in indicating the starting point for counting the first 3-year period or how many milestones
must be initially addressed. In the General Preamble, EPA addressed the statutory gap in the starting point for counting
the 3-year milestones, indicating that it would begin from the due date for the applicable implementation plan revision
containing the control measures for the area (i.e., November 15, 1991, for initial moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As to the number of milestones, EPA believes that at least two milestones must be initially addressed. Thus, submittals
to address the SIP revisions due on November 15, 1991, for the initial moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas must demonstrate that at least two milestones will be achieved (1st milestone: November 15,
1991, through November 15, 1994; 2nd milestone: November 15, 1994, through November 15, 1997).

For the initial PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas that demonstrate timely attainment, the emissions reduction progress made between the SIP
submittal (due date of November 15, 1991) and the attainment date will satisfy the first quantitative milestone.
See 57 FR 13539. For areas that demonstrate timely attainment of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS, the milestones beyond the attainment achievement date should, at a minimum, provide for continued maintenance
of the standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 189(c) provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved ``until the area is redesignated attainment.''
However, this endpoint for quantitative milestones is speculative because redesignation of an area as attainment
is contingent upon several factors and future events. Therefore, EPA believes it is reasonable for States to initially
address at least the first two milestones. Addressing two milestones will ensure that the State continues to maintain
the NAAQS beyond the attainment date for at least some period during which an area could be redesignated attainment.
However, in all instances, additional milestones must be addressed if an area is not redesignated attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated previously, the SIP for the Libby nonattainment area demonstrates attainment of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. The SIP also demonstrates that the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS will be maintained in future years by predicting a 24-hour design concentration of 137.1

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the year 1998. Therefore, EPA is approving the submittal as meeting the quantitative milestone requirement currently
due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assurance that milestones and reasonable further progress will be achieved is based upon the State adopting and
implementing the particular control measures contained in the SIP which are addressed in Section II.A.3, ``RACM
(including RACT),'' of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, once a milestone has passed, the State will have to demonstrate that the milestone was, in fact, achieved
for the Libby area as provided in section 189(c)(2) of the Act. The State of Montana's PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP indicates that the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences (MDHES) and the Lincoln County Health
Department (LCHD) will submit to EPA a milestone report consistent with federal guidelines by December 31, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All exceedances of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard will be evaluated and a determination made as to the source of the exceedance. Changes in the air quality program
to prevent further exceedances and a timetable for implementation will be developed. Any other EPA requirements
for RFP reports will be incorporated as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Enforceability Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6) and 110(a)(2)(A)
of the Act and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in
a September 23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions also must contain a program to provide for enforcement of control
measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific control measures contained in the SIP are addressed above in section II.A.3, ``RACM (including RACT).''
The Lincoln County air pollution control ordinances, as included in the SIP, are legally enforceable by LCHD. There
are penalties for noncompliance with the mandatory solid fuel burning device regulation that are $25 for the third
and subsequent violations. There are also penalties for violation of any provision of the open burning regulation
that are: a fine not less than $10 and not more than $200 for each offense, except for burning hazardous wastes (as defined
by 40 CFR part 261), which carries a penalty of a fine not to exceed $10,000 for each offense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program and the associated local regulations are also enforceable by the
MDHES, if the LCHD fails to administer the program. Since the program has been approved by the MBHES in accordance with
section 75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Clean Air Act and effectuated by a MBHES order, and since the MDHES can enforce
MBHES orders, the MDHES has independent enforcement powers. Enforcement provisions are found in the Clean Air Act
of Montana, sections 75&hyph;2&hyph;401&hyph;429, Montana Code Annotated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission limits for the Stimson Lumber Company facility are enforceable by the MDHES through air quality permit

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2627&hyph;M with a final modification date of July 25, 1991. Section 75&hyph;2&hyph;401 of the Montana Clean Air
Act allows the MDHES to seek civil penalties for a violation of a permit limitation. Administrative Rules of Montana
(ARM) 16.8.1112 allows the MDHES to revoke a permit for a violation of a permit limitation. These regulations are contained
in the ARM 16.8.101 through 16.8.1602 and violations of these rules are punishable by civil penalties in an amount
up to $10,000 per day and criminal penalties in an amount up to $1,000 per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State relies on a local government for the implementation of any plan provision, then, according to section 110(a)(2)(E)(iii)
of the Act, the State must provide necessary assurances that the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation
of such plan provision. A State would have responsibility to ensure adequate implementation when, for example, the
State has the authority and resources to implement the provision, and the local entity has failed to do so.

The Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program was established in accordance with the requirements of section
75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Clean Air Act, as amended (1991). A stipulation between the MDHES, the Lincoln
County Commission and the Libby City Council was signed on March 18, 1993, to delineate responsibilities and authorities
between the MDHES and the local authorities. On March 19, 1993, the MBHES held a public hearing and (a) approved the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The ordinances, stipulation, and board order were submitted to EPA with the Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also submitted a State Assistant Attorney General's opinion interpreting the authority of the MDHES to
enforce any state and local air quality provisions if a local air quality program fails to do so. In practice, the MBHES
issues a board order when it approves a local program or amendments to a program. Since the Montana Clean Air Act authorizes
the MDHES to enforce board orders issued by the MBHES, the MDHES has the authority to assume jurisdiction over, and
implement, a local program so approved. However, the Montana Clean Air Act also requires a hearing before the MBHES
before such an assumption of jurisdiction and authority can be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

and funding intended to support effective implementation of the control measures.

8. Contingency Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIPs that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544. These measures
were required to be submitted by November 15, 1993, for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures
should consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's control strategy. These measures must take
effect without further action by the State or EPA, upon EPA's determination that the area has failed to make RFP or attain
the PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Libby nonattainment area SIP contains contingency measures that address re-entrained road dust (use of liquid
de-icer and expansion of sanding and sweeping area to Air Pollution Control District boundaries) and residential
wood combustion (prohibiting burning except under specified permits for the entire period between October 1 and
March 31 each year). In a May 27, 1994, letter from Doug Skie, EPA, to Jeff Chaffee, MAQB, EPA advised the State that additional
language was needed in the triggering mechanism for the contingency measures. The State is working with the local
governments and health department to adopt the necessary changes. EPA will take separate action on the Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contingency measures. See the TSD for this action for a more detailed discussion of the contingency measure deficiencies.

III. Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP submitted to EPA on May 24, 1993, with final technical corrections dated June 3, 1994, for the Libby, Montana nonattainment
area, with the exception of the contingency measures. Among other things, the State of Montana has demonstrated that
the Libby moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area will attain the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. EPA is also approving the Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program, which was included
in the Libby SIP submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because EPA considers this action noncontroversial and anticipates no adverse comments, this final approval is
made without prior proposal. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective October 31, 1994 unless, by September 29, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this
action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received,
the public is advised that this action will be effective October 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted, additional submittals for the initial moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, nonattainment new source review program requirements) are due independent of the SIP requirements addressed in
this action. EPA will determine the adequacy of any such submittal as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OMB has exempted this action from review under Executive Order 12866.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of a state
action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 16, 1994, the final rule establishing the requirements for reformulated gasoline (RFG), and the anti-dumping
provisions for conventional gasoline, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 59 FR 7716. In response to this final rule, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) received numerous questions
regarding the Agency's plans for implementing and assuring compliance with the RFG and anti-dumping regulations.
The Agency has prepared a document which responds to these questions, titled ``Reformulated Gasoline and Anti-Dumping
Question and Answers_July 1, 1994.'' This notice announces the availability of the RFG/anti-dumping regulations
question and answer document, and provides instructions for accessing this document, and other RFG-related documents,
on the Technology Transfer Network Bulletin Board System (TTNBBS). These instructions were widely distributed
on July 1, 1994; however, we are publishing this notice for the benefit of interested persons not on our mailing list.
Finally, it is our intention to make available on the TTNBBS, on a periodic basis, responses to any additional questions
received by the Agency.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region II, announces the deletion of the Wide Beach Development site
from the NPL. The NPL is Appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP),
which EPA promulgated pursuant to Section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act (CERCLA), as amended. EPA and the State of New York have determined that all appropriate Hazardous Substance Response
Trust Fund (Fund)-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented and that no further cleanup by responsible
parties is appropriate. Moreover, EPA and the State of New York have determined that remedial actions conducted at
the site to date have been protective of public health, welfare, and the environment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The site to be deleted from the NPL is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wide Beach Development site, Brant, New York.

The closing date for comments on the Notice of Intent to Delete was April 30, 1994. EPA received two comment letters.
One commentor suggested that deleting the site from the NPL at this time is premature, because he believes that an on-site
wetland was not properly restored and because the owner of the restored wetland has cut down some trees and shrubs located
on the wetland. The commentor also suggested that the site not be deleted from the NPL since a number of contractual
claims have not been resolved with the remedial action contractor. The second commentor expressed concern about
the possible instability of the treated soil that was used as fill on a portion of her property. This commentor also
expressed concern about possible problems disposing of the treated soil, in the event that a home were to be built on
her property. EPA's response to the first commentor is that the design of the wetlands restoration was performed by
an experienced landscape architect and biologist and that the restored wetland is the functional equivalent of the
original wetland. EPA also noted that, because of its small size, this wetland is not covered by New York State wetland
regulations; and since it is an isolated wetland and of limited size, disturbances of up to one acre do not require a
federal permit. Therefore, the land owner's removal of trees and shrubs from the restored wetland is not in violation
of state or federal wetland regulations. In addition, EPA indicated that, since the unresolved claims are contractual
issues, they are not relevant to deleting the site from the NPL. To the second commentor, EPA noted that the treated
soil has been stable since 1991, and that, since the treated soil is nonhazardous, it could be disposed of in the same
manner as any other excavated, nonhazardous soils. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA identifies sites which appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and
it maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of Fund-financed remedial actions.
Any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely event that conditions
at the site warrant such action. Section 300.425 (e)(3) of the NCP states that Fund-financed actions may be taken at
sites deleted from the NPL. Deletion of a site from the NPL does not affect responsible party liability or impede EPA's
efforts to recover costs associated with response efforts.

would provide a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay for such services. The revisions below amend
the rules to permit facilities that provide substantial free or below cost medical services but nonetheless cannot
receive credit for such services under current requirements with an alternative method of compliance that will enable
them to fulfill their uncompensated services obligations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 4, 1993, the Secretary of Health and Human Services published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing
to revise the rules governing what is popularly known as the Hill-Burton uncompensated services program. 58 FR 58828.
Health care facilities covered by the program received construction assistance under two titles of the Public Health
Service Act, Title VI (the ``Hill-Burton Act'', 42 U.S.C. 291, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and Title XVI (42 U.S.C. 300q, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). Under both titles, facilities receiving construction assistance have been required, as a condition of receiving
the construction assistance, to provide an assurance that ``there will be available in the facility or portion thereof
to be constructed or modernized a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor *&blank;*&blank;*.''
42 U.S.C. 291c(e)(2). See also 42 U.S.C. 300s-1(b)(1)(K)(ii). This assurance is known as the ``uncompensated services
assurance.''

Background of the Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The groundwork of the present uncompensated services compliance requirements was laid by comprehensive regulations
that were issued in 1979. 44 FR 29372 (May 18, 1979). The 1979 regulations established numerous compliance requirements
for uncompensated services programs. These included requirements for a minimum level of uncompensated services
to be provided by facilities, an annual compliance level (ACL) of uncompensated services to be provided, make-up
of any deficit in meeting the ACL, national eligibility criteria for determining who is unable to pay, notice requirements,
requirements regarding the timing and documentation of eligibility determinations, reporting and recordkeeping
requirements, and so on.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When experience with the 1979 regulations showed that they created substantial compliance problems for a number
of public facilities, which were amassing large deficits despite serving large numbers of indigent patients on a
free or below cost basis, the regulations were amended. A compliance alternative for public facilities, which is
codified at 42 CFR 124.513, was created. 51 FR 33208 (Sept. 18, 1986). The public facility compliance alternative
provides that a publicly owned and operated facility or quasi-public facility may be certified if it provides health
services to eligible persons under a program of discounted health services and either received for the past three
fiscal years at least 10 percent of its total operating revenue from state and/or local sources to cover operating
deficits attributable to the provision of discounted health services, or provided in those fiscal years uncompensated
services or free or discounted health services in an amount equal to or greater than twice the facility's annual compliance
level. The facility must comply with separate reporting and recordkeeping requirements and is required only to comply
with the requirements relating to certified facilities. A facility may make up previously assessed deficits by showing
that it met the conditions for certification in the deficit period; a Title VI facility may also make up a previously
assessed deficit by remaining certified after its original period of obligation for a period equal to the deficit
period, while a Title XVI facility that cannot show that it met the conditions of certification in the deficit period
must make up any remaining deficit whenever its certification is withdrawn. A facility with an unassessed deficit
may submit an independent certified audit to establish that no, or a lesser, deficit exists.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987, the Secretary again revised the 1979 regulations. 52 FR 46022 (Dec. 3, 1987). As pertinent here, an additional
compliance alternative for facilities with annual obligations of $10,000 or less was created. See &sect;124.514.
This alternative was adopted to bring the administrative costs of compliance for such facilities more into line with
the actual level of uncompensated services available, with the requirements applicable under &sect;124.514 resembling
those applicable under the public facility compliance alternative.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, the Secretary proposed an additional compliance alternative designed to address the compliance problems
of another class of facilities whose operational characteristics have created intractable compliance problems,
but which cannot qualify for the existing compliance alternatives. Many of these facilities provide substantial
amounts of free or below cost services, generally because they were created to provide services at no or a nominal charge
to all persons, or they serve an indigent population that is entirely covered by third-party programs such as Medicaid.
These facilities, which are generally private, nonprofit organizations, include facilities such as sheltered
workshops, crippled children rehabilitation facilities, cerebral palsy centers, chronic disease hospitals,
Goodwill Centers, facilities for the blind, mental health centers, and Easter Seal Centers. Based on experience
monitoring such facilities' compliance with the uncompensated services regulations since 1979, the Department
determined that many such facilities have accumulated large uncompensated services deficits, typically because
their policies of not charging or of serving populations covered under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governmental indigent care programs preclude receiving credit under the uncompensated services regulations for
the free and below cost care they in fact provide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department identified 180 private, nonprofit outpatient, rehabilitation, and community mental health center
facilities with outstanding uncompensated services obligations which were likely to have provided a large volume
of free or below cost care while receiving little or no uncompensated services credit. A survey of 28 of these confirmed
that there are a number of facilities for which compliance with the uncompensated services requirements is difficult
or impossible, given their charging policies, legal requirements applicable to their operations, characteristics
of their patient populations, or some combination of these factors, but which clearly provide health services without
regard to ability to pay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Secretary proposed to adopt a compliance alternative for private, nonprofit facilities which
provide a substantial amount of services without regard to ability to pay, but which find it difficult, if not impossible,
to comply with the present uncompensated services requirements. The proposed compliance alternative was substantially
similar to the public facility compliance alternative with respect to requirements for reporting, recordkeeping,
and the make-up of deficits. However, the eligibility criteria differed somewhat. Under the proposed rule, a facility
could qualify for the compliance alternative if it was a private, nonprofit entity falling into one of two categories:
either (1) it received no monies directly from patients with incomes up to twice the poverty level (exclusive of certain
deductible and coinsurance amounts and other required collections), or (2) it received for the three most recent
fiscal years at least 10 percent of its non-Medicaid and non-Medicare operating revenue from philanthropic sources
to cover operating deficits and either provided services under a ``program of discounted health services'' or provided
all services to all persons at no or a nominal charge (exclusive of certain deductible and coinsurance amounts and
other required collections). With respect to the first category, the NPRM stated that in the Department's view those
facilities that collect no monies from patients with incomes up to twice the poverty level are meeting the statute's
objectives. Similarly, with respect to the second category, the proposed percentage of private philanthropic support
was considered to be a proxy for tax support in the public facility context, as such monies are generally contributed
to fund services which are deemed essential or worthwhile, but which are not self-supporting. The ``program of discounted
health services'' criterion is analogous to a similar criterion in the public facility compliance alternative,
and reflects a recognition that many such facilities have in place a mechanism for determining eligibility for such
services by screening for ability to pay. The rationale for the other criterion is self-evident: Clearly, facilities
that provide all services at no or a nominal charge are adequately serving those in their patient population who are
unable to pay. The NPRM also solicited comment on whether the compliance alternative should be expanded to cover public
facilities that do not qualify for the public facility compliance alternative but whose operational characteristics
are similar to the private, nonprofit entities the alternative would cover.

The Department received 23 comments on the proposed rules, principally from rehabilitation and other facilities
and provider associations. While most of the comments received were in favor of the proposed compliance alternative
in principle, many suggested specific changes to the proposed policies. The comments and the Department's responses

a. Inclusion of Public Facilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters recommended that the criteria for certification be changed to permit the inclusion of public
facilities that otherwise meet the criteria for certification. They argued that there is operationally no difference
between such facilities and non-profit facilities that meet the criteria, and that it is unreasonable to penalize
public facilities just because they are public. The Department agrees with these comments and has changed the rules
accordingly, by eliminating proposed &sect;124.516(b)(1), which would have restricted the compliance alternative
to private, nonprofit facilities.

b. No Monies Received From the Indigent
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;124.516(b)(2) would have established, as one alternative criterion for certification, that a facility
received no monies directly from persons with incomes up to twice the poverty level, exclusive of amounts charged
or received for purposes of obtaining reimbursement under third party programs. Several commenters urged that this
criterion be revised to permit receipt of funds from such persons, on the grounds that it is unrealistic to expect a
facility to receive 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
no
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 money from such persons. It was suggested that the criterion be revised to permit receipt of funds up to some amount,
such as 10 percent of operating revenues. The Department has not accepted this suggestion. This criterion was intended
to accommodate those exceptional facilities which routinely provide all services at no charge to persons unable
to pay or which entirely serve populations ineligible for uncompensated services and are thus unable to comply with
the regulations. Facilities that collect monies from patients with incomes below twice the poverty level do not come
within the intent of this criterion. It should be noted, however, that such facilities may nonetheless be able to qualify
for the compliance alternative under a different criterion of the regulation, if they have a ``program of discounted
health services'' and receive the requisite amount of philanthropy. See &sect;124.516(b)(2) below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another suggestion made with respect to this criterion was that amounts collected from patients as part of their Medicaid
``spenddown'' be considered to be included under the exclusionary language of this section, so that collection of
such monies by a facility would not render it ineligible under this criterion. This suggestion has likewise not been
accepted. Spenddown amounts are clearly not within the scope of the exclusionary language as written, as Medicaid
eligibility does not exist until the patient has spent down the requisite amount, and therefore they are not amounts
charged that are reimbursable. Nor do we think the language should be revised to permit inclusion of spenddown amounts
in the amounts permitted to be charged or claimed. As stated above, this criterion is intended to cover a narrow class
of facilities_ones which can be considered to be meeting their Hill-Burton obligation because they are in fact not
receiving monies directly from any patients who would otherwise be eligible for Hill-Burton uncompensated services.
Permitting collection of spenddown amounts would thus not be consistent with the intended scope of this criterion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This criterion has been revised, however, to require that the facility demonstrate that it met the criterion for the
preceding three fiscal years. This revision brings this criterion into line with the 10 percent philanthropy criterion
of &sect;124.516(b)(2), which also requires a demonstration of compliance over the preceding three years. The purpose
of the three-year demonstration in both cases is to give the Secretary a basis for the conclusion that a facility applying
for certification in fact comes within the intended scope of the compliance alternative because of its characteristics
and problems, and that certification is not made based on what may be a one-time aberration in the facility's circumstances.
See &sect;124.516(b)(1) below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested that, in view of the difficulty many nursing homes have in finding individuals who are
eligible for uncompensated services and not also eligible for Medicaid, the Department create a new eligibility
category for persons in nursing homes with incomes up to four times the poverty level. In fact, the Secretary is considering
such a change to the regulations; an NPRM proposing to establish a new ``Category C,'' consisting of persons with incomes
up to three times the poverty level was recently published. 59 FR 15693 (April 4, 1994). It should be noted that, should
this latter policy subsequently be adopted, the Secretary would expect to revise &sect;124.516(b)(1) below to be
consistent with the revision in the underlying regulations.

c. Definition of ``Philanthropy''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the elimination of the restriction of the compliance alternative to private facilities, the Department
has also broadened the examples of ``philanthropy'' in the new &sect;124.516(b)(2)(i). As revised, the term ``philanthropy''
includes state and/or local funding, as it is anticipated that most philanthropic funding for public facilities
will originate from such sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``philanthropy'' has also been clarified by the addition of the phrase ``to cover operating deficits attributable
to the provision of discounted services.'' The added words, among other things, make clear that philanthropic state
or local funding within the scope of this section is different than state or local funds received under entitlement
programs, which have long been considered not to be ``uncompensated services''; see &sect;124.505(a). The additional
language imposes a similar restriction on other forms of philanthropy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the term ``philanthropy'' be further revised to include interest earned on donated
funds. However, since it is the Department's view that interest on donated funds is clearly from a ``philanthropic
source,'' further clarification of the regulation in this respect is not needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
d. Program of Discounted Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One provider group opposed the eligibility criterion permitting certification where a facility has a ``program
of discounted services.'' The group argued that this provision would create a problem under Medicaid and Medicare,
the rules of which prohibit those programs from subsidizing other patients. The Department does not believe that
this is a problem, since the discounts made to patients under a facility's discounted health services program are
not required to be reflected in charges to those programs. Certainly, this has not proved to be a problem with facilities
operating under the general compliance requirements or with facilities certified under the public facility compliance
alternative, which contains the same eligibility criterion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``program of discounted health services'' has been revised, however, by the addition of language
making clear that charges may be made under such a program for the purpose of obtaining third party reimbursements.
This policy was discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, but was omitted from the proposed rule itself. The change
simply makes the policy of this section consistent with the policy throughout the remainder of the subpart that third
party collections are to be encouraged. See &sect;124.505(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
e. No or Nominal Charge Policies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section has likewise been revised by the addition of the language discussed in the preceding paragraph. One comment
questioned the criterion set out in the proposed rules pertaining to making ``all services of the facility available
to all persons at no or a nominal charge.'' It expressed the concern that a hospital could qualify for the compliance
alternative under this criterion simply by designating some narrow group of services, then making them available
for free or at a nominal charge, while continuing to charge everyone fully for the facility's other services. We do
not share the commenter's concern, as the rule below expressly states that, in order to come within this criterion,
the facility must ``make[ ] all services of the facility available to all persons *&blank;*&blank;*'' See &sect;124.516(b)(2)(ii)(B)
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
f. Other Eligibility Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other proposals for eligibility criteria were received. Several commenters suggested that a facility's Medicaid
census be a basis for eligibility; these commenters suggested that facilities with a 70 percent or greater Medicaid
census be eligible for the compliance alternative. One commenter suggested that long-term care facilities with
characteristics ``similar'' to the proposed eligibility criteria likewise be considered to be eligible for the
compliance alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not persuaded that it should create a special eligibility criterion based on a facility's Medicaid/Medicare
census. Clearly, those facilities that serve large numbers of Medicaid or Medicare recipients are not precluded
from qualifying under one of the criteria below, if they in fact meet those criteria. Indeed, we do not think it would
be consistent with the theory underlying the compliance alternative to craft such an eligibility criterion. The
theory of the compliance alternative is that the facilities who come within it need the alternative because compliance
with the general compliance standards is difficult, if not impossible, for them because of their operational characteristics,
even though they are clearly providing free or below cost services to ``persons unable to pay.'' However, compliance
with the general compliance standards is not impossible for a facility with a 70 percent Medicaid/Medicare census
which charges the remaining 30 percent of its patient population. After all, if none of the remaining 30 percent of
the facility's patient population meets the eligibility criteria of &sect;124.505, the facility will qualify for
the compliance alternative under &sect;124.516(b)(1) below. Thus, it must be assumed that the intent of the proposed
revision would be to permit facilities to qualify for the compliance alternative even though they charge patients
who meet the Hill-Burton eligibility criteria and who thus could be provided uncompensated services.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the comment regarding long-term care facilities, the Department has not created a special criterion
for such facilities. If such facilities meet the eligibility criteria below, they may be certified under the new compliance
alternative. We note, moreover, that the proposed change in eligibility criteria for nursing homes may well relieve
some of the particular difficulties of nursing homes in complying with the general compliance standards.

2. Documentation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments expressed support for minimizing the reporting and recordkeeping required of qualifying facilities
under the proposed compliance alternative. One hospital, however, opposed the proposed rules on the grounds that
they simply created an additional layer of reporting and recordkeeping requirements, stating that the existing
requirements work well. It should be emphasized that the compliance alternative is not meant to create an additional
set of requirements for facilities already complying with the general compliance requirements at &sect;&sect;124.501&hyph;124.512;
rather, the compliance alternative below is designed to relieve facilities which qualify for it from the burden of
complying with the general compliance requirements. Consistent with this approach, the reporting and recordkeeping
required for qualifying facilities is different from that required of most facilities and should generally be considerably
less than that under the general compliance standards. In any event, a facility that is not certified under the compliance
alternative does not have to comply with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements applicable to those facilities
which are certified; concommitantly, a facility that is certified under the compliance alternative is not required
to comply with reporting and recordkeeping requirements other than those that apply to certified facilities. A facility
always has the option of continuing to comply with the general compliance requirements; it can thus ignore the compliance
alternative completely if it decides that compliance with the general compliance requirements makes more sense
for it. Thus, we do not think that this particular concern is justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A couple of commenters pointed out that the proposed means of demonstrating that a facility meets the eligibility
criteria_through audited financial statements_would not necessarily suffice, depending on the criterion involved.
They pointed out that, for example, audited financial statements do not necessarily set forth philanthropic sources
in the level of detail required, or establish a facility's charging policies. They suggested that the rule be amended
to require facilities to contract for such information as part of their audits. The Department agrees with the observation
made about the limitations of audited financial statements, but does not agree with the remedy proposed. Rather,
it is our view that documentation sufficient to establish sources of philanthropy, charging practices and so on can
be provided by other means, and we are reluctant to put facilities to the added expense of contracting for audit services
that they would not otherwise need. Thus, &sect;124.516(c)(1) below has been revised to add a requirement for ``other
documents'' to cover the concern raised by the commenters. The Department will issue program instructions clarifying
what other documents may be required in specific instances.

3. Deficits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that the proposed rules be revised to permit facilities to treat deficits resulting from
Medicaid underpayments as justifiable deficits. However, we are not accepting this comment, as it is not pertinent
to the compliance alternative. The rules below do not distinguish between types of deficits for purposes of deficit
make-up under the alternative, unlike the general compliance requirements, which do draw such a distinction. Compare
&sect;124.516(d)(2) below with &sect;124.503(b). Thus, under the compliance alternative, a certified facility
with a noncompliance deficit may make up the deficit in precisely the same manner as a certified facility with a justifiable
deficit.

4. Other Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments questioned whether vocational services could be counted as uncompensated services under the compliance
alternative; the facilities concerned stated that they have difficulty meeting the ACL since they do not receive
credit for vocational services they provide. The compliance alternative below should relieve this problem for facilities
that are certified, however. Certified facilities will not have to provide a set amount of uncompensated services,
unlike facilities operating under the general compliance requirements. Thus, so long as certified facilities provide
some medical services and otherwise remain in compliance with the requirements for certification, they will be considered
to be in compliance with their uncompensated services assurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the fact that the rules below relieve restrictions on facilities that apply and are certified for the compliance
alternative and impose no additional duties or obligations on other facilities, delay in the effective date of these
rules is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553. For the same reasons, the Secretary hereby finds that good cause exists for
not delaying the effective date of the rules below. The rules are accordingly effective upon publication.

Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule below would generally maintain the existing procedural and reporting requirements for the majority of obligated
facilities, but significantly lessen them for certain private, nonprofit or public facilities. The Department
has determined that the impact would not approach the annual $100 million threshold for major economic consequences
as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory impact analysis is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Secretary certifies that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule contains information collections which have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, and assigned control

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
0915&hyph;0171.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The underlying purpose of this rule is to decrease recordkeeping, reporting, and notification burden for the charitable
facilities. Facilities certified under the charitable facility compliance alternative will no longer be required
to maintain extensive records on uncompensated services (124.510(a)), but instead will have to maintain only records
which document its eligibility for the compliance alternative (124.510(b)). We believe this recordkeeping requirement
imposes no additional burden because these documents are ordinarily retained by facilities. This change is expected
to reduce the recordkeeping burden by 75 hours per facility per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, reporting burden will be reduced. Charitable facilities will be required to apply once for the certification
(124.516(c)), and thereafter will need only to certify their continued eligibility annually (124.509(b)). Currently,
facilities in deficit status, which include most of the charitable facilities, must file a report each year which
documents the amount of uncompensated care provided (124.509(a)). This change in reporting requirements is expected
to reduce the reporting burden by 6 hours per facility in the first year, and by 13.5 hours per facility in subsequent
years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, notification/disclosure burden will be eliminated, because the facilities will no longer be required
to: (1) Publish a notice each year of the availability of uncompensated services (124.504(a)); (2) provide individual
written notices to each person seeking service in the facility (124.504(c)); or (3) provide a determination of eligibility
to each person applying for uncompensated services (124.507). These changes are expected to reduce the notification
burden by 380 hours per facility per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All sections of the regulations that contain reporting, recordkeeping, or notification/disclosure requirements
have been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (OMB)

with an estimate of the annual reporting and recordkeeping burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the collection of information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of the requirement for ``other documents'' in &sect;124.516(c)(1) will not affect the burden because
the other documents are expected to be readily available materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimate of 150 applicants was based on a review, prior to development of the NPRM, of data on the kinds of facilities
expected to qualify for the alternative. A recent re-review of the list of facilities indicated that 30 of the facilities
have completed their obligations. With the addition of public facilities in the qualifying criteria, we expect approximately
30 additional facilities to apply for certification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A facility may qualify for certification under this section if it meets the criteria of either paragraph (b)(1) or
paragraph (b)(2) of this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It received, for the three most recent fiscal years, no monies directly from patients with incomes up to double
the current poverty line issued by the Secretary pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902, exclusive of amounts charged or received
for purposes of claiming reimbursement under third party insurance or governmental programs, such as Medicaid or
Medicare deductible or coinsurance amounts; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) It received, for the three most recent fiscal years, at least 10 percent of its total operating revenue (net
patient revenue plus other operating revenue, exclusive of any amounts received, or if not received, claimed, as
reimbursement under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act) from philanthropic sources to cover operating
deficits attributable to the provision of discounted services. Philanthropic sources include private trusts,

for financial and other objective eligibility criteria and procedures, including notice prior to nonemergency
service, that assure effective opportunity for all persons to apply for and obtain a determination of eligibility
for such services including a determination prior to service where requested; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission's 1994 User Fee Update is adopted substantially as proposed in our notice of proposed rulemaking published
at 59 FR 29586 (June 8, 1994). However, due to recent Congressional action concerning tariff filings and the delay
in implementing optical imaging for tariff filings, Fee Item (74)(i) relating to the filing of tariffs, rates schedules,
and contract and/or contract summaries including supplements, is set at $13 rather that $15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, the description of Fee Item (85) involving valuation of railroad lines in conjunction with purchase offers
is being revised to clarify that the fee applies to offers to subsidize a rail line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission concludes that the fee changes adopted here will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities because the Commission's regulations provide for waiver of filing fees for those entities
which can make the required showing of financial hardship. In addition, the fee policy changes adopted here will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because those changes only involve minor
revisions of the Commission's user fee policy.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS rescinds the closure of the fishery for large coastal sharks conducted in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and
Caribbean Sea. Rescission of the closure of this fishery is necessary because new information indicates that the
second semiannual quota for large coastal sharks has not been taken. Based on revised estimates of landings and projected
catches, a new closure date is established.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Atlantic shark fishery is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP)
for Atlantic Sharks under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
.). Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR part 678.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 678.23(b)(3) of the regulations provides for two semiannual quotas of large coastal sharks to be harvested
in or from the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, by owners or operators
of vessels permitted under &sect;678.4. The adjusted second semiannual quota of 1,318 metric tons (mt) is available
for harvest from July 1 through December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), is required under &sect;678.24 to monitor the catch and landing
statistics and, on the basis of these statistics, to determine when the catch of sharks in or from the Western North
Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, will equal any quota under &sect;678.23(b). When
shark harvests reach, or are projected to reach, a quota established under &sect;678.23(b), the AA is further required
under &sect;678.24 to close the fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AA had determined, based on the best available data on reported catch and projections of future landings, that
the semiannual quota for large coastal sharks in or from the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico
and Caribbean Sea, for the period July 1 through December 31, 1994, would be attained by August 10, 1994. Therefore,
a closure notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 1, 1994 (59 FR 38943), to take effect August 10, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon further analysis of the landings data, including new information that became available since announcement
of the closure date, the AA has determined that 656.95 mt of the 1,318 mt quota for the large coastal shark fishery remain
unharvested. Therefore, the closure of August 10, 1994, is rescinded effective September 1, to allow an opportunity
for shark fishermen to take their full allocation. The effective date of rescission has been established at September
1, 1994, in response to industry's request for sufficient advance notice of the reopening of the large coastal shark
fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The daily landing rates obtained from the revised estimates indicate that the remaining quota in the large coastal
shark fishery could be harvested within 40 days. Therefore, it is projected that the available quota will be taken
by October 10, 1994, and for vessels issued a permit under &sect;678.4, possession of large coastal sharks from the
management unit will be prohibited as of 0001 hours on October 11, 1994. The AA is announcing this closure date in advance
in response to industry's request for sufficient advance notice of the closure of the large coastal shark fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the closure, for vessels issued a permit under &sect;678.4, possession of large coastal sharks from the management
unit is prohibited, unless the vessel is operating as a charter vessel or headboat, in which case the vessel limit per
trip is four large coastal sharks. However, the sale, purchase, trade, or barter or attempted sale, purchase, trade,
or barter of carcasses and/or fins of large coastal sharks harvested by a person aboard a vessel that has been issued
a permit under &sect;678.4 is prohibited, except for those that were harvested, off-loaded, and sold, traded, or
bartered prior to October 10, 1994, and were held in storage by a dealer or processor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 14 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437l) (``the Act''), as amended by section 119 of the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (the ``1987 Act'') and Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing
Act of 1990 (``NAHA''), established the Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP), which was designed to govern the modernization
needs of PHAs and IHAs that own and operate 250 or more public or Indian housing units. PHAs and IHAs that own and operate
fewer than 250 public or Indian housing units are governed by the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(The reader should note that, hereafter, for ease of discussion, the preamble to this final rule uses the terms ``public
housing'' to refer to both public and Indian housing, and ``HAs'' or ``housing agency,'' to refer to both PHAs and IHAs,
unless otherwise stated. In addition, the term ``development'' is used to refer to ``low-income projects,'' as defined
at section 3(b)(l) of the Act.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department promulgated regulations for the CGP and CIAP at 24 CFR parts 905 and 968, and these regulations have
governed the modernization of public and Indian housing assisted under the Act. On February 14, 1992, the Department
published the final rule for the CGP at 57 FR 5514. The February 14, 1992 rule amended the CIAP at 24 CFR part 968, subpart
B, to limit its applicability to HAs that own or operate fewer than 500 public housing units (fewer than 250 units beginning
in Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 1993); added a new subpart C to part 968, which sets forth the new CGP for HAs that own or operate
a total of 500 or more public housing units (250 or more units beginning in FFY 1993); and revised both the CIAP and CGP
programs for purposes of implementing various technical and substantive program amendments contained in sections
509 (b) through (f) of the NAHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 15, 1993, the Department published an interim rule for CIAP at 58 FR 13916 for HAs with less than 250 units in
FFY 1993 and minor technical corrections for CGP. The CIAP interim rule was published in response to public comment
requesting both streamlining and simplification and was also based on experience gained through program operation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 8, 1994, the Department published a proposed CGP rule for comment at 59 FR 10876 (hereinafter referred to as
the ``proposed rule''). The proposed rule requested comments on HUD's efforts to simplify and expedite the CGP planning
and funding process for HAs that own or operate 250 or more public or Indian housing units. HUD also requested comments
on other aspects affecting the operation of the CGP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD received 35 comments in response to the proposed rule for CGP. Comments were received from 23 PHAs, 5 IHAs, one individual
and 6 interest groups including Public Housing Authorities Directors Association (PHADA), National Association
of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO), Council of Large Public Housing Authorities (CLPHA), National
American Indian Housing Council (NAIHC), Association of Community Organization for Reform Now (ACORN), and Pacific
Southwest Region Development and Modernization Coordinators (PSRDMC). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments were overwhelmingly positive and were supportive of HUD's efforts to simplify and expedite the CGP.
Commenters were pleased that HUD had minimized the regulation and provided HAs with more flexibility. The aspects
of this rule which generated the most comment were the proposed full fungibility of work items over a five-year period
and eligible costs, especially management improvements and administrative costs. This summary will outline the
comments with HUD's response in the regulation order. Comments on the public housing regulation (Part 968) and Indian
housing regulation (Part 905) have been combined except where there are differences in the provisions for public
and Indian housing. Miscellaneous comments and responses will follow the comments on the regulations.

Set-Aside for Emergencies and Disasters

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters responded to the proposed change in paragraph (b) of &sect;&sect;905.601 and 968.103 which would
allow all HAs (including smaller HAs that participate in CIAP) to apply for emergency and disaster funds from the $75
million set-aside. Both commenters were supportive of this change which provides another avenue for smaller agencies
to access urgently needed resources; however, one of the commenters did not support the maintenance of the set-aside
out of modernization funds and suggested other fund sources such as National Emergency Relief funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 14 of the Act authorizes this set-aside from modernization funds. The set-aside is part of the formula approach
and makes up for funding shortfalls to address emergencies or disasters. This provision would also allow CIAP HAs
to receive funding for unanticipated emergencies during the period between when CIAP funds are exhausted for the
current year and when funds are available for next year, as well as for disasters at any time during the year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements governing the reserve for disasters and emergencies and the procedures by which an HA may request
such funds are found at &sect;&sect;905.667 (IHAs) and 968.312 (PHAs). HAs (including a PHA that has been designated
as mod troubled under PHMAP or IHAs that are determined to be high risk under &sect;905.135) may obtain funds at any
time, for any eligible emergency work item as defined in &sect;&sect;905.102 or 968.305 (for HAs participating in
CGP, ``CGP HAs'') or for any eligible emergency work item (described as emergency modernization in &sect;&sect;905.102
or 968.205) (for HAs participating in CIAP, ``CIAP HAs''), from the reserve established under &sect;&sect;905.601(b)
or 968.103(b). However, emergency reserve funds may not be provided to a CGP HA that has the necessary funds available
from any other source, including its annual formula allocation under &sect;&sect;905.601 (e) and (f) or 968.103
(e) and (f), other unobligated modernization funds, and its replacement reserves under &sect;&sect;905.666 or
968.310(a)(3). A CGP HA is not required to have an approved comprehensive plan under &sect;&sect;905.672 or 968.320
before it can request emergency assistance from this reserve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emergency reserve funds may not be provided to a CIAP HA that has the necessary funds available from any other source,
including unobligated CIAP, or if CIAP funding is available. A CIAP HA will not be required to repay emergency funds,
because it does not have a future formula allocation of assistance with which to make this repayment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, the set-aside has never been depleted in any of the FFYs of CGP operation. This final rule adopts the proposed
rule's provisions. However, the Department is seeking legislation which will permit the set-aside to be used for
other purposes including activities related to the settlement of litigation and desegregation of public housing.

 HUD has retained the proposed rule's provisions on calculation of number of units. In order to treat each HA fairly,
HUD will count units that have reached date of full availability (DOFA) and are under ACC amendment by the first day
in the FFY in which the formula is being run.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All of the IHAs which commented provided suggestions on the treatment of paid-off units. Two commenters were in favor
of modernizing paid-off units only if additional funds are made available (paid-off units being included in the calculation
of units under management for formula funding allocation purposes).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Units which are paid-off, but not conveyed, are included in the calculation of units under management and for purposes
of determining the IHA's formula share until they are conveyed. Upon conveyance, units are removed from the count
of units under management and thereafter are no longer counted in the formula funding calculation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An IHA wanted to be able to work on homes that have been paid-off if the family that paid-off the home is still in possession
of the home, or to work on any home that pays off after submission of the five-year plan, and recommended that paid-off
units should be added to the unit count. One IHA suggested grandfathering all units that were originally submitted
in the five-year plan but have subsequently been paid-off. Another IHA indicated that some Mutual Help participants
are being penalized by the cut-off date, and IHAs should be allowed to work on their homes even if they are paid-off when
the individual has fulfilled all of their obligations by not being delinquent (or who makes the maximum house payments)
and still occupies the home.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has decided to remove the regulatory prohibition against modernizing Mutual Help units which are
paid-off but not conveyed. The Department believes that the only regulatory restrictions on the modernization of
paid-off Mutual Help units should be that: title has not been conveyed to the homebuyer; where the homebuyer has a delinquency
at the end of the amortization period, non-emergency modernization work shall not be done until all delinquencies
are repaid; and, the units shall be identified in the Comprehensive Plan (including the Physical Needs Assessments
and Five-Year Action Plan). The prohibition against performing modernization work on conveyed units is based on
a determination by the Department's Office of General Counsel that statutory authority for the expenditure of modernization
funds is limited to existing public housing units. Once title is conveyed and the unit is no longer covered by the ACC,
the unit is no longer a public housing unit and there is no legal authority for the expenditure of modernization funds
provided under section 14 of the Act. IHAs that wish to modernize conveyed Mutual Help units must obtain funding from
another source; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 proceeds from the sale of homeownership units or Bureau of Indian Affairs Housing Improvement Program funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the recommendations provided by the commenters concerning whether the unit must be occupied by the
homebuyer that paid it off, the Department believes that prior to conveyance, the unit would be occupied by an eligible
subsequent homebuyer and therefore the unit itself would be eligible for modernization work, where needed. The Department
believes that decisions as to whether the IHA plans to modernize paid-off but not conveyed Mutual Help units at all,
which specific units will be modernized and the level of work to be provided, should be made at the local level by the
IHA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also has removed restrictions on the modernization of paid-off but not conveyed Turnkey III units
to the extent that there is statutory authority to do so. The authority to perform comprehensive modernization on
Mutual Help units provided by the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 does not extend to Turnkey III units. Because
the eligibility of homeowner-occupied Turnkey III units for modernization work is limited, see &sect;905.666 and
&sect;968.310, the regulations have been amended to allow HAs to do work necessary to meet statutory or regulatory
requirements in Turnkey III units which are paid-off, so long as the work is completed prior to conveyance.

Contingency Accounts

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although not proposed by HUD, three commenters recommended an HA-wide line-item account for contingencies. Such
an account could be used for cost overruns and contract modifications (change orders). The commenters called for
money assigned to this account by the HA to be considered ``obligated''. One PHA has found that its underruns on construction
contracts are sufficient to fund most exigencies and act as a de facto contingency account. However, HUD restricts
the use of underruns by requiring that all monies be reprogrammed within the funding program's original obligation
period. It was noted that a contingency line item exists for development funds, and the amount in the contingency line
item could be limited to a fixed percentage of the construction costs and would not require HAs to make numerous revisions
to their budgets. A single revision could be made annually with the contract modifications reflected in the proper
line item.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD generally agrees with these comments and has revised the regulation to permit HAs to budget for a contingency account
for cost overruns and contract modifications. HUD notes that Section 504 accessibility conversion is an eligible
expense under HA-wide physical improvements. Refer to the next section below for a discussion of HA-wide items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD currently permits a contingency account in its Development Program and has decided to adopt a similar approach
for the CGP. A HA may budget up to 8% of its total annual grant for a contingency account. (A new account will be established
and included on the Annual Statement Form). Money budgeted in a contingency account is considered unobligated until
it is moved to another account and obligated for a cost overrun or other work items. The HA will provide the status of
its contingency account in its annual Performance and Evaluation Report (P&amp;E Report). For example, if an HA uses
$100,000 from its contingency fund for a contract modification in Account 1460, the P&amp;E Report will reflect a
reduction of $100,000 in the contingency account and an increase of $100,000 in Account 1460. The $100,000 will be
obligated when the contract modification is issued under Account 1460. The contingency account will be a fixed account
for each annual grant; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the HA cannot replenish the account as funds are used from it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD wishes to clarify that it does not restrict the use of underruns by requiring that all monies be reprogrammed within
the funding program's original obligation period. Under the CGP, a HA may extend the target dates for fund obligation
in the approved Annual Statement without prior HUD approval whenever any delay outside of the HA's control occurs,
as specified by HUD (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 litigation, HUD or other institutional delay, extended labor strikes, extended material shortages, or need to use
leftover funds) and the extension is made in a timely manner. The need to reprogram unobligated funds resulting from
underruns constitutes a valid reason for self-executing a time extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One HA suggested a two pronged approach for implementing contingency accounts. First, HUD should remove the two-year
obligation deadline and allow HAs to obligate monies at any time in the modernization process provided that the funds
are expended within the 5-year statutory limit. The second component would permit each HA to establish a line-item
contingency account equal to 1%&hyph;2% of the total grant amount in its annual submission. Funds resulting from
underruns or credit contract modifications would be transferred into the contingency account for future use. The
account would not be allowed to exceed 10% of the outstanding grant balance without prior HUD approval. HAs would draw
funds to pay for contingencies from the account as needed. These funds would be added to contract accounts via budget
modifications. In general, excess contingency account funds would be reprogrammed into additional modernization
work. This modernization work could come from anywhere in the HA's physical or management needs assessment or from
eligible management improvements. As the expenditure deadline for a particular funding year nears, HAs would begin
to use the excess funds in that year's contingency account to pay for contract work performed in other funding programs.
At the end of the fifth year, all program funds_including contingency account funds_would be expended. HAs would
prepare for HUD's review and audit, annual reports detailing the use of all contingency funds. In addition, program
close-out reports would provide HUD with a detailed accounting for each contract on which program funds were spent.
An amendment to &sect;&sect;905.666 and 968.310 was also recommended to describe the mechanics for operating a contingency
account.

 HUD wishes to clarify that there is no statutory two-year obligation period, three-year expenditure period, or 5-year
statutory limit for spending funds approved in a particular FFY. However, HUD expects that funds allocated in a FFY,
including those designated by the HA as contingency funds, will be obligated within two years and expended within
three years of approval. If an HA can demonstrate that a longer implementation schedule is necessary (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 size of grant, complexity of work), HUD may approve an obligation/expenditure schedule that exceeds this National
guideline. The HA has responsibility for proposing its implementation schedule, as part of each Annual Work Statement.
Also, as previously noted, the HA may self-execute a time extension of the approved implementation schedule for reasons
outside of its control (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 litigation). In all cases, however, timeliness of obligation and expenditure of funds will be considered in the assessment
of a PHA's modernization performance under the PHMAP.

The HA may initially budget up to 8% of its annual grant for contingencies, and HUD believes that this provides sufficient
flexibility for HAs within each annual grant. When the HA needs to use the funds in this contingency account for cost
overruns or other work within its Five-Year Action Plan, the HA is required to ``move the funds'' through internal
budgeting to other eligible development accounts and then draw down the funds from other line items. After the HA has
moved the funds from the contingency account into other eligible development accounts for purposes of obligation
and expenditure, the HA may not replenish this account because at program completion, this account must be zero. Therefore,
HUD has not adopted the suggestion that funds resulting from underruns or contract modifications be used to replenish
this account since funds in the contingency account must be moved to other line items for drawdown in a timely fashion
to meet the HA's approved implementation schedule. Funds resulting from underruns or credit contract modifications,
as well as funds not needed for contingencies shall be reprogrammed for other modernization work in the approved Five-Year
Action Plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters recommended a HA-wide line item account for relocation services, asbestos testing and abatement,
lead-based paint abatement and ``on demand'' Section 504 accessibility conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD recognizes that HAs occasionally encounter work items that are unpredictable, such as lead-based paint abatement
when a child has been identified as having an elevated blood level or the need to modify a unit for physical accessibility.
Therefore, HUD wishes to clarify that HA-wide line item accounts covering HA-wide activities such as lead-based
paint, Section 504 compliance, mitigation of environmental hazards such as asbestos abatement, and modernization
of vacant units is consistent with established program requirements and procedures and does not require any change
to the existing regulation. Note: modernization of vacant units is limited to non-routine maintenance work items.
Routine maintenance is not an eligible modernization cost. Funds budgeted in a HA-wide line item should be based on
historical data. The HA should estimate the amount of funds that it anticipates will be needed, annually, on the above
items. The HA-wide line item would enable the HA to complete these work items at any of its developments, and avoid numerous
budget revisions because the estimated needs at a particular development are under-funded or over-funded. However,
the HA is required to report in the Performance and Evaluation Report on the quantity and cost for each development
where HA-wide activities were carried out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to HA-wide line items, a HA may wish to consider utilizing an indefinite quantity architectural/engineering
(A/E) contract to meet its needs with regard to the above types of work. HAs usually hire A/E firms to provide services
as specific needs arise. Many HAs, however, have the need for a number of A/E services during the course of the next one
or two years. In these cases, the HA may solicit for an indefinite quantity contract where separate orders are issued
to the selected A/E firm for each service as the need arises. Another method similar to this approach is to issue a solicitation
for several A/E firms to provide services on an as-required basis rather than merely one firm. The solicitation would
clearly indicate that the HA anticipates having the need for several A/E services, identify types of services to be
provided for that year, and describe how an A/E firm would be selected among the groups. As the need arises, the HA would
execute contracts with A/E firms for specific tasks in accordance with the procedures identified in the solicitation.
These methods allow the HA to quickly contract for critical services in a timely manner rather than waiting until the
need arises to issue the solicitation and select the needed firm. Further information regarding indefinite quantity
contracts for A/E services is found in paragraph 4&hyph;26 of the Procurement Handbook.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Twenty-eight comments were received on the proposal to raise the cap on management improvements from 10% to 20% and
to permit high performers under PHMAP or IHAs determined by the Field Office to be high performing and with administrative
capacity to exceed the 20% limit. To the maximum extent feasible, the Department proposed that HAs should use management
improvement funds to train residents in carrying out activities related to the modernization-funded physical and
management improvements. Most commenters saw the proposal as a significant improvement. Some noted that this proposal
will not relieve HUD of its responsibility to adequately fund mandates regarding resident services (security improvements,
training, etc.) and operating subsidies. Others opposed the Department for even suggesting that modernization
improvement funds be utilized for resident training activities and preferred that this be left to local discretion.
Many commenters urged a return to ``true'' management improvement activities, rather than recent years' necessity
of funding on-going operational need in HAs in areas of security, drug prevention and enforcement and resident services.
It was recommended that CGP funds should only be used for incremental improvement to equipment and information systems,
but not personnel. It was noted that each HA's modernization grant is based upon a formula allocation, which is based
upon that HA's estimated modernization needs. There is nothing in this method of allocation which reflects or is based
upon a HA's needs for funding for security, resident services, or resident initiatives programs, nor is the formula
allocation process designed to address those needs. Other commenters saw the percentage limitation increase enabling
some HAs to address new and greater problems dealing with crime and security as well as family values. One commenter
supported the proposal because it could result in needed funds for resident training required for compliance with
Section 3 and other programs such as the Family Investment Center Program and Youthbuild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended that HUD should also broaden the list of allowable management improvements, especially
to include the establishment of preventive maintenance systems as an eligible item under management improvements,
perhaps up to a certain reasonable percentage limit (one recommended 6% of most HA's CGP grants). CLPHA and NAHRO strongly
recommended that management improvement rules allow preventive maintenance to be funded. They recommended where
a low AEL has resulted in seriously declining housing stock with high levels of deferred maintenance, the first few
years of implementing a Preventive Maintenance Program represent a major non-recurring expense in terms of both
manpower and materials. After the first three years, the cost associated with this program was proposed by some commenters
to be reduced to a level that is supportable within the normal operating budget.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD would like to clarify by explicitly adding the example to the regulation that the establishment of a preventive
maintenance system or improvement of an existing system is already an eligible management improvement. The Department
strongly encourages HAs to establish a preventive maintenance system or improve an existing system to assure that
the modernization-funded physical improvements are sustained. A preventive maintenance system must provide for
regular inspections of building structures, systems and units and determine the applicability of work eligible
for operating funds (routine maintenance) and work eligible for CGP funding (non-routine maintenance).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters opposed the increase to 20% because of their belief that the majority of modernization funds should
go to property improvement. They asserted that the CGP was becoming another HUD social program and stated there were
wastes in the area of management improvements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters requested that the Department reconsider and give the proposed incentive to all standard and high
performing HAs. It was also recommended that subparagraph (f)(1)(iii) should clarify that there is an exception
to the 20% threshold by a cross-reference to (m)(1). Clarification was requested whether a HA must be an over-all high
performer, mod-high performer, both or either.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to the comments, HUD has decided to increase the cap on management improvements from 10% to 20% for all HAs
and to completely remove the cap for PHAs designated as both over-all high performers and mod-high performers under
the PHMAP. HUD does not agree that increasing the allowable management improvement limit moves the CGP towards becoming
another ``HUD social program''. Many management improvements are geared towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness
of a HA's operations and are necessary to sustain the physical improvements. It should be noted that the direct delivery
of social services is an ineligible CGP expenditure. Experience has shown that physical improvements without appropriate
management actions often are not sustained, thereby wasting federal dollars. HUD will continue to strongly suggest
that HAs use management improvement funds for resident training and has retained this suggestion in &sect;968.310(m)(1).

 One IHA commented that there is no equality as to how ACA reviews are conducted at the HUD level since some reviews are
not conducted on site, leading to determinations which may not be accurate. Two IHAs suggested that the criteria for
IHA high performers should be stringent enough that only the best managed IHAs be classified as high performers, and
that all areas of IHA management and operations should be evaluated. They suggested the following criteria: (a) The
IHA must have a final ACA score of 90% or above for two consecutive years, including the FFY that funds are being requested,
and (b) the IHA must be current on all implementation schedules for action CGP and CIAP grants. Two commenters suggested
that HUD consult with interested parties to set guidelines for high performers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD does not agree with the suggestions that ACA scores be used to determine whether an IHA qualifies as a high performer.
The ACA is to be used to highlight areas where training or technical assistance may be needed, identify IHAs with potential
problems, and determine functional areas where reviews are needed. HUD has decided to delay implementation of the
incentive for high performing IHAs in order to maximize the opportunity for consultation with interested parties.
HUD will invite public comment on the criteria to be used to determine high performers when the revised Indian Housing
regulations at 24 CFR part 905 are published as a proposed rule.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD limited HAs to no more than 7% of their annual grant for administrative costs in account 1410, excluding any costs
related to in-house lead-based paint or asbestos testing, in-house A/E work, or other special administrative costs
required by State, Tribal or local law, unless specifically approved by HUD. An additional 2% of the annual grant may
be spent on costs related to travelling to the HA's developments for CGP-related business, as specifically approved
by HUD. Eighteen comments were received on this provision. Most of the comments urged HUD to raise the cap to 10%. Most
found the current 7% to be insufficient to fully administer the modernization program. For example, one commenter
indicated that in a high cost area, the expenses for a construction manager and clerk of the works, with benefits, exceed
the 7% cap. HUD was advised that even HAs which operate in a limited geographical area often require overnight travel
and pay a premium for administration because of the need to operate over several telephone area codes. HAs which have
highly active, very organized Resident Advisory Councils and Resident Management Corporations have higher administrative
costs because of increased level of outreach, planning, consultations and discussions. Similarly, HAs that operate
joint ventures with residents also experience increase administrative costs. Others noted that the present 7% cap
does not reflect the spiraling increase in health benefits, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance premiums
for administrative workers, increase in complexity and resulting staff time to comply with HUD's regulations, and
increase in expenses associated with transitioning from the CIAP model to CGP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters recommended that the word ``in-house'' be deleted, and that any costs related to lead-based paint or asbestos
testing be excluded from the 7% total. Another commenter emphasized the administrative burden that lead-based paint
and asbestos abatement imposes on HAs. Nearly every rehabilitation and remodeling activity in public housing developments
now requires the work of environmental consultants for lead-based paint and/or asbestos testing and abatement.
The oversight and administration of these contracts is very time- and resource-intensive. Some commenters requested
examples of areas where the Field Offices could approve higher limits. HUD was asked to clarify the issue of administration
of force-account labor. It was requested that the regulation state that administrative costs associated with force
account labor used in relationship to resident training programs are eligible management improvement costs. NAIHC
noted that IHAs with force account labor incur additional administrative costs because they need more warehouse
space to house their materials, more administrative staff to process the paperwork, and more financial management
staff to assure records are up-to-date. In addition, development staff spends more time overseeing the entire program.
They recommended that the administrative cost limit be set at 10%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that like management improvements, standard and high performing HAs be allowed to exceed
the 7% level without prior HUD approval. Retaining the additional 2% for CGP travel-related expenses received approval,
but it was recommended that it should not be limited to commercial vendors because some legitimate overnight travel
may be conducted by private or PHA-owned automobiles. Some commenters suggested that the additional 2% should include
some factor related to miles traveled in relationship to density of developments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The comments clearly demonstrate a need for an increase in the administrative cost limit. Accordingly, HUD has raised
the administrative cost limit to 10% for all HAs. Field Offices may approve amounts higher than the 10% limit where
there is sufficient justification to warrant an increase. Because of the increase in the overall administrative
cost limit, HUD has deleted the additional 2% limit related to travel costs. It should be noted that costs related to
lead-based paint or asbestos testing (whether conducted by force account employees or by a contractor) are excluded
from the 10% administrative cost total. In response to the request for clarification on the issue of administration
of force-account labor, it should be noted that non-technical oversight costs associated with force account work
are included in the cost limitations for administrative costs (account 1410). The actual force account labor costs
including direct supervision are charged to the appropriate account for the work being performed,

 Recently, the Public Housing Development Program, revised its cost containment and modest design requirements
to provide HAs with maximum flexibility regarding work items previously considered amenities. Maximum flexibility
is hereby being provided in the CGP. The Department has modified its policy regarding eligible work items under CGP
to allow work items that are modest in design and cost, but still blend in with the design and architecture of the surrounding
communities by including amenities, quality materials and design and landscaping features that are customary for
the locality. The Indian Housing Development Program also encourages IHAs to incorporate culturally relevant design
concepts into their developments. For guidance in culturally relevant design considerations, IHAs may refer to

It should be noted that there will be no increase in operating subsidy due to items added to promote the blend of public
housing into the surrounding neighborhood. Such items may be included in the modernization of a development as long
as the provisions for cost reasonableness are met. The PHA/IHA Board Resolution approving the Comprehensive Plan/Annual
Statement, Form HUD&hyph;52836, will be modified to include a certification that the modernization work will promote
Public and Indian housing that is modest in design and cost, but still blends in with the surrounding community.

 Purchase of maintenance vehicles that are necessary to administer/implement the modernization program are eligible

Program and other programs administered by the HA, the cost of the purchase shall be prorated among programs. By statute,
CGP funds are to be used to improve the physical condition of existing public housing projects and to upgrade the management
and operation of such projects. All work items, including the purchase of equipment, must be directly related to carrying
out the physical and management improvements to HA property.

 Most found that the previous system caused unnecessary confusion and created HA credibility issues with residents
and local government. They agreed with HUD's proposal to eliminate the presumptive estimates since, in general,
they no longer serve a useful purpose. This change eliminates the burden of amending the Five-Year Action Plan and/or

 HAs expressed a need to receive their final formula amounts at the earliest possible date. This would allow HAs to base
proposed work items and budgets on the actual dollars available. Commenters also requested HUD to update the formula
characteristics data in July and August of each year so that the formula characteristics information can be finalized
in September. If the formula characteristics information was ready in September, it could be applied at the earliest
possible date to the congressionally appropriated amount yielding each HA its final funding amount significantly
ahead of the March 1994 date achieved this year. Access to new CGP funds at the earliest possible date is critical to
obligating and expending CGP funds in a timely manner.

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD will transmit the formula characteristics data to HAs before the end of the current FFY for review and updating
for the next year's formula run. However, since the formula calculation is based on all units that are under ACC and
have reached DOFA by October 1 of the FFY in which the formula is being run, it is not feasible for HAs to return the FCR
until after October 1. Notwithstanding an early review and correction of data, HAs should be aware that the exact amount
of funds available for the CGP may not be known until several months into the FFY. This is due to the need to determine
the following: (1) Amount of funds, if any, carried over from the previous FFY; (2) amount of funds authorized for set-asides
by the Appropriations Act; and (3) shortfalls, if any, in other programs which share the Annual Contributions Account
with the Modernization Program. Once the adjusted total appropriation for the Modernization Program is determined,
then the Department is able to run the modernization formula, which determines the allocation of funds between the
CIAP and CGP, as well as the formula amounts for CGP HAs. However, HUD still anticipates that HAs will have access to
their formula amounts earlier in the FFY since only one formula amount will be provided.

by HUD to determine if they have a valid basis for appeal. Currently, HUD issues virtually no information on how the
amounts are calculated from year to year, other than the formula characteristics which HUD uses as input to the formula.
Commenters requested that HUD provide a simplified explanation to all HAs, including such factors as any set-asides
HUD is making each year off the top of the modernization, the R.S. Means or other factors HUD is using to adjust local
allocation levels, and any deductions HUD is making against the HA's allocation.

 HUD intends to prepare a Notice each FFY that explains any modernization set-asides, deductions and carry-over funds
and the amount of funds allocated to the CIAP and the CGP. HUD will also provide information relative to the R.S. Means
Index used for that FFY. The formula characteristics data used to calculate the formula amount will be transmitted
to the HA with its formula amount.

 HUD gives HAs 30 days to review and advise HUD of errors in the FCR. It does not specify the calculation of the 30 days.
It is recommended that the regulation be redrafted to state ``30 days from the HA's receipt to review and advise HUD
of errors'' because of previous delays (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., up to 15 days before HAs received this year's report). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the appeal of a HA's annual formula allocation can only be based on unique circumstances. HAs suggest that
this is inappropriate and should be changed, but they realized that this would require a statutory amendment. HAs
want to be able to appeal their allocation if it is based on calculations that inaccurately represent a HA's real modernization
needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was also noted that the increase in the amount of time a HA has to appeal based upon error from 30 to 60 days equalizes
the HUD&hyph;HA partnership for appeals based both on error and unique circumstances. However, if HAs do not file
within the time period, they forfeit their appeal rights. In the spirit of true partnership, it was suggested that
if HUD fails to respond to an appeal in either situation within 60 days, HUD should forfeit its right to reject the appeal.
Further, they stated that this would only be effective and fair if HUD officials do not automatically disapprove an
appeal in order to extend the time period.

 HUD acknowledges past difficulty in ensuring that HAs had a full 30 days to review and return the FCR. It would be difficult
to track a HA's receipt of the FCR on an individual basis, and there is a need for a fixed time for HAs to respond. Because
the data changes little on an annual basis, HA review time should be minimal. As previously noted, HUD will send out
the FCR prior to the end of the FFY, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mid-August), and HA responses will not be due until after October 1. In addition, HUD has revised the regulation to
provide that the HA will have at least 30 days to review and correct errors in the FCR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the commenters recognized that a statutory amendment would be necessary to allow other bases for appeals
of the annual formula allocation, HUD would like to point out that the formula is based on data collected from a major
study of the modernization needs of public and Indian housing agencies. This formula is being used because the modernization
needs study could not provide statistically valid data on modernization needs for every HA. The formula by its nature
cannot be completely accurate in estimating the needs at each HA participating in the CGP, but does provide for a reliable
source of funds to all participating HAs. HAs should also recognize that, because this formula funds on the basis of
relative needs of HAs, a successful appeal by one HA results in the reduction of formula allocations to all other HAs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAs are also advised that the appeals no longer have an extra layer of HUD review. The review and approval of appeals
on the basis of error in data and of the reduced formula because a PHA is mod-troubled have been delegated to the Field
Offices, and this should facilitate HUD's responding to those appeals within the 60-day time frame. The approval
of appeals on the basis of unique circumstances will be approved at the Headquarter's level following review at the
Field Office level. The review at the Regional Office level has been eliminated. Therefore, HUD has not adopted the
suggestion that an appeal is considered approved if HUD does not approve/disapprove within 60 days.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter noted that HUD should be more aggressive in recapturing CGP and CIAP funding which has not been obligated
or expended in a timely manner and should also be more aggressive about reallocating CGP funding withheld from mod-troubled
HAs. It was urged that these funds should be reallocated in a timely fashion to HAs who have proven that they can obligate
and expend the funds in a timely fashion. Commenters were concerned that FFY 1995 CGP funding would be reduced for all
HAs because of the amount of unobligated and unexpended funds. Instead, they suggested that HUD add recaptured and
reallocated funds to new congressional appropriations to put the money where it will get utilized. HAs indicated
that it was unfair to penalize high performing HAs because some HAs have been negligent in obligating and expending
their funds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The commenter should note that section 14 of the Act, as amended, provides the methodology and eligibility for the
reallocation of funds. The Act also establishes a credit system to provide a HA with additional funding after the HA
is determined to be no longer mod-troubled, to compensate for amounts not received because of the mod-troubled designation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department views the recapture of funds from a HA as a last resort since recapture adversely impacts on the residents
who have to continue to live in housing which needs rehabilitation. HUD staff is directed to exhaust all other means
of technical assistance, including requiring alternative oversight by a third party, to help HAs obligate and expend
funds. However, where such assistance does not work, HUD will recapture funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the concern regarding possible reduction in CGP funding, HUD has amended its FY 1995 budget request
to increase by $100 million funding for modernization up to $2.9 billion.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most commenters agreed with the concept of fungibility of work items to promote expenditure of oldest funds first
and recommended various ways that HUD could further speed up the process. First, to speed the flow of funds in the modernization
pipeline, HUD should substantially speed up HUD's own release of the modernization funds each year. The commenters
believed that most HAs do not get a funding reservation until late summer each year. HUD should be able to make each year's
new funding under CGP available to the HAs by no later than March 1. Commenters disagreed that the two-year obligation
period should begin with the ACC amendment. HAs stated that it can take up to 15 months to receive the ACC amendment.
HUD was asked to improve its performance in this area or continue to allow a five-year period. Allowing a five-year
period would give HAs maximum flexibility in scheduling modernization work. It was suggested that HUD's role should
be limited to monitoring PHA progress through the P&amp;E Report.

 HUD disagrees that it will take up to 15 months for HAs to have an executed ACC amendment and receive funds. HUD has streamlined
the ACC amendment process. As noted in Notice PIH 94&hyph;13 (entitled Expediting Obligation/Expenditure of Modernization
Funds in the Pipeline, issued April 6, 1994), the ACC amendment is prepared by Field Office program staff, reviewed
by the HUD Field Counsel and forwarded to the HA for signature. Unless required by State or local law or the HA by-laws,
the Executive Director is permitted to sign and return the ACC amendment without a Board Resolution. HAs are encouraged
to consider amending their by-laws (where permitted under law) so that a Board Resolution is not required or, if a Board
Meeting is not imminent, the HA may consider conducting a telephone Board Meeting to authorize the signing of the ACC
amendment. After ACC amendment, the Field Office should spread the budget line items in the Line of Credit Control
System/Voice Response System (LOCCS/VRS) as quickly as possible. As to the need to speed up the provision of funds
to HAs, HUD has made significant progress in this regard, and in fact, advised HAs of their funding amount in February
of this year. It is anticipated that additional progress will be made and access to funds will occur even earlier in
the FFY since HUD will provide only one formula amount and the Formula Characteristics Report for the next FFY will
be sent out for review and validation prior to the end of the current FFY. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD must again emphasize that there is no mandatory two-year obligation period, three-year expenditure period,
or 5-year statutory limit for spending funds approved in a particular FFY. Generally, HUD expects that funds allocated
in a FFY will be obligated within two years and expended within three years of approval unless a longer implementation
schedule is approved by HUD. The HA has responsibility for establishing its implementation schedule, as part of its
Annual Statement. In instances where it is unreasonable for a HA to meet the two year-three year expectation for obligation
and expenditure of funds, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., size of grant, complexity of the work, the HA may propose a schedule of longer duration. Also, as previously noted,
the HA may self-execute a time extension of the approved implementation schedule for reasons outside of its control.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD plans to speed up release of modernization funds to the extent possible. However, HUD disagrees that this affects
the modernization pipeline and suggests that addressing the pipeline is a reprogramming issue. For additional guidance
on the issue of reprogramming, see Notice PIH 94&hyph;13.

 Another area commented on as causing delay in the obligation of formula funding is the LOCCS/VRS automated draw-down
mechanism. Problems include systemic problems such as having to draw equal monthly amounts as well as persistent
problems with errors by Field Office staff in placing edits on accounts and not removing them in a timely fashion. Reports
were received indicating that some Field Office staff do not agree with the expedited policies and deliberately delay
the process.

 It was recommended that the obligation requirements should be made consistent with the annual submission section
which allows a HA to self-execute an extension when delays are out of its control. HUD was cautioned that while on the
surface accelerating the program's implementation schedule for obligating and expending funds would suggest a
quicker utilization of these dollars, such an acceleration without a transition period or a recognition of the needs
of larger HAs would likely result in either schedules not being met or those dollars being poorly utilized. They noted
that HAs are still shifting their modernization operations from one based on the CIAP to one based on CGP. HUD was urged
to review and alter other regulatory standards or work practices as the mechanism for accelerating the usage of Federal
modernization dollars.

 HUD again notes that the obligation time-frame is a general rule. If a HA can demonstrate that a longer obligation timeframe
is warranted, HUD may initially approve a time period longer than two years, and subsequently, a HA may extend the approved
implementation schedule if there are reasons outside of its control, as long as the extension is made in a timely manner.

 One HA noted that HUD's proposal was reasonable except for FFY 92 and FFY 93. In those years their plans included making
504 accessibility improvements, assessment and removal of lead-based paint, and capital improvements required
as the result of deferred maintenance and inadequate previous years funding under their operating budget and CIAP.
It was recommended that the changes under proposed rule for obligating funds not be retroactive to FFYs 92&hyph;94.

 This obligation guideline will now appear in the regulation and continues to be a guideline. Approved implementation

 HUD disagrees that a longer period is needed for larger HAs. HUD recognizes the concerns of the New York City Housing
Authority (NYCHA) and other HAs with over 10,000 units. HUD wants to point out that section 14 of the Act does not differentiate
between the types of submissions to be made by HAs participating in the CGP due to their size. Nevertheless, HUD believes
that the NYCHA and other large HAs will be benefitted, along with all other HAs participating in the CGP, as a result
of the simplified requirements contained in this final rule.

 CLPHA mentioned in its comments that HAs on the average nationwide now spend 80% of their modernization funds within
3.25 years from the time they receive their ACC amendment. In a large proportion of cases, the remaining 20% of the funds
are held up for a variety of reasons beyond the control of the HA (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unsatisfactory performance by contractors, litigation, unforeseen problems with lead-based paint, asbestos,
other hazardous materials or site problems). CLPHA recommended that PHA's PHMAP scores be based on the time it take
them to obligate or expend 80% of their modernization money, since this is much more within the control of the PHA. Another
commenter objected to the all or nothing bases of PHMAP. Although no suggestions were made, the PHA suggested as an
overall recommendation that a PHA's performance be based on whether they have accomplished the scope of work stated
in their work plan as opposed to whether they have residuals resulting from this plan.

 HUD has referred these comments to the PHMAP working group for consideration in the development of a revised PHMAP

of work, HUD may approve a schedule that exceeds the National guideline. PHMAP is based on whether they are performing
under the HUD-approved or extended schedule.

 While commmenters appreciated the mechanism of a prior corrective action order with appeal rights that the proposed

of this penalty, the agency must have been declared mod-troubled for at least one year; (b) The mod-troubled authority
must be failing to meet the objectives set forth in its Memorandum of Agreement; and (c) At least six months prior to
imposing the penalty, a team consisting of HUD personnel and better performing CGP agencies should be sent to the affected
authority to try to assist the agency in getting its program in order. Some commenters agreed that a HUD alternative
management strategy may be imposed as long as the HA is given a voice in the strategy.

 The comments present a rather rigid structure. HUD prefers to work with the HAs on a case-by-case basis and tailor its
technical assistance to HAs based on their specific needs before requiring an alternative strategy. HUD would only
require alternative management by a third party after a corrective action order had been issued and the HA failed to
comply with the order. Examples of technical assistance that may be provided include but are not limited to:

 It was proposed that HUD shall notify HAs of the requested date for submitting or updating a Comprehensive Plan. For
planning purposes, HAs may use the amount they received under CGP in the prior year in developing their Comprehensive
Plan or they may wait for the annual HUD notification of formula amount. One commenter conditionally supported this
proposal, and explained that without the formula amount, forms cannot be completely or accurately filled out. If
there is a major change in the formula amount, the planning and meetings with residents, staff, architects, governmental
agencies would have to be repeated. While the proposal may help, it was noted that it has the potential to also do a lot
of harm by creating more work and putting a HA into a very awkward and damaging position with staff, residents and local
agencies. IHA commenters were in favor of these changes. One commenter objected to the removal of the 30-day notice
for resident groups upon HUD's indication of the estimated funding level.

 A HA has the option to prepare its Comprehensive Plan/Annual Statement based on funding received in the prior year
and make adjustments before submission to HUD if the same amount of funding is not provided in the current year or the
HA can wait for the actual formula amounts before preparing its submission. HUD has retained the proposed provision,
and notes that with one formula amount, any difference between a presumptive estimate and a final formula amount is
eliminated. The accelerated approach which is optional, may use a dollar amount for planning purposes,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 last FFY's final formula amount, that is different from the actual formula amount for the current FFY. If there are
problems associated with that approach, the HA may continue to use the old approach (

must be received in the Field Office no later than July 15 each year in order to allow for the 75-day review period before
the end of the FFY. Since HUD will no longer provide an estimated formula amount, HUD has eliminated the requirement
for the initial notice. The level of detail and the format for the public notice has been left to local discretion.

 HUD proposed to expand the public notice requirements. HAs were to provide public notice of the advance meeting and

The information to be provided in the public notice was also to be expanded to include a summary of activities of the
previous year and progress update, estimated funding level, summary of CGP requirements, the estimated time frames
for completion of the required CGP documents and the requirement for resident participation in the planning, development
and monitoring of modernization activities under the CGP. In order to reach a much broader public, HAs stated that
they would have to use means beyond mailings to current residents. Commenters objected to the use of media such as newspapers,
radio and TV because it would greatly increase the cost to the HA, and HUD should allow an increase in the allowable administrative
costs to cover the additional expense. For the public at large, it was suggested that the HAs state that the required
information is available for inspection at various locations. Presenting a draft P&amp;E Report for all active funding
years would increase the HA's administrative burden. A simplified summary of active modernization projects and
management improvements in a format to be determined by the HA was suggested as sufficient for this stage of the process.

Other commenters found an improvement in the timing and manner of the notice, but also questioned the level of detail.
The listed details were thought to be more appropriate for the resident meetings and public hearings and the notice
should properly indicate that these details will be presented during these forums. Large HAs found there is no way
to simply summarize this information because any summary's level of detail would be so broad that the report would
be meaningless. It was also said to be impossible to summarize large HA's activities and progress on hundreds of contracts
representing hundreds of millions of dollars in contract work on any HA-wide notice. HAs requested the discretion
to provide such detail where feasible and appropriate. Recommended information in resident letters would include
basic information (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 level of funding and the time and place of the advance meeting) with the understanding that additional information
is available upon request at the HA's management office.

 HUD proposed that the HA shall hold, within a reasonable amount of time before the public hearing, an advance meeting
for residents and duly elected resident councils at which the HA shall explain the components of the Comprehensive
Plan. The meeting shall be open to all residents and duly elected resident councils. In addition, HUD requested comments
as to resident consultation regarding changes to the Five-Year Action Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters agreed that the timing of meetings with residents should be the decision of the HA. HUD was requested
to clarify to HAs, residents and HUD Field Offices that the residents' role is to advise and not approve. It was stated
that resident interest and concern are concentrated on the development in which they reside. Given the backlog of
critical work that must be done, such as replacing leaking roofs and complying with HUD mandates, there is often considerable
frustration about the inclusionary planning process when realistically there is not a lot of choice about what will
be done. Another HA noticed that resident involvement has diminished since it began conducting advance meetings.
One commenter objected to the removal of the three-week notification for a public hearing, following the advance
meeting because they considered the current rule to be a reasonable minimum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding resident consultation on changes to the Five-Year Action Plan, NAHRO suggested there is no need for a dollar
threshold nationwide. Each HA has its own method in place for consultation with residents. HAs are currently notifying
residents and their representatives and public officials about the CGP. They questioned what benefit further notification
requirements would provide. One HA proposed written notification to resident council presidents with a meeting
per local needs. They proposed to limit the definition of significant change to instances where a work item is deleted
or postponed from the Five-Year Plan. Modifications resulting from a reprogramming of unobligated funds from a work
item or in response to emergency needs should not be deemed as significant changes for resident consultation purposes.
IHAs that commented suggested that this consultation should be at the discretion of each HA. For a threshold, they
recommended that resident consultation would be in order when significant changes reach the cumulative total of
15% of the total grant amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter did not support putting the burden on the HA to create resident involvement. It was recommended that
HUD should mandate that a minimum of one notice be given to residents of the HA's intent to apply for funds combined with
a notice of one public hearing to solicit input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the proposed rule separates the planning process from the funding process, making resident
participation in the former of little consequence to the latter. Tenant consultation would have no meaningful purpose.
It was also suggested that this is inconsistent with the statute because HUD was fulfilling the resident consultation
requirements simply by engaging tenants in abstract discussions of modernization concerns, unrelated to any particular
year's funding decisions.

 The final rule incorporates the proposed rule provisions. HUD strongly recommends open and full communication between
the residents and the HA throughout the planning and funding process and believes that it is essential to achieve and
sustain viable public and Indian housing. As requested by the comments, the timing of meetings with the residents
should be at the discretion of the HA. HUD has decided not to impose thresholds on resident consultation for changes
within the Five-Year Action Plan. Although resident council involvement is not required whenever work items are
shifted within the Five-Year Action Plan, HUD believes that consultation is generally in the best interest of good
relations between the HA and the residents. The degree of consultation should be consistent with the degree of change
and that determination is at the discretion of the HA. HAs are encouraged to inform residents of significant changes.
Except for emergencies, items which are not in the Five-Year Action Plan require resident consultation and HUD approval
before being undertaken.

 HUD proposed that HAs hold annually at least one public hearing and any appropriate number of additional hearings
to ensure ample opportunity for residents, local government officials and other interested parties to express their
priorities and concerns. HAs were to give full consideration to the comments and concerns of residents, local government
officials, and other interested parties. NYCHA indicated that each year there are too many changes in their plans
to detail at the public hearing. NYCHA urged PHAs to provide detailed resident notification, and the best vehicle
for large PHAs to provide this notification is through Modernization and Maintenance Committee meetings at the development
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, it was commented that presenting a draft P&amp;E Report for all active funding years would increase
instead of decrease the HA administrative burden. The final report would need to prepared again in just a few months.
Adding the P&amp;E Reports to the agenda would compound the confusion in absorbing all this information during meetings.
A simple summary of active modernization projects and management improvements would suffice for this stage of the
process.

 In the final rule, HUD has left the level of detail up to the HA. However, the HA is required to present information on
the Comprehensive Plan/Annual Submission and progress of previously funded modernization programs. Development
level meetings are acceptable, but not required. By statute, HAs must hold at least one public hearing. The number
of additional meetings necessary is left to HA discretion.

 As part of its Comprehensive Plan, a HA is required to prepare various summaries. Some commenters questioned the level
of detail required. Rather than require less detail that would require more explanation after the fact, one HA suggested
that the required level of detail should be such that HUD will be able to make its eligibility and environmental needs
determination at the time of submission. PHADA suggested that the provision of work categories, quantity, and overall
costs, as opposed to work items and individual costs, is a workable compromise. It was requested that the rule more
clearly define the level of detail at this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue related to the level of detail was that because HUD proposes that the level of detail in the Annual Statement
and Five-Year Action Plan be consistent, this would result in increased detail in the balance of the Five-Year Plan.
It was found to be beneficial to use a consistent level of detail for all work, however a HA noted that the level of detail
should be in sufficient detail to relay the scope of work and cost for all reports,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the new Five-Year Plan and the P&amp;E Report. A further breakdown of work items in the P&amp;E Report would be an extraordinary
administrative burden for HAs and contractors and would be of questionable value and accuracy. Detailed cost documentation
exists in HA's files to support any work items that HUD would like to examine more closely.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD has adopted the recommendation that the level of detail be consistent in the Annual Statement, the Five-Year Action
Plan and the P&amp;E Report. The level of detail for physical work includes a description of major work categories,
quantity and cost. The level of detail for administrative and management improvement costs must be sufficient enough
for HUD to make a determination of eligibility. For example, the HA must describe training activities and how they
relate to identified physical or management improvement needs.

 The combination of annual statements and five-year plans at &sect;968.330 presented a statutory issue according
to ACORN. ACORN argued that this contradicts section 14(e)(3)(A) of the Act, which sets forth the requirement of PHAs
to produce an Annual Statement. Further, it was stated that this requirement is clearly distinct from the comprehensive
needs assessment and action plan described in subsections (e)(l)(A) and (e)(l)(D). ACORN stated that the combination
of the Annual Statement with the larger document will make interpretation of the single year's policymaking very
difficult. Site-specific data for residents will become confusing. Since the Five-Year Action Plan and Annual Statement
serve two distinct purposes, and since their merger will entail significant disadvantages in citizen participation,
they argued that the two should remain separate.

 It is not accurate to suggest that HUD has combined the Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan in a way that violates
the Act. The information related to the Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan remain distinguishable. The work
expected to be accomplished in each of the five years will be identified on a Work Statement for that year by major work
categories. Requiring HAs to only describe a major work category with quantity and cost without specifying work items
within a major work category is in keeping with the statutory intent of granting more flexibility to HAs and eases the
transition to full five-year fungibility. The HA must continue to provide residents with the opportunity to review
the Annual Statement and comment on it, and such comments must be taken into account in finalizing the Annual Statement
prior to submission to HUD. Definitions of Annual Statement, Work Statements and Annual Submission have been added
to the rule.

 Numerous comments were received concerning the level of detail in the Annual Statement versus the level of detail
in the P&amp;E Report. Currently, the level of detail is the same in both documents; however, in the proposed rule,
this provision was modified to require less detail in the Annual Statement and more detail in the P&amp;E Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One HA agreed with HUD's proposal to eliminate the current Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan and incorporate
their information into a modified Five-Year Action Plan. They agreed that requiring HAs to describe a major work category
with only quantity and cost without specifying work items is in keeping with the statutory intent of granting more
flexibility to HAs and as such eases the transition to full five-year fungibility. However, they requested that HUD
clarify the issue regarding ineligible costs in the Five-Year Action Plan. To further minimize major disagreements
at the end of the process, CLPHA recommended that HUD should clearly spell out in advance any items which HUD will consider
strictly ineligible. CLPHA urged that the list of ineligible items be shortened and that additional items be made
specifically eligible under CGP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAHR0 supported a five-year ``fungible'' approach to the CGP. However, NAHRO commented on the level of detail to be
required in the new Five-Year Action Plan. NAHRO was concerned by HUD's statement on ineligible costs. It was found
to give HAs the impression that when their P&amp;E Reports are filed with the Field Offices, work items can be disallowed
even if they are eligible expenses. In order for the Five-Year Action Plan to be ``fungible'' the actual details of
how the funds were spent should be included at the end of the year, not at the beginning, in the Annual Submission. Both
Field Offices and HAs should be familiar with eligibility of work items and guidance to both groups about eligible
costs should be clear. However, NAHRO did not want Field Offices to believe that they can disallow eligible items.
According to NAHRO, fungibility should allow the HA to decide what items they will do and where. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four IHAs indicated satisfaction with the guidance on eligible and ineligible costs, but noted that if HUD expands
and or clarify these lists, they suggest that IHA's should be included in developing such lists in light of their unique
modernization needs and differences from PHAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters questioned HUD's proposal that if the HA performs a work item that HUD will not be able to determine if
it was an eligible work item, then HA's would have to repay ineligible costs discovered during review of the P&amp;E
Report. It was suggested that this procedure could permit HUD to fail to properly review and then seek denial of funds
or reimbursement later. A better approach is for HUD to have sufficient detail in the Annual Statement in order to make
an eligibility determination up-front. This eliminates any question of how the HA should proceed. HUD still has the
authority to deny funds or seek reimbursement from the HA that has clearly performed ineligible work. The HA did not
support the Five-Year Action Plan minimal level of detail and the resulting discretion by HUD to seek reimbursement
for ineligible costs. Another suggested approach was to reduce the agency's future CGP amount to recoup the ineligible
expenditure.

CLPHA disagreed with the level of detail being proposed for the Five-Year Action Plan and for the P&amp;E Report. They
suggested that in the Five-Year Action Plan, references to quantities be eliminated and that the ``major work category''
along with a general description be considered acceptable. They acknowledged that PHAs must plan in detail, and HUD
could require them to maintain documentation in their files to support the work activities proposed. CLPHA indicated
that it would be desirable to keep the detail in the P&amp;E statements no greater than in the Five-Year Action Plan.
A further breakdown of work items in the P&amp;E Report would be a heavy administrative burden for PHAs and contractors,
and would be of questionable value and accuracy. For purposes of audits, HUD could reasonably require a PHA to keep
detailed cost documentation in its files, to support any work items that HUD would like to examine more closely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They considered the Two-Year Application a better option for reducing paperwork and the burden of review. The HA supported
the current level of detail required by the Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan versus the proposed Five-Year
Action Plan with one level of detail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments regarding the P&amp;E Report were mentioned and responded to above. The level of detail was the greatest
concern. One commenter noted that the proposed amendments will require them to develop the annual P&amp;E Report
in greater detail to cover a lack of detail in the Five-Year Action Plan. Generally, they had been moving from more detail
in the Physical Needs Assessment to lesser detail in their Annual P&amp;E Report. They wished to continue this practice.
They also hoped that HUD would continue to allow HA's to develop facsimiles of required HUD forms for the CGP that work
better with their housing stock while allowing them to work on the forms in spreadsheet format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To satisfy the proposed rule, one commenter thought it would have to keep two sets of records (one to prepare the limited
detail of the Five-Year Action Plan and another to write the P&amp;E Report). This change was found to not result in
any real saving of time or effort for HUD. It may reduce by, at most, two months the up-front processing time reviewing
HA submissions; however, HUD would still have to review each HA's P&amp;E Report in detail for line-item eligibility.
It was proposed that if it is beneficial for a HA to keep the current level of detail in its submitted plans and P&amp;E
Report, it should be able to do so. They suggested the following amendment: ``The Work Statement for all five years
will be, at least, at the current level of detail so that the HA may interchange work items as discussed in &sect;968.320(d)(5)(i).''
Adding any additional post-program review and evaluation was not found to be in the spirit of providing HAs with regulatory
relief. The time saved up-front is not worth the additional time spent responding to audits later on. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters recommended combining the two processes (P&amp;E Report and Annual Submission of Activities and Expenditures)
into one. One HA also requested that HAs not be burdened with generating resident interest in the preparation of this
report.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to permit full fungibility of work items in the Five-Year Action Plan, the level of detail with regard to work
items must be consistent in all five years. HUD proposed limiting the level of detail up-front to reduce administrative
burden to HAs. It was further proposed that HAs provide additional detail in the P&amp;E Report for purposes of determining
eligibility. However, after reviewing the comments, HUD agrees that the level of detail should be consistent in the
Annual Statement, the Five-Year Action Plan and the P&amp;E Report. Also, in keeping with HUD's commitment to simplify
the CGP and provide maximum flexibility wherever possible, HUD has streamlined the level of detail that must be provided.
The rule now requires HAs to specify major work categories, quantities and costs. For example, 100 kitchens at Development
X for a total of $100,000. The level of detail for administrative and management improvement costs must be sufficient
enough for HUD to make a determination of eligibility. HUD already may request additional information (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for eligibility determinations) to facilitate review and approval of the Annual Submission during the 75-day review
period. HUD notes that HAs have the responsibility for ensuring that only eligible modernization work items are charged
to the CGP. As previously noted, work items, including the purchase of equipment, must be directly related to carrying
out physical and management improvements identified in the Needs Assessments. Such work must be modest in design
and cost, but still blend in with the design and architecture of the surrounding community. HAs are advised to keep
supporting documentation relative to work items within the major work category for monitoring and auditing purposes
and such information must be made available to HUD upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD wishes to maintain a partnership with HAs throughout the CGP process and minimize concerns regarding the eligibility
of work items. Eligible work items include those which are modest in design and cost, but still blend in with the design
and architecture of the surrounding communities by including amenities, quality materials and design and landscaping
features that are customary for the locality and culture. However, if a HA has a question on the possible eligibility
of a work item, it should consult with the Field Office. Should a HA expend funds for ineligible work items, HUD will
require repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAs may develop facsimiles of required HUD forms as long as they contain all of the required information in a format
that reasonably approximates the actual format.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Generally, IHAs supported retaining TDC while HAs preferred other methods. One PHA supported the current method
of TDC and the 90% requirement. However, the PHA suggested that, HAs have the option to use CGP funds to supplement other
funds to demo and replace units where that option is most advantageous to HUD and the HA. Thus, if the HA intends to modernize
a project at 80% of TDC, it should have the option to add 20% of other funding to demolish and rebuild the complex. This
option could require review and approval by HUD, and the Public Hearing and Resident Group review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters noted that often, the HA spends an inordinate amount of time after the architect develops the plans and
specifications trying to determine how or what should be cut from the minimum to construct the development. We should
be striving for quality not a specific quantity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters were pleased with the proposed new way of evaluating cost reasonableness, namely by evaluating the costs
of individual types of work items and comparing them with published private construction cost standards. CLPHA recommended
that a PHA be allowed to demonstrate cost reasonableness under any of the three following methods: (a) The current
approach using 90% of TDCs; (b) the cost reasonableness approach related to the cost of individual work proposed by
HUD in the proposed rule, but also allowing PHAs to submit additional data concerning local market conditions as they
relate to published cost indicators; or (c) sealed pre-bid estimates to be compared to the competitive bids received
for such work. Once approved, the definition used by the PHA would remain constant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested that HUD should allow HAs to develop their own methods of determining the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonableness of planned work. These cost evaluations should not be submitted to HUD on an annual basis and should
not have to be retained by HAs for HUD review. The time and cost of generating this kind of data in a form suitable for HUD
audit could be significant. Pre-bid estimates and competitive bids received for work should be adequate to document
the reasonableness of cost for work items. HUD was urged to use a sufficiently expansive definition of reasonable
cost to permit HAs to utilize very durable materials and construction techniques and revised modernization standards
critical to ensuring a development's long-term viability. HUD was also urged to implement a similar standard for
its development program. In particular, development cost must: (a) Be more reflective of local and changing conditions;
(b) expand beyond the modest design standards; and (c) provide adequate square footage for today's family needs.

NAHRO recommended that the reasonable cost determinations still be compared to the cost of new development. They
also suggested a viability assessment must allow both approaches, a cumulative approach, such as a comparison of
the total cost of modernization as compared to the total cost of new development or as the Department suggests, a cost
reasonable test of the work items proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PHADA applauded the removal of the artificial TDC caps, but remained concerned about the level of detail PHAs will
have to keep in their files and the form of the annual HUD review. Management choices are an essential part of this process
and they were worried about some HUD personnel second-guessing authority decisions, thus leading to huge, unnecessary,
battles. HUD was requested to clearly address the level of detail for filing in the handbook revisions. There was also
an expressed need to prevent redundant files where work is publicly bid and selected architect/engineers provide
cost estimates prior to bidding. No program benefit was found in further administrative procedures that do not impact
construction quality or timeliness of expenditures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One PHA was concerned that if HUD does not establish a procedure it will be left to Field Office definition. The PHA suggested
that local authorities be given the discretion to define reasonableness and have HUD approve the definition. Once
approved, the definition would remain constant. The issue of cost reasonableness also illustrates the need for greater
flexibility to do a cost analysis of rehabilitation of the existing units versus demolition and new construction.
While a PHA does not want to see HUD reduce its responsibility to provide a steady funding source for new construction
of public housing units, they believed that it is important to look at the cost reasonableness. The PHA was also seeking
that the revised regulations permit this flexibility in scattered sites. It could be limited to specific units where
the cost analysis demonstrated the cost-effectiveness and long-term viability of new construction.

 In the rule, HUD has clarified that long-term viability includes ensuring structural/system integrity and full
occupancy. For cost reasonableness, HUD has decided that HAs may choose one of two methods to determine cost reasonableness:
(1) unfunded modernization hard costs do not exceed 90% of computed TDC; or (2) individual work items are reasonable
in accordance with National cost indices, adjusted by local conditions and the HA's own recent procurement experience.

 All but one commenter supported HUD's proposed five-year fungibility. HAs found that full fungibility will allow
HAs more flexibility to undertake and complete rehabilitation and modernization work at their housing developments.
The elimination of the need for preparing amendments for HUD approval before work items may be interchanged from one
year to another was predicted to save countless hours for both HAs and HUD Field Offices. While HAs wholeheartedly
supported fungibility, some indicated a preference for it to be based on the Needs Assessments, rather than the Five-Year
Action Plan. HAs stated a general principle that once a HA has established a need in their Needs Assessments, they would
not have to request prior approval from HUD to fund that item. The condition of a development's physical plant can change
dramatically from one year to the next. HAs, not HUD, were found to be in a better position to decide what work items need
to be funded and when. Any extra level of approval was seen as not keeping with HUD's goal of increasing HA discretion
and responsibility. It was also asserted that this would enable HAs to better and more rapidly address changing conditions
without an extensive, interim public and HUD review process. Such reviews were considered more appropriate at the
annual submission and performance and evaluation stages of the CGP. However, some HAs and CLPHA opposed the proposed
requirement for HUD approval of any item not included in the current five-year plan as unrealistic, overly restrictive
and would negate the benefits intended by full fungibility. Preparing budget revision proposals and the turnaround
time involved in seeking HUD approval could result in project delays. With the increased emphasis for timely obligation
and expenditure of funds, they were concerned that this restriction would make those goals more difficult to achieve.
It was recommended that HAs should be able to add items to their current year modernization activities without HUD
approval if these items are shown in their needs assessment (even if not included in the HA's Five-Year Action Plan),
or are of similar type to items in their approved plan. HAs should also be able to add emergency items, or items certified
by the HA as otherwise eligible and approvable, without further approval from HUD, provided that any items so added
will not result in the deletion of any work item from the Five-Year Action Plan. Only if a HA proposes to delete an item
from its Five-Year Action Plan should it have to notify HUD, or changes should be allowed for any item identified in
an approved needs assessment up to a predetermined percentage cap. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One HA supported the proposal to allow a HA to perform emergency work not outlined in its Five-Year Action Plan without
prior HUD approval. As an incentive for high performers, one HA suggest that high performers should be allowed to not
report on changes in excess of 10% of the grant other than on the yearly P&amp;E Report, along with giving a reason for
the change.

 HUD has adopted the proposed version of fungibility. HUD has not revised its approach to be based on the Needs Assessments
because it would be too broad and would circumvent the resident and local government consultation requirements.
HAs are currently able to add emergency work items, and will continue to be able to do so without HUD approval. HAs cannot
add other work items to the Five-Year Action Plan without HUD approval. Full fungibility will be allowed within the
five-year period spanned by the latest HUD-approved Five-Year Action Plan. It should also be noted that the five-year
fungibility eliminates the need to report on changes in excess of 10% of the annual grant other than on the yearly P&amp;E
Report.

 One commenter saw a need to define fungibility in the rule. The following definition of fungibility was proposed:
``Fungibility. The ability to exchange CIAP or Comprehensive Grant program dollars or work items prospectively
or retroactively, between any years covered by an ACC, Five-Year Action Plan or Needs Assessment.'' It was also noted
that additional references to ``fungibility'' should be altered to conform to this definition.

 Fungibility is a concept reflected throughout the rule. Fungibility permits a HA to substitute any work item from
the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan to any previously approved CIAP budget or CGP Annual Statement and to move
work items among approved budgets without prior HUD approval. This definition of fungibility appears in the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NYCHA indicated that applying fungibility only to those jobs included in the current Five-Year Action Plan is too
restrictive. This HA wanted to be able to apply the fungibility principle to unobligated work items_past, present,
or future (currently in either an approved implementation schedule or their needs assessment (including both CIAP
and CGP-funded items)). By authorizing ``retroactive fungibility'' in the CGP rule and with guidance in the Handbook,
NYCHA expected a significant increase in PHA flexibility and responsiveness to modernization needs. NYCHA suggested
that retroactive fungibility will allow a PHA to close out its older programs on schedule and will also aid in reprogramming
underruns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the time period for the fungibility of work items, it was suggested that full fungibility should be
allowed within the five-year period spanned by a Five-Year Action Plan's rolling base. If fungibility is tied to our
initial Five-Year Action Plan (submitted in FFY 92), they expected to move work items from FFY 96 into their FFY 94 CGP
budget, but not items from FFY 97. If fungibility is tied to the rolling base Five-Year Action Plan, developed each
year by dropping off the initial year and adding a subsequent year for their Annual Submission, they could move work
items from FFY 98 into their FFY 94 CGP budget. Another commenter found it would be much simpler to have a fixed five-year
period with changes and updates made annually to that plan. In the fifth year a new Five-Year Action Plan for the next
five years would be submitted and approved. This HA found a lot of difficulty in trying to explain to residents that
the first year of the 1993 budget was the same as the second year of the 1992 budget but that they were different because
some items had been revised or changed.

 HUD does not agree with the suggestions that fungibility should apply to all unobligated work items and any work items
in the Needs Assessment. If HUD permitted the use of the Needs Assessments for purposes of fungibility, the five-year
planning and resident partnership processes could be circumvented. The Five-Year Action Plan has a rolling base
and is updated annually. The approval of the Five-Year Action Plan submitted for the current FFY supersedes other
previously approved Five-Year Action Plans. For example, the current Five-Year Action Plan may cover FFYs 1994&hyph;1998.
However, a HA may substitute a major work category from the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan into a 1992 CGP or
a 1991 CIAP budget, but it cannot substitute work that only appears in the Needs Assessments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be clarified that HUD approval is not required for moving previously approved work among previously approved
budgets. In addition, HUD approval is not required for reprogramming if funds remain after completion of a work item
where the funds will be used for any item in the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan or an approved CIAP budget or Annual
Statement. The HA may also self-execute a time extension, if necessary, to use the leftover funds.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the proposed rule, fungibility centers on the interchangeability of work items between funding programs prior
to obligation. However, for one large HA, fungibility of dollars during the expenditure period would be just as useful.
Numerous circumstances beyond a PHA's control can make it impossible to close a contract, and with it the funding program,
within the five-year statutory limit. When such circumstances occur, the monies remaining in a funding program about
to expire should be used for payments on contracts in later funding programs. In a sense, PHAs would be creating post-award,
``split funded'' contracts. Fungibility of dollars is the expenditure version of using old money first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Post-obligation fungibility of contract dollars would allow PHAs to closeout old funding programs within the five-year
funding deadline and would yield a more accurate picture of the PHAs ability to expend modernization funds. The rule
should provide directly for post-obligation fungibility, and this important subject should not be left for handbook
interpretation, as suggested in the proposed rule's preamble.

 As previously noted, there is no statutory five-year funding deadline. HUD wishes to emphasize that fungibility
relates to major work categories, not dollars. The dollars approved in a particular grant, e.g., 701, are tracked
against that grant number. A HA may fund work categories in total or in part from a particular grant. If the cost of a work
category is in excess of the funds available in 701, the HA may charge up to the total amount of funds remaining in 701
and add that work category to another grant, e.g., 702. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department issued Notice PIH 94&hyph;13 (HA), Expediting Obligation/Expenditure of Modernization Funds in
the Pipeline, on April 6, 1994. HAs should refer to this Notice which specifically discusses methods which HAs may
wish to use to obligate and expend their oldest modernization funds before charging work against newer programs.

 One commenter suggested a revised CGP process. It would require an approval process only every five years. The plan
would be updated annually with changes made to reflect actual funding costs as tasks are completed, items added and/or
deleted from the Plan or moved to different years. A new fifth year would not be added each year. Only new items added
to the Plan would require HUD approval and interim year changes would require documented consultation with the tenants
at a public meeting. PHAs could expend funds from any grant year against any item in the approved Plan. An example of
a Plan was also provided.

As previously mentioned only one commenter opposed the proposed fungibility provisions. They argued that this was
an attempt to circumvent the statutory five-year planning requirements. They asserted that full fungibility is
inconsistent with the Act because it violated the requirement of a schedule to prioritize work items during the Five-Year
Action Plan. The full fungibility was said to remove the scheduled order of the planning process. The second perceived
inconsistency was the exemption of HAs from the amendment process outlined in the Act which describes how changes
to the approved plan may be made. They interpreted the Act to require HAs to wait until their submission of an annual
statement, with appropriate tenant consultation and public comment, before elements of the comprehensive plan
are to be changed. It was also stated that full fungibility is bad public policy. The proposed rule gives HAs absolute
discretion over modernization funds upon award. They found this to be an abdication of Federal responsibility. They
asserted that this approach is also problematic because modernization is a troubled program with an enormous pipeline
and an inability to impact the profound repair needs in public housing. HUD was charged with the failure of the modernization
program due to its poor oversight and HA's weak management practices and financial operations.

 HUD cannot change the comprehensive grant process to a once every five years submission process. The Act requires
an Annual Statement. The Five-Year Action Plan is also a statutory requirement. Fungibility is not inconsistent
with the Act. The Act provides that as long as the activities and expenditures are consistent with the approved plan,
the HA shall have total discretion in expending assistance for any activity or work set forth in the plan. HAs are to
certify that they have provided residents of the housing affected by the planned activities the opportunity to review
the Annual Statement and comment on it, and that such comments have been taken into account in formulating the Annual
Statement as submitted to the Secretary.

 The Act requires that work items be included in a Comprehensive Plan or Annual Statement before modernization funds
may be spent on the work items, except in the case of emergencies. The Act also provides that work items may not appear
in the Annual Statement or Five-Year Action Plan unless the need for the work has been identified in the Physical or
Management Needs Assessments. Therefore, this comment was not accepted because the Needs Assessments have to be

 HAs and CLPHA objected to the requirement for submission of a totally new Comprehensive Plan in the sixth year of a HA's
participation in the CGP, but suggested allowing HAs to keep updating the Five-Year Action Plan's rolling base so
that it would continue indefinitely. Another comment was that the requirement for a development-by-development
analysis of whether the improvements will (a) reasonably ensure the long-term viability of the development at a reasonable
cost or (b) is necessary to maintain habitability until residents can be relocated does not accomplish any purpose.
Another commenter suggested that HUD's inclusion of ``essential non-routine maintenance necessary to maintain
habitability'' is good but requires further clarification (such as including routine maintenance costs that are
excessively high as a direct result of the units' need for comprehensive modernization work).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD has retained the requirement for the submission of an updated Comprehensive Plan every sixth year. However, the
submission requirements have been reduced by eliminating two components of the Executive Summary, which are the
strategy statement and the statement regarding the HA's plans for developments funded for comprehensive modernization
under CIAP. Therefore, the additional documents which must be submitted in the sixth year are: Summary of total preliminary
estimated costs; description of the resident participation process and summary of general issues; and revised and
updated Physical and Management Needs Assessments. The Five-Year Action Plan, which is also part of the Comprehensive
Plan, must be submitted in any case. While HAs may elect to update annually the Physical and Management Needs Assessments
by eliminating work already funded and adding newly identified work, there is no requirement for HAs to submit these
updates to HUD. HAs are only required to submit updated Needs Assessments to HUD if they wish to undertake work which
was not previously identified on the Needs Assessments. HUD feels that a completely updated Comprehensive Plan every
sixth year will provide valuable information to both HUD and the public on how well the CGP is meeting HA needs, as well
as the types and dollar estimates of unmet needs.

The Act requires the development-by-development analysis of whether the improvements will reasonably ensure the
long-term viability of the development at a reasonable cost. HUD has added the alternative of maintaining habitability
where reasonable cost cannot be met and an interim period is needed to provide housing until relocation for the residents
can be arranged. When providing ``essential non-routine maintenance necessary to maintain habitability'', a HA
is required to do so in the most efficient and economical manner and within the eligibility guidelines of the CGP. Routine
maintenance costs are ineligible. However, work items that would ordinarily be performed on a regular basis but have
become substantial in scope because they have been put off, and involve expenditures that would otherwise materially
distort the level trend of maintenance expenses are eligible CGP costs under the definition of nonroutine maintenance.

mechanics in the process. Similar questions as previously raised above were expressed on the fungibility of work
items between years and the requirement for HAs to consult to the extent practicable with residents on significant
changes. One HA noted that based on their experience with HUD, the term practicable imposed an impossibly high standard

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters raised the same issues on the annual submission procedures as they did for the Five-Year Action Plan and
Comprehensive Plan. Most HAs agreed that they would prefer to develop their preliminary plans based upon the amount
of money they had received in the prior year, and not finalize these plans until HUD announces the final amounts for
the current year. The public notice, advance meetings, public hearing, and level of detail concerned many commenters.
Commenters also suggested that either some parameters be defined regarding the time allotment for corrections or
that some other mechanism be defined by which a HA may have recourse to unreasonable time constraints. Commenters
supported the proposal authorizing HAs to self-execute an extension of target dates contained in the annual submission
for fund obligation and expenditure when a delay outside of its control occurs. Penalties for missed target dates
concerned the commenters. One HA suggested an option of a two-year application that eliminates one year of application.
NAHRO suggested that the P&amp;E Report be submitted at the same time as the annual submission of the Five-Year Action
Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters supported the proposal which requires only an annual report and its intent to involve HA residents. However,
HUD was directed not to place a burden on HAs to create resident interest and councils. It was proposed that HUD should
mandate that HAs make information available, and the methods and format should be left to local discretion. Only one
hearing each year was recommended and advanced meetings were not needed because the residents should have been working
on the plan and know what it contains. HUD was asked to develop a system by which it could certify that authorities with
effective resident participation processes would not have to have an advance hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CLPHA agreed that HAs should be allowed the option of advance planning, to complete their annual updates before the
final modernization awards are announced. However, they urged HUD not to require HAs to do this because local circumstances
vary.

 These comments have been addressed above. HUD again emphasizes that the Annual Statement is statutory. HUD reviews
the P&amp;E Report before approving the next year's submission in order to determine if corrective actions are needed.
Therefore, NAHRO's suggestion for simultaneous submission could hinder early approval of the Annual Statement
and access to funds. HAs must be accountable to the residents. There must be a partnership process which is documented.
HAs must annually conduct both an advance meeting and a public hearing. The format has been left to HA discretion. Also,
as previously mentioned, HUD is providing the option for advance planning.

 As previously mentioned in other comments, it was suggested that this section should also clarify timeliness. When
referring to the obligation of funds, it was suggested that it should make reference to legitimate self-executed
time extensions and also take into consideration any other delays that were outside of the HA's control.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Timeliness includes meeting HUD-approved implementation schedules, or HA-executed time extensions which are
the result of delays beyond the control of the HA. HUD annually reviews these schedules and may review these schedules
more frequently as needed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters emphasized that HAs should be given discretion, flexibility, responsibility and control of their CGPs.
Changes to the CGP program should contribute to the greater discretion, flexibility, responsibility and control
of the local HAs and their residents. HAs should maintain control over methods of working with and meeting with residents,
determining and prioritizing needed improvements, determining the methods to accomplish these improvements,
establishing budgets, generating bid documents, entering into contracts, and determining the clearest methods
of providing HUD with required information such as comprehensive plans, annual submissions and P&amp;E Reports.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters recommended that HUD eliminate the thresholds for LOCCS/VRS because they found the threshold amounts
are insufficient and result in Field Office review for approval. They found this is often time consuming and results
in delays in payments and delays in fund expenditure. HAs favored eliminating the percentage limitations on monthly
draw-downs. In addition, it was recommended that the eight percent draw-down limit be lifted for high performers.
It was noted that because the modernization process results in low levels of expenditure during early design phases
and high levels of expenditures when one or more construction contracts are in process, HAs have frequently exceeded
the percentage limitation and delayed requesting funds or sought HUD approval to request additional funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 LOCCS/VRS contains an edit limiting the total cumulative amount that any HA can draw down in a current month without
triggering Field Office review. The limit is set forth as a percentage of the annual grant and varies by size of the annual
grant (from 2 percent to 8 percent). The Department is reevaluating these percentages to determine if they are overly
restrictive and result in an excessive number of requisitions requiring Field Office review. If the Department finds
this to be the case, the Department will adjust the percentages accordingly. However, it should be noted that Field
Office review should not result in lengthy delays in payment. When a HA's voucher is flagged for review, the HA should
immediately call the Field Office and explain the circumstances. Based on the HA's telephone explanation, the Field
Office may decide to release the voucher or request additional documentation. Extensive documentation is not needed
in most cases.

 Once the ACC amendment is executed by HUD, the Field Office must enter the Budget Line Items (BLIs) into LOCCS/VRS before
HAs may requisition funds. The Field Office may not enter the BLIs into LOCCS/VRS before the fund obligation (ACC amendment)
is recorded in the Program Accounting System (PAS).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter opposed entering expended and obligated funds into LOCCS on a quarterly basis because it requires extensive
research and data preparation as well as requiring more frequent budget revisions. A two-day turnaround on the supply
of funds through the LOCCS was requested (currently it is three days). Full fungibility was also requested to be reflected
in LOCCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department believes that obtaining quarterly information on obligations and expenditures is essential to monitoring
implementation progress by HAs. This requirement should not be burdensome since HAs should be maintaining this information
as part of their own financial systems and controls. The Department would like to point out that the need for budget
revisions triggered by obligations and expenditures will be greatly diminished by the provision of fungibility.

 The Department has taken steps to revise the existing BLI edits in LOCCS/VRS to accommodate fungibility. Specifically,
the existing soft edit of 110% will be removed for the following BLIs: 1430, 1440, 1450, 1460, 1465, 1470, 1475, and
1495. In addition, the existing edits for BLIs 1408 and 1410 will be revised.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters suggested changes regarding space guidelines. One PHA suggested that HUD should delete the maximum
space guidelines for administrative, maintenance and community space. Instead, PHAs should determine the amount
of space, the configuration of space and type of space appropriate based on the intended usage. The needs and usages
of space were stated to vary widely and did not warrant an arbitrary imposition of a set square footage criteria. Providing
space for service providers serving HA residents including community organizations, Head Start, early childhood
education, parent education, English as a second language, medical clinics, food shelf, teen centers, drug elimination
activities, employment and Section 3 training, family self-sufficiency should be a high priority for use of these
HUD funds.

 Non-dwelling space standards are to be viewed as guidance, not mandatory. HAs may exceed the standards. However,
the Department notes that modernization funds may be used only to provide space which is primarily for the benefit
of the public housing residents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another PHA suggested that HAs should have the ability to convert all existing non-dwelling space (whether previous
dwelling space or not) into dwelling space. This ability could ease the unit loss impact of complying with Section
504 as well as address design deficiency conditions.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The CGP Handbook 7485.3 cites the extension of exterior walls to enlarge interior dwelling space or provide for physical
accessibility as an ineligible work item. HUD has decided to revise its policy and to amend the regulations to allow
the adding of dwelling space to existing units, including Mutual Help and Turnkey III units. However, it is noted that
HAs are not required to exercise this option in order to meet 504 requirements. Modernization funds may not be used
to construct or acquire additional public housing units. The HA may use its own funds to provide additional dwelling
units, but without a reservation of development funds, such units will not be covered by the ACC and, therefore, not
included in the operating subsidy calculation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment was received which indicated that the proposal to require HUD conduct environmental reviews of all proposed
activities in the Five-Year Action Plan should be a part of the burden on the HA to obtain an independent environmental
analysis and submit it to HUD prior to modernization activities occurring. The commenter concluded that HUD did not
have the travel funds nor the staff to do this type of review and suggested that HAs could hire and train residents out
of management improvement funds to perform these reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is required by law to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and related environmental
and historic preservation laws before approving funding for specific developments. The provision for fungibility
of work within the entire Five-Year Action Plan means that the Department must make this determination on an annual
basis for each development within the Five-Year Action Plan. This responsibility cannot be delegated to HAs. On April
11, 1994, S. 1299 became law, and added, among other things, a new Section 26 to the United States Housing Act of 1937,
as amended. This new Section 26 authorizes the Department to designate a State or unit of general local government
to assume the responsibilities for environmental review. The authorization for State and local governments to conduct
such reviews continues a statutory precedent embodied in the legislation of other HUD programs. The delegations
are limited to entities with general governmental powers to control development, land use, development standards
and special mitigation requirements. HAs do not possess these powers and do not qualify for such delegations. In order
to implement this new Section 26, the Department must issue regulations after consultation with the Council on Environmental
Quality. Until those regulations are issued, the Department must continue to comply with NEPA and related environmental
and historic preservation laws by undertaking the required reviews itself and cannot delegate any responsibilities
to State or local governments. In addition, it should be noted that Field Offices are encouraged to maintain previously
completed environmental reviews on file and update them as necessary when undertaking the required reviews.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments were made on HUD's discussion of procurement procedures in the preamble to the proposed rule.
CLPHA indicated that PHAs have identified possible conflicts between comprehensive grant procurement procedures
and the requirements of other HUD procurement rules. CLPHA recommended that HUD ask PHAs for recommendations in this
area, then follow up to clarify these areas and provide PHAs with greater flexibility and consistency. One PHA wanted
to see additional information addressing contract administration in the revised CGP Handbook. PHAs and CLPHA recommended
an extensive review of procurement requirements to identify proper and appropriate ways to simplify or ease how HAs
contract for work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suggested items included establishing procedures for HAs to better utilize alternative procurement vehicles like
state procurement, job order contracting, and a revived, modified HUD Consolidated Supply Program and accelerating
the approval process of HUD Form 5230, the Previous Participation Certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A PHA suggested the use of competitive proposals and indicated that the seven percent administrative cost limit would
not be required to be increased because it would be part of the contract cost. Another commenter disagreed and indicated
that this method was not successful for development of public housing units and would not be appropriate for modernization
except on a small scale at a limited number of HAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's clarification on the use of indefinite quantity contracts for A/E services and the ability to perform modernization
work through competitive proposals was viewed as a real benefit in expediting construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One PHA disagreed with the limit on modifications or contract modifications in the Handbook (7460.8, REV.1 dated
1/14/93, paragraph 11&hyph;1 (e). They challenged the rational for this requirement since they may award construction
contracts exceeding several million dollars without prior HUD approval, but must obtain HUD approval on all contract
modifications exceeding $25,000. In addition, HAs are not required to forward contract documents to the Field Offices
which would appear to make it difficult to approve any contract modification. The present process was found to slow
down construction. It was requested that HAs be allowed to authorize contract modifications up to 10% of the original
contract amount without prior HUD approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CLPHA commented that pre-qualification of vendors should be encouraged and expedited.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Seven comments were received on HUD's proposal to monitor each HA's Section 3 efforts. One commenter noted that HUD
did not specify which division or department would do this, and recommended that training should be provided. One
commenter cautioned HUD on the impact its proposals would have on CGP and recommended HUD gather input from people
who work in this area. To further Section 3 efforts, a PHA suggested that residents registered with the HA as trainees
be exempt from the HUD-determined wage Rates and Davis-Bacon wage rates. The resident trainee rates could be approved
by HUD the same as HUD determined wage rates. By analogy to Connecticut law, one PHA noted that their housing construction
programs required 25% of the dollar value of the contract be sub-contracted to Minority Business Enterprises and
that 25% of that amount be awarded to Women's Business Enterprises. This was stated to produce verifiable results
and has been very effective. Another PHA supported HUD's effort and suggested HA's focus more of their resources on
the Section 3 process and involve more residents in the distribution of work and training program. CLPHA indicated
that by FFY 95, HUD expects to have an effective final rule implementing the amended Section 3 which proposes that PHAs
certify as to compliance with Section 3 and provide anticipated projections based on best efforts. PHAs can certify
as to compliance with Section 3 but CLPHA stated it was unreasonable to expect projections as to the number of jobs or
type of training available through various contracts. This was found to only be determined by the successful contractor.
The additional costs of carrying out Section 3 training should also be taken into account in evaluating bids according
to CLPHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAHRO disagreed with any request for numerical targets because annual targets are influenced by a number of factors
beyond the PHA's or contractor's control, and monitoring and reporting regarding such targets creates paper games.
NAHRO did not find a program-by-program approach to necessarily be effective in creating real employment for residents.
NAHRO recommended that PHAs establish goals authority-wide to comply with Section 3, of which CGP is one component.
To foster successful implementation of Section 3, HUD should work with public housing industry groups as well as contractors
and unions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Section 3) (as amended by the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992) requires that employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance
for housing and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and
very low-income persons, particularly, those who are recipients of government assistance for housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of Section 3 apply to HAs for modernization activities, notwithstanding the amount of the assistance
provided to the HA or the amount of the contract or subcontract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For CGP, the Section 3 rule requires HAs to certify compliance with Section 3 and demonstrate this compliance by committing
``to the greatest extent feasible'' to meet the numerical goals set in the Section 3 interim rule (24 CFR 135.30). For
CGP, HUD requested through the letter transmitting the FY 1994 presumptive estimate, that each HA to the greatest
extent feasible, establish and commit to numerical goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each HA is required to submit, with the annual P&amp;E Report, an annual Section 3 report on Form HUD&hyph;60002. The
HA must document actions taken to comply with the requirements of Section 3, the results of actions taken and impediments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the process of development of the Section 3 interim rule and data collection, the Department held meetings
with various housing authorities, industry groups and organizations which are currently subject to compliance
with Section 3 or share interest in the regulatory implementation of Section 3.

 Three commenters concluded that a constant or increasing level of funding for CGP is required if HAs are to complete
required improvements on public housing properties to ensure their long-term viability. Decreases in funding levels
results in only emergency work being completed and destroys HA's ability to do long range planning and follow thorough
on commitments made to the residents. Significant decreases from year to year (anything exceeding 10%) was stated
to result in delays in implementing completed design work (risking the need to revise work based on changing existing
conditions) and decreased resident participation and interest.

 Wage rate determinations have become increasingly problematic in their timing and completeness. They are received
after contracts are executed and sometimes many months of construction has already been completed. Often there is
no wage rate determination given for requested classifications.

 The Department is unaware of any widespread or systemic problems involving the provision of Davis-Bacon wage determinations
for modernization projects. HUD is installing a Davis-Bacon wage determination database to expedite the provision
of determinations.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Expedite wage-rate issuances. HUD should expedite Davis-Bacon issuances and eliminate variances between HUD and
DOL requirements. The date of the wage decision should be the date of the start of the contract. HAs shouldn't have to
delay opening of the bids because of a ``pending wage decision.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD works closely with DOL to assure that wage determinations are made available for projects in a timely manner. This
means that the wage determinations must be made available for incorporation into bid solicitations. There are projects
which are subject to HUD-determined wage rates (``non-routine'' maintenance) rather than DOL-determined wage
rates which are issued under the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts. Resultant variations in wages which may be issued are
due to the fact that the work is defined differently and the rates are determined under separate legal authorities.
The applicable Davis-Bacon wage determination for a particular project is ``locked in'' at the award of the contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An HA suggests that HUD encourage local expenditures. Although Consolidated Supply type programs provide competitive
rates, they do nothing for the local economy. The HA suggested that HUD emphasize the ``buy locally'' proposition
in order to best stimulate the HA's local economy.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HAs are required to follow the Department's regulation at 24 CFR 85.36 for the procurement of goods and services. This
regulation was developed pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;102, Uniform Administrative
Requirements for Grants to State and Local Governments, to provide consistent government-wide procurement standards
in Federal grant programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the fundamental principles of the regulation is that all procurements are to be conducted in a manner to promote
full and open competition. The principle is intended to ensure equal treatment among contractors, while providing
the most advantageous prices in the market place, particularly when the Federal government is providing the funds.
Consistent with the concept of providing equal treatment among contractors is a specific requirement in the regulation
prohibiting the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-state or local geographical preferences in the
award of contracts. Further, restricting competition to local contractors will not yield HAs the best prices in the
market place. This is particularly important with limited Federal resources. Accordingly, the Department does
not accept the comment that HUD should emphasize the ``buy locally'' proposition in order to stimulate the HA's local
economy.

HUD Assistance: Handbook and Field Offices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nine comments provided advice on better ways to give assistance to program participants. One suggestion was to reinforce
the concept of enhanced flexibility with rational handbook guidelines and grant Field Offices sufficient authority
to adapt the regulation to local conditions. Field Office and PHA partnerships were praised such as the relationship
between the St. Paul HA and the Minneapolis Field Office. Further delegation of approvals and discretion to Field
Offices was suggested. Additional Field Office staff training was recommended. The Handbook was found to be deficient
on implementation guidance. IHAs expressed a need for extensive assistance on the new rule. Four IHAs also strongly
recommended that each Office of Native American Programs should have a full time CIAP/CGP Director/Coordinator
or fund NAIHC additional monies to allow them to give technical assistance to those IHAs needing additional support.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD was directed to give clear, strict instructions to its Field Offices that establish time deadlines for Field Office
action on HA requests, including approvals of RFPs, recommendations for awards, 2530 approvals and approving of
waivers. If HUD does not act within 14 days, HAs suggested that the items should be approved. Departmental review and
approval of CGP submissions was also mentioned as improving but HAs wanted mandated deadlines for HUD approval and
no continuous review of previous approvals. Field Office oversight of troubled HAs was criticized for lacking in
clear direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CLPHA and the NYCHA recommended that HUD's rules and procedures for CGP should vary much more widely to acknowledge
the differences between modernization programs at HAs of different sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD will take these comments regarding better assistance to program participants into account when it revises the
CGP Handbook. Recently, HUD completed its reorganization of the Field Offices. Regional Offices were eliminated
and revised delegations of authority were provided to the Field Offices. IHAs are advised that technical assistance
is already in place. HUD will make its best efforts to provide timely reviews. However, HUD cannot always respond to
HA requests within 14 days in all cases.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 CLPHA requested that HUD allow HAs much wider latitude in meeting 504 requirements, to take into account the current
configuration of buildings and units and the comparative suitability of individual buildings for 504 modifications.
They also requested that HUD speed up its decisions concerning 504 requirements under modernization and noted that
Field Offices sometimes make unreasonable demands on the HAs, and there is no official HUD guidance in this area.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is unclear what the commenter intended. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a civil rights statute.
The current regulation at 24 CFR part 8 provides HAs with a considerable amount of latitude to take into consideration
current building and site configuration. When an HA undertakes new construction or substantial or other alterations
with respect to a given project, the HA has the authority to determine which are the units, buildings and sites in which
the required number of accessible units will be located. The following are several examples of how the regulation
provides latitude:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Section 8.23(b) of the regulation requires that when ``other alterations'' are undertaken, accessible units be
provided to ``the maximum extent feasible.'' The regulation indicates that this requirement shall not be interpreted
as requiring that an HA make a dwelling unit accessible if doing so would impose an undue financial and administrative
burden on the operation of the development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Section 8.26 requires that units be distributed throughout developments and sites and shall be available in a range
of sizes and amenities. The regulation, however, indicates that this provision shall not be construed to require
the provision of an elevator solely for the purpose of permitting the location of accessible units above or below grade
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Section 8.32 provides that compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) shall be deemed
to comply with the 504 requirements and that departures from UFAS are permitted where substantially equivalent or
greater access to and usability of the building is provided. Since the regulation does not mandate the use of UFAS,
the HA is free to use another standard as long as it is at least equal to or greater than this standard. Further, this part
of the regulation indicates that the HA is not required to make building alterations that have little likelihood of
being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Department believes that HAs do have wide latitude in determining the location of accessible units, it is
important to emphasize that such latitude should not be construed as relieving HAs from the specific requirements
mandated by the statute or regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also is unclear why Field Offices should be slow making decisions concerning 504 requirements. Further,
the Department disagrees that there is ``no guidance'' with respect to 504 requirements. The requirements for compliance
with Section 504 are outlined in 24 CFR part 8 and UFAS. There may be individual unusual or unique situations which require
a more detailed solution in order for particular design to meet these requirements.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One HA found it impossible to accomplish a comprehensive improvement program for a given development because of the
incremental approach resulting from CGP. Developments with needs for major redesign of obsolete systems have inadequate
funds to complete this work. A solution proposed was to eliminate the requirement that prohibits previous use of CIAP
or CGP funds on a development seeking MROP eligibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD is seeking repeal of MROP. There is a statutory prohibition against using modernization funds on a building being
funded with MROP funds. HUD's Office of General Counsel has determined that this prohibition does not last forever.
Accordingly, the Department has determined that a development or a building which has been funded under MROP after
FFY 1988 is eligible for modernization funding if it has reached DOFA. Also, a development or a building which has been
funded under MROP during FFYs 1986&hyph;1988 is eligible for modernization funding if all MROP funds have been expended.

The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule provides revisions to the existing CGP under which HAs receive modernization assistance
from HUD on the basis of a formula. HUD does not anticipate a significant economic impact on small entities since HAs
will continue to carry out their modernization activities by entering into contracts for the work as they now do.

Federalism,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their
political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review
under the order. The revised CGP is consistent with federalism principles since it reduces unnecessary burdens on
HAs. While the program is revised, the primary change is only in the way that HUD processes and reviews HA modernization
activities, and not the modernization activities. Since participation by HAs is discretionary, this rule lacks
the direct and substantial effects on HAs required for a policy with federalism implications under the Order.

or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.
The rule does not have the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, or general well-being,

On February 26, 1990, the Department published an interim rule (24 CFR part 87) advising recipients and subrecipients
of Federal contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and loans of a prohibition mandated by Congress. Section 319
of the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;121, approved October 23, 1989) generally
prohibits recipients of Federal contracts, grants, and loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive
or Legislative branches of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The interim
rule generally prohibits the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient
has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. In addition, the recipient must also file a disclosure
if it has made or has agreed to make any payment with nonappropriated funds that would be prohibited, if paid with appropriated
funds. IHAs established by an Indian Tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded from
coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from the statute's coverage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification and disclosure requirements apply to all grants in excess of $100,000. All potential grantees
are required to submit the certification, and to make the required disclosure if the grant amount exceeds $100,000.
Potential grantees should refer to 24 CFR part 87 for the language for the certification and disclosure. The law provides
substantial monetary penalties for failure to file the required certification or disclosure.

For each FFY, HUD shall reserve from amounts approved in the appropriation act for grants under this part and part 968
of this title, $75 million (which shall include unused reserve amounts carried over from previous FFYs), which shall
be made available to IHAs and PHAs for modernization needs resulting from natural and other disasters, and from emergencies.
HUD shall replenish this reserve at the beginning of each FFY so that it always begins with a $75 million balance. Any
unused funds from previous years will remain in the reserve until allocated. The requirements governing the reserve
for disasters and emergencies and the procedures by which an IHA may request such funds, are set forth in &sect;905.667.

. Eligible modernization work on any Turnkey III units that have been paid-off, but not conveyed, by the time the CIAP
application or CGP Annual Statement is submitted, is limited to work which is necessary to meet statutory requirements
(e.g., accessibility for disabled persons, lead-based paint testing, interim containment, professional risk
assessment and abatement). Such work must be completed prior to conveyance. Turnkey III units that have not been paid-off
at the time the CIAP application or CGP Annual Statement is submitted and for which work is included in the CIAP application
or CGP Annual Statement, are eligible for any physical improvements provided under &sect;905.666(d) even where
the units are subsequently paid-off before the work is completed, so long as the work is completed prior to conveyance.

. An IHA may use CIAP or CGP funds under this subpart for the purposes of modernizing a Mutual Help unit which is paid-off,
but not conveyed, and may do so only with a unit which the IHA has identified in its CIAP application or Comprehensive
Plan (including Five-Year Action Plan and Annual Statement). In accordance with the provisions of &sect;905.440
(e)(8), an IHA may perform non-emergency work on a paid-off Mutual Help unit only after all delinquencies are repaid.

e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, accessibility for disabled persons, lead-based paint testing, interim containment, professional risk assessment,
and abatement) and the correction of development deficiencies. Notwithstanding the above requirement, an IHA may,
with prior HUD approval, complete non-emergency physical improvements on any homeownership unit where the IHA demonstrates
that, due to economies of scale or geographic constraints, substantial cost savings may be realized by completing
all necessary work in a development at one time.

. Eligible costs include alterations, betterments, additions, replacements, and non-routine maintenance that
are necessary to meet the modernization and energy conservation standards prescribed in &sect;905.603. These mandatory
standards may be exceeded only when the IHA determines that it is necessary or highly desirable for the long-term physical
and social viability of the individual development. If demolition or disposition is proposed, the IHA shall comply
with 24 CFR part 905, subpart M. Additional dwelling space may be added to existing units.

for substantial rehabilitation and subsequent sale. In addition, an IHA must demonstrate in its needs assessment
that the IHA has homebuyers who are both eligible for homeownership, in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR
part 905 (Subpart G), and who have demonstrated their intent to be placed into each of the Turnkey III units proposed
to be substantially rehabilitated;

(for IHAs participating in CIAP), from the reserve established under &sect;905.601(b). However, emergency reserve
funds may not be provided to an IHA participating in CGP that has the necessary funds available from any other source,
including its annual formula allocation under &sect;905.601(e) and (f), other unobligated modernization funds,
and its replacement reserves under &sect;905.666. An IHA is not required to have an approved comprehensive plan under
&sect;905.672 before it can request emergency assistance from this reserve. Emergency reserve funds may not be provided
to an IHA participating in CIAP unless it does not have the necessary funds available from any other source, including
unobligated CIAP, and no CIAP modernization funding is available from HUD for the remainder of the fiscal year.

General.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The plan shall include, on a development-by-development basis, an analysis of whether completion of the improvements
and replacements identified under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section will reasonably ensure the long-term
physical and social viability, including achieving structural/system soundness and full occupancy of the development
at a reasonable cost. For cost reasonableness, the IHA may choose to use the 90% of Total Development Cost (TDC) approach
(the preliminary estimate of hard costs for work proposed at the development is 90% or less of TDC) or a cost reasonableness
approach related to the cost of individual work items as indicated by National cost indices, adjusted by local conditions
and the IHA's own recent procurement experience. The IHA shall keep documentation in its files to support its reasonable
cost determinations of each major work item (e.g., kitchen cabinets, exterior doors). HUD will review cost reasonableness
as part of its review of the Annual Submission and the Performance and Evaluation Report. Where necessary, HUD will
review the IHA's documentation in support of its cost reasonableness;

Where an IHA's analysis of a development, under paragraph (d) of this section, establishes that completion of the
identified improvements and replacements will not result in the long-term physical and social viability of the development
at a reasonable cost, the IHA shall not expend CGP funds for the development, except for emergencies and essential
non-routine maintenance necessary to maintain habitability until residents can be relocated. The IHA shall specify
in its Comprehensive Plan the actions it proposes to take with respect to the non-viable development (e.g., demolition
or disposition under 24 CFR part 905, subpart M).

The Comprehensive Plan shall include a rolling Five-Year Action Plan to carry out the improvements and replacements
(or a portion thereof) identified under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. In developing its Five-Year
Action Plan, the IHA shall assume that the current year funding or formula amount will be available for each year of
its Five-Year Action Plan, whichever the IHA is using for planning purposes, plus the IHA's estimate of the funds that
will be available from other sources, such as State, local and tribal governments. All activities specified in an
IHA's Five-Year Action Plan are contingent upon the availability of funds;

After HUD approves the Comprehensive Plan (including the Five-Year Action Plan), or any amendments to the plan, it
shall be binding upon HUD and the IHA, until such time as the IHA submits, and HUD approves, an amendment to its plan.
The IHA is expected to undertake the work set forth in the Annual Statement. However, the IHA may undertake any of the
work identified in any of the other four years of the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan, current approved Annual
Statement or previously approved CIAP budgets, without further HUD approval. Actual uses of the funds are to be reflected
in the IHA annual Performance and Evaluation Report for each grant. See &sect;905.684. The IHA is encouraged to inform
the residents of significant changes (such as changes in scope of work or whenever it moves work items within the approved
Five-Year Action Plan). Documentation of that information shall be retained in IHA files. If HUD determines as a result
of an audit or monitoring findings that an IHA has provided false or substantially inaccurate data in its Comprehensive
Plan/Annual Submission or has circumvented the intent of the program, HUD may condition the receipt of assistance,
in accordance with &sect;950.687. Moreover, in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 1001, any individual or entity who knowingly
and willingly makes or uses a document or writing containing any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry,
in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States, shall be fined not more than
$10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.

The Annual Submission is a collective term for all documents which the IHA must submit to HUD for review and approval
before accessing the current FFY grant funds. Such documents include the Annual Statement, Work Statements for years
two through five of the Five-Year Action Plan, local government statement, IHA Board Resolution, materials demonstrating
the partnership process and any other documents as prescribed by HUD. For planning purposes, an IHA may use either
the amount of funding received in the current year or the actual formula amount provided in HUD's notification under
&sect;905.669(b)(1) in developing the Five-Year Action Plan for presentation at the resident meetings and public
hearing. Work Statements cover the second through the fifth years of the Five-Year Action Plan and set forth the major
work categories and costs by development or IHA-wide which the IHA intends to undertake in each year of years two through
five. In preparing these Work Statements, the IHA shall assume that the current FFY formula amount will be available
in each year of years two through five. The Work Statements for all five years will be at the same level of detail so that
the IHA may interchange work items as discussed in &sect;905.672(d)(5)(i). An IHA may budget up to 8% of its annual
grant in a contingency account for cost overruns.

Resident and local government participation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An IHA is required to develop its Annual Submission, including any proposed amendments to its Comprehensive Plan
as provided in &sect;905.672(e), in consultation with officials of the appropriate governing body (or, in the case
of an IHA with developments in multiple jurisdictions, in consultation with the CEO of each such jurisdiction or with
an advisory group representative of all jurisdictions) and with residents and duly elected resident organizations
of the developments covered by the Comprehensive Plan, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within a reasonable amount of time before the advance meeting for residents under paragraph (d)(2) of this section,
and the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the IHA shall annually provide public notice of the
advance meeting and the public hearing in a manner determined by the IHA and which ensures notice to all duly elected
resident organizations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Advance meeting with residents. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IHA shall at least annually hold a meeting open to all residents and duly elected resident organizations. The advance
meeting shall be held within a reasonable amount of time before the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
The IHA will provide residents with information concerning the contents of the IHA's Five-Year Action Plan (and any
proposed amendments to the IHA's Comprehensive Plan to be submitted with the Annual Submission) so that residents
can comment adequately at the public hearing on the contents of the Five-Year Action Plan and any proposed amendments
to the Comprehensive Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Public hearing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IHA shall annually hold at least one public hearing, and any appropriate number of additional hearings, to present
information on the Annual Submission and the status of prior approved programs. The public hearing shall provide
ample opportunity for residents of the developments covered by the Comprehensive Plan, officials of the appropriate
governing body, and other interested parties, to express their priorities and concerns. The IHA shall give full consideration
to the comments and concerns of residents, local government officials, and other interested parties in developing
its Five-Year Action Plan, or any amendments to its Comprehensive Plan.

Expedited scheduling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
IHAs are encouraged to hold the meeting with residents and duly elected resident organizations under paragraph (d)(2)
of this section, and the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section between July 1 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., after the end of the program year_June 30) and September 30, using the formula amount for the current FFY. If an IHA
elects to use such expedited scheduling, it must explain at the meeting with residents and duly elected resident organizations
and at the public hearing that the current FFY amount is not the actual grant amount for the subsequent year, but is rather
the amount used for planning purposes. It must also explain that the Five-Year Action Plan will be adjusted when HUD
provides notification of the actual formula amount, and explain which major work categories at which developments
may be added or deleted to adjust for the actual formula amount and that any added work categories/developments will
come from the Comprehensive Plan.

The Annual Statement for each year must include, for each development or on an IHA-wide basis for management improvements
or certain physical improvements for which work is to be funded out of that year's grant: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A list of development accounts with an identification of major work categories; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The cost for each major work category, as well as a summary of cost by development account; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The IHA-wide or development-specific management improvements to be undertaken during the year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For each development and for any management improvements not covered by a HUD-approved management improvement
plan, a schedule for the use of current year funds, including target dates for the obligation and expenditure of the
funds. In general, HUD expects that an IHA will obligate its current year's allocation of CGP funds (except for its
funded replacement reserves) within two years, and expend such funds within three years, of the date of HUD approval,
unless longer time-frames are approved by HUD due to the size of the grant, the complexity of the work, and other factors;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A summary description of the actions to be taken with non-CGP funds to meet physical and management improvement
needs which have been identified by the IHA in its needs assessments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

General
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An Annual Submission accepted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall be considered to be approved,
unless HUD notifies the IHA in writing, postmarked within 75 calendar days of the date that HUD receives the Annual
Submission for review under paragraph (c) of this section, that HUD has disapproved the Annual Submission, indicating
the reasons for disapproval, the modifications required to make the Annual Submission approvable, and the date by
which such modifications must be received by HUD. HUD may request additional information (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for eligibility determinations) to facilitate review and approval of the Annual Submission during the 75-day review
period. HUD shall not disapprove an Annual Submission on the basis that the Department cannot complete its review
under this section within the 75-day deadline;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bases for disapproval for Annual Submission. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD shall approve the Annual Submission, except where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plainly inconsistent with Comprehensive Plan. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD determines that the activities and expenditures proposed in the Annual Submission are plainly inconsistent
with the IHA's approved Comprehensive Plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contradiction of IHA resolution. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has evidence which tends to challenge, in a substantial manner, the certifications contained in the board resolution,
as required by &sect;905.672(d)(7).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Amendments to Annual Statement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IHA shall advise HUD of all changes to the IHA's approved Annual Statement in its Performance and Evaluation Report
submitted under &sect;905.684. The IHA shall submit to HUD for prior approval any additional work categories (except
for emergency work) which are not within the IHA's approved Five-Year Action Plan.

Failure to obligate formula funds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the IHA fails to obligate formula funds within the approved or extended time period, the IHA may be subject to an alternative
management strategy which may involve third-party oversight or administration of the modernization function.
HUD would only require such action after a corrective action order had been issued under &sect;905.687 and the IHA
failed to comply with the order. HUD could then require an alternative management strategy in a corrective action
order. An IHA may appeal in writing the corrective action order requiring an alternative management strategy within
30 calendar days of that order. HUD Headquarters shall render a written decision on an IHA's appeal within 30 calendar
days of the date of its receipt of the IHA's appeal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extension of time for performance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An IHA may extend the target dates for fund obligation and expenditure in the approved Annual Statement whenever any
delay outside the IHA's control occurs, as specified by HUD, and the extension is made in a timely manner. Such revision
is subject to HUD review under &sect;905.687(a)(2) as to the IHA's continuing capacity. HUD shall not review as to
an IHA's continuing capacity any revisions to an IHA's Comprehensive Plan and related statements where the basis
for the revision is that HUD has not provided the amount of assistance set forth in the Annual Submission, or has not
provided such assistance in a timely manner.

(i) In making this determination, HUD will review the IHA's performance to determine whether the modernization activities
undertaken during the period under review conform substantially to the activities specified in the approved Five-Year
Action Plan. HUD will also review an IHA's progress against the implementation schedules for purposes of determining
whether the IHA has carried out its modernization activities in a timely manner;

(iii) In determining whether the IHA has made reasonable progress, HUD will take into account the level of funding

and expends such modernization funds within three years of ACC amendment execution, or such longer period if approved
by HUD or extended by the IHA for reasons outside of its control in an implementation schedule. The IHA must demonstrate
to HUD's satisfaction that any lack of timeliness (beyond the time periods specified in this paragraph or date specified
in a HUD approved implementation schedule) has resulted from factors beyond the IHA's control. If the IHA fails to
obligate formula funds within the approved or extended time period, the IHA may be subject to an alternative management
strategy which may involve third-party oversight or administration of the modernization function. HUD would only
require such action after a corrective action order had been issued under this section and the IHA failed to comply
with the order. HUD could then require an alternative management strategy in a correction action order. An IHA may
appeal in writing the corrective action order requiring an alternative management strategy within 30 calendar days
of that order. HUD Headquarters shall render a written decision on an IHA's appeal within 30 calendar days of the date
of its receipt of the IHA's appeal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Modernization work on a Turnkey III unit shall not increase the purchase price or amortization period of the home.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paid-off units.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Eligible modernization work on any Turnkey III units that have been paid-off, but not conveyed, by the time the CIAP
application or CGP Annual Statement is submitted, is limited to work which is necessary to meet statutory requirements
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 accessibility for disabled persons, lead-based paint testing, interim containment, professional risk assessment
and abatement). Such work must be completed prior to conveyance. Turnkey III units that have not been paid-off at the
time the CIAP application or CGP Annual Statement is submitted and for which work is included in the CIAP application
or CGP Annual Statement, are eligible for any physical improvements provided under &sect;968.310(d) even where
the units are subsequently paid-off before the work is completed, so long as the work is completed prior to conveyance.

Other.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The homebuyer family must be in compliance with its financial obligations under its homebuyer agreement in order
to be eligible for non-emergency physical improvements, with the exception of work necessary to meet statutory and
regulatory requirements, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 accessibility for disabled persons, lead-based paint testing, interim containment, professional risk assessment,
and abatement) and the correction of development deficiencies. Notwithstanding the above requirement, a PHA may,
with prior HUD approval, complete non-emergency physical improvements on any homeownership unit where the PHA demonstrates
that, due to economies of scale or geographic constraints, substantial cost savings may be realized by completing
all necessary work in a development at one time.

of this title, $75 million (which shall include unused reserve amounts carried over from previous FFYs), which shall
be made available to PHAs and IHAs for modernization needs resulting from natural and other disasters, and from emergencies.
HUD shall replenish this reserve at the beginning of each FFY so that it always begins with a $75 million balance. Any
unused funds from previous years will remain in the reserve until allocated. The requirements governing the reserve
for disasters and emergencies and the procedures by which a PHA may request such funds, are set forth in &sect;968.312.

. A PHA (including a PHA that has been designated as mod troubled under PHMAP) may obtain funds at any time, for any eligible
emergency work item as defined in &sect;968.305 (for PHAs participating in CGP) or for any eligible emergency work
item (described as emergency modernization in &sect;968.205) (for PHAs participating in CIAP), from the reserve
established under &sect;968.103(b). However, emergency reserve funds may not be provided to a PHA participating
in CGP that has the necessary funds available from any other source, including its annual formula allocation under
&sect;968.103 (e) and (f), other unobligated modernization funds, and its replacement reserves under &sect;968.310(a)(3).
A PHA is not required to have an approved comprehensive plan under &sect;968.320 before it can request emergency assistance
from this reserve. Emergency reserve funds may not be provided to a PHA participating in CIAP unless it does not have
the necessary funds available from any other source, including unobligated CIAP, and no CIAP modernization funding
is available from HUD for the remainder of the fiscal year.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The plan shall include, on a development-by-development basis, an analysis of whether completion of the improvements
and replacements identified under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section will reasonably ensure the long-term
physical and social viability, including achieving structural/system soundness and full occupancy, of the development
at a reasonable cost. For cost reasonableness, the PHA may choose to use the 90% of Total Development Cost (TDC) approach
(the preliminary estimate of hard costs for work proposed at the development is 90% or less of TDC) or a cost reasonableness
approach related to the cost of individual work items as indicated by National cost indices, adjusted by local conditions
and the PHA's own recent procurement experience. The PHA shall keep documentation in its files to support its reasonable
cost determinations of each major work item (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, kitchen cabinets, exterior doors). HUD will review cost reasonableness as part of its review of the Annual Submission
and the Performance and Evaluation Report. Where necessary, HUD will review the PHA's documentation in support of
its cost reasonableness;

 Where a PHA's analysis of a development, under paragraph (d) of this section, establishes that completion of the identified
improvements and replacements will not result in the long-term physical and social viability of the development
at a reasonable cost, the PHA shall not expend CGP funds for the development, except for emergencies and essential
non-routine maintenance necessary to maintain habitability until residents can be relocated. The PHA shall specify
in its Comprehensive Plan the actions it proposes to take with respect to the non-viable development (

its Five-Year Action Plan, whichever the PHA is using for planning purposes, plus the PHA's estimate of the funds that
will be available from other sources, such as State and local governments. All activities specified in an PHA's Five-Year

 After HUD approves the Comprehensive Plan (including the Five-Year Action Plan), or any amendments to the plan, it
shall be binding upon HUD and the PHA, until such time as the PHA submits, and HUD approves, an amendment to its plan.
The PHA is expected to undertake the work set forth in the Annual Statement. However, the PHA may undertake any of the
work identified in any of the other four years of the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan, current approved Annual
Statement or previously approved CIAP budgets, without further HUD approval. Actual uses of the funds are to be reflected
in the PHA annual Performance and Evaluation Report for each grant. See &sect;968.340. The PHA is encouraged to inform
the residents of significant changes (such as changes in scope of work or whenever it moves items within the approved
Five-Year Action Plan). Documentation of that information shall be retained in PHA files. If HUD determines as a result
of an audit or monitoring findings that a PHA has provided false or substantially inaccurate data in its Comprehensive
Plan/Annual Submission or has circumvented the intent of the program, HUD may condition the receipt of assistance,
in accordance with &sect;968.345. Moreover, in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 1001, any individual or entity who knowingly
and willingly makes or uses a document or writing containing any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry,
in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States, shall be fined not more than
$10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Annual Submission is a collective term for all documents which the PHA must submit to HUD for review and approval
before accessing the current FFY grant funds. Such documents include the Annual Statement, Work Statements for years
two through five of the Five-Year Action Plan, local government statement, PHA Board Resolution, materials demonstrating
the partnership process and any other documents as prescribed by HUD. For planning purposes, a PHA may use either the
amount of funding received in the current year or the actual formula amount provided in HUD's notification under &sect;968.315(b)(1)
in developing the Five-Year Action Plan for presentation at the resident meetings and public hearing. Work Statements
cover the second through the fifth years of the Five-Year Action Plan and set forth the major work categories and costs
by development or PHA-wide which the PHA intends to undertake in each year of years two through five. In preparing these
Work Statements, the PHA shall assume that the current FFY formula amount will be available in each year of years two
through five. The Work Statements for all five years will be at the same level of detail so that the PHA may interchange
work items as discussed in &sect;968.320(d)(5)(i). A PHA may budget up to 8% of its annual grant in a contingency account
for cost overruns.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After receiving HUD notification of the formula amount and estimating how much funding will be available from other
sources, such as State and local governments, and determining its activities and costs based on the current FFY formula
amount, the PHA shall submit its Annual Submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Acceptance for review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Upon receipt of an Annual Submission from a PHA, HUD shall determine whether:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Annual Submission contains each of the required components; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The PHA has submitted any additional information or assurances required as a result of HUD monitoring, findings
of inadequate PHA performance, audit findings, and civil rights compliance findings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the PHA has submitted a complete Annual Submission and all required information and assurances, HUD will accept
the submission for review, as of the date of receipt. If the PHA has not submitted all required material, HUD will promptly
notify the PHA that it has disapproved the submission, indicating the reasons for disapproval, the modifications
required to qualify the Annual Submission for HUD review, and the date by which such modifications must be received
by HUD.

Resident and local government participation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A PHA is required to develop its Annual Submission, including any proposed amendments to its Comprehensive Plan as
provided in &sect;968.320 (b) and (c), in consultation with officials of the appropriate governing body (or, in the
case of a PHA with developments in multiple jurisdictions, in consultation with the CEO of each such jurisdiction
or with an advisory group representative of all jurisdictions) and with residents and duly elected resident councils
of the developments covered by the Comprehensive Plan, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Within a reasonable amount of time before the advance meeting for residents under paragraph (d)(2) of this section,
and the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the PHA shall annually provide public notice of the
advance meeting and the public hearing in a manner determined by the PHA and which ensures notice to all duly elected
resident councils;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Advance Meeting with residents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PHA shall at least annually hold a meeting open to all residents and duly elected resident councils. The advance
meeting shall be held within a reasonable amount of time before the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
The PHA will provide residents with information concerning the contents of the PHA's Five-Year Action Plan (and any
proposed amendments to the PHA's Comprehensive Plan to be submitted with the Annual Submission) so that residents
can comment adequately at the public hearing on the contents of the Five-Year Action Plan and any proposed amendments
to the Comprehensive Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public hearing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PHA shall annually hold at least one public hearing, and any appropriate number of additional hearings, to present
information on the Annual Submission and the status of prior approved programs. The public hearing shall provide
ample opportunity for residents of the developments covered by the Comprehensive Plan, officials of the appropriate
governing body, and other interested parties, to express their priorities and concerns. The PHA shall give full consideration
to the comments and concerns of residents, local government officials, and other interested parties in developing
its Five-Year Action Plan, or any amendments to its Comprehensive Plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Expedited scheduling.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PHAs are encouraged to hold the meeting with residents and duly elected resident councils under paragraph (d)(2)
of this section, and the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section between July 1 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 after the end of the program year_June 30) and September 30, using the formula amount for the current FFY. If a PHA elects
to use such expedited scheduling, it must explain at the meeting with residents and duly elected resident councils
and at the public hearing that the current FFY amount is not the actual grant amount for the subsequent year, but is rather
the amount used for planning purposes. It must also explain that the Five-Year Action Plan will be adjusted when HUD
provides notification of the actual formula amount, and explain which major work categories at which developments
may be added or deleted to adjust for the actual formula amount and that any added work categories/developments will
come from the Comprehensive Plan.

(4) For each development and for any management improvements not covered by a HUD-approved MOA or management improvement
plan, a schedule for the use of current year funds, including target dates for the obligation and expenditure of the
funds. In general, HUD expects that a PHA will obligate its current year's allocation of CGP funds (except for its funded
replacement reserves) within two years, and expend such funds within three years, of the date of HUD approval, unless
longer time-frames are approved by HUD due to the size of the grant, the complexity of the work, and other factors;

Submission for review under paragraph (c) of this section, that HUD has disapproved the Annual Submission, indicating
the reasons for disapproval, the modifications required to make the Annual Submission approvable, and the date by
which such modifications must be received by HUD. HUD may request additional information (e.g., for eligibility
determinations) to facilitate review and approval of the Annual Submission during the 75-day review period. HUD
shall not disapprove an Annual Submission on the basis that the Department cannot complete its review under this section
within the 75-day deadline;

The PHA shall advise HUD of all changes to the PHA's approved Annual Statement in its Performance and Evaluation Report
submitted under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;968.305. The PHA shall submit to HUD for prior approval any additional work categories (except for emergency
work) which are not within the PHA's approved Five-Year Action Plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Failure to obligate formula funds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the PHA fails to obligate formula funds within the approved or extended time period, the PHA may be subject to an alternative
management strategy which may involve third-party oversight or administration of the modernization function.
HUD would only require such action after a corrective action order had been issued under &sect;968.345 and the PHA
failed to comply with the order. HUD could then require an alternative management strategy in a corrective action
order. A PHA may appeal in writing the corrective action order requiring an alternative management strategy within
30 calendar days of that order. HUD Headquarters shall render a written decision on a PHA's appeal within 30 calendar
days of the date of its receipt of the PHA's appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extension of time for performance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A PHA may extend the target dates for fund obligation and expenditure in the approved Annual Statement whenever any
delay outside the PHA's control occurs, as specified by HUD, and the extension is made in a timely manner. Such revision
is subject to HUD review under &sect;968.345(a)(2) as to the PHA's continuing capacity. HUD shall not review as to
a PHA's continuing capacity any revisions to a PHA's Comprehensive Plan and related statements where the basis for
the revision is that HUD has not provided the amount of assistance set forth in the Annual Submission, or has not provided
such assistance in a timely manner.

ACC Amendment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After HUD approval of each year's Annual Submission, HUD and the PHA shall enter into an ACC amendment to obtain modernization
funds. The ACC amendment shall require low-income use of housing for not less than 20 years from the date of the ACC amendment
(subject to sale of homeownership units in accordance with the terms of the ACC).

As HUD may require, the PHA shall execute and file for record a Declaration of Trust as provided under the ACC to protect
the rights and interests of HUD throughout the 20-year period during which the PHA is obligated to operate its developments
in accordance with the ACC, the Act, and HUD regulations and requirements.

(i) In making this determination, HUD will review the PHA's performance to determine whether the modernization activities
undertaken during the period under review conform substantially to the activities specified in the approved Five-Year
Action Plan. HUD will also review a PHA's progress against the implementation schedules for purposes of determining
whether the PHA has carried out its modernization activities in a timely manner; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) HUD will review a PHA's performance to determine whether the activities carried out comply with the requirements
of the Act, including the requirement that work carried out meets the modernization and energy conservation standards
in &sect;968.115, this part, and other applicable laws and regulations. This review should also include a review
of the PHA's section 3 (of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968) past performance.

by HUD or extended by the PHA for reasons outside of its control in an implementation schedule. The PHA must demonstrate
to HUD's satisfaction that any lack of timeliness (beyond the time periods specified in this paragraph or date specified
in a HUD approved implementation schedule) has resulted from factors beyond the PHA's control. If the PHA fails to
obligate formula funds within the approved or extended time period, the PHA may be subject to an alternative management
strategy which may involve third-party oversight or administration of the modernization function. HUD would only
require such action after a corrective action order had been issued under this section and the PHA failed to comply
with the order. HUD could then require an alternative management strategy in a corrective action order. A PHA may appeal
in writing the corrective action order requiring an alternative management strategy within 30 calendar days of that
order. HUD Headquarters shall render a written decision on a PHA's appeal within 30 calendar days of the date of its
receipt of the PHA's appeal.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule implements provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Act) that require a $25
location fee and a $100 annual maintenance fee for each mining claim and site located and held under the general mining
laws. The fee requirements remain in effect through 1998, and apply to the assessment years 1994&hyph;95 through
1998&hyph;99. The final rule establishes the procedures for paying and administering the required annual maintenance
and location fees, puts into regulation the statute's mandatory payment deadlines and its mandatory provision that
failure to pay the fees on time constitutes abandonment of the claim or site, amends the recording and assessment work
regulations to conform to the requirements of the Act, and establishes procedures by which small miners may obtain
a waiver from payment of the maintenance fee. The final rule also implements the new location and recording requirements
for mining claims located on Stockraising Homestead Act lands. These requirements are contained in the Act of April
16, 1993 (107 Stat. 60). It also removes obsolete or expired provisions, and consolidates provisions that are still
in force and effect in the regulations concerning location and entry of mining claims and sites on coal bearing lands,
National Park System units, the King Range Conservation Area, and Indian reservations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposed rule amending certain sections of the regulations at 43 CFR parts 3720, 3730, 3800, 3810, 3820, 3830, and
3850 was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24572). There were 25 comments received regarding the proposal. Six comments were received from
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) State Offices, 4 comments were received from private attorneys, 3 comments were received
from individuals not connected with the mining industry, 3 comments were received from mining claimants, 3 comments
were received from mining industry organizations, 1 comment was received from an individual in a mining-related
business, 1 comment was received from a county government, 1 comment was received from an environmental group, 1 comment
was received from a mining company, 1 comment was received from a Forest Service employee, and 1 comment was received
from an individual BLM employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d), for good cause finds that it would not be in the public
interest to delay the effective date until 30 days after publication. The deadline for payment of the annual maintenance
fee is August 31, 1994. The mining industry needs as much time as possible to comply with the rule, and the BLM State Offices
will not be able to accept filing and payments, or to assist the public in other ways, until the rule is effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule contained several references to the Act of October 5, 1992, which established the mining claim rental
fee that has been in effect since the date of its enactment and which will expire on September 30, 1994. For the sake of
simplicity, and because (1) The maintenance fee essentially replaces the original rental fee, (2) the rental fee
statute will expire on September 30, and (3) any remaining issues regarding the rental fee can be dealt with using the
regulations that implemented the October 5, 1992, Act, which were codified in the 1993 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR), all references to the 1992 Act have been removed from this final rule, including references to rental fees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments addressed all aspects of the proposed rule. They were all given careful consideration and are addressed
in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether the $10 service charge for recording notices of location was being eliminated. The answer
is no, because it is required for cost recovery purposes. The service charge requirement is retained in &sect;3833.1&hyph;4(a).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment expressed uncertainty as to when the new maintenance fee was to be effective. The maintenance fee for existing
claims is first due to be filed on or before August 31, 1994, to hold the claim for the 1994&hyph;1995 assessment year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the maintenance fee should not be subject to increases tied to the consumer price index and
that such increases would put the fee out of sight for small miners. The comment further stated that these increases
should not apply to those holding 10 or fewer claims. The provision to adjust maintenance fees to reflect changes in
the consumer price index is statutory and cannot be changed in this rule. However, it would not affect small miners
who file a valid waiver certification statement. Such individuals would not have to pay the maintenance fee, but would
continue to perform $100 worth of assessment work as required by the Mining Law of 1872. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that this rule and other unspecified changes in the Mining Law were being done without congressional
authorization and are putting the mining industry out of business. The rule is being promulgated and is explicitly
required by Section 10106 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (107 Stat. 407), as enacted by Congress.
Despite the reduction in active mining claims on Federal lands since $100 fees were first required in the 1992&hyph;93
assessment year, there is no substantial evidence to suggest that the fee is driving the bona fide mining industry
out of business.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment objected to the short notice given in the proposed rule on May 11, 1994, that assessment work to hold the
claim for those claimants qualifying as small miners for the assessment year beginning on September 1, 1994, must
be completed in the assessment year ending on that date. However, enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act on August 10, 1993, predated the beginning of the assessment year ending on September 1, 1994, and served as ample
notice for those claimants seeking to qualify as small miners under the new legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment objected to any change in the Mining Law. Since the Congress has amended the Mining Law to require a maintenance
fee, no changes in the rule are warranted as a result of this comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments stated that references to the due date for payment of the initial maintenance fee, which is made at recordation
of the notice of location and within 90 days after location, were ambiguous. The comment identified the problem as
a possible conflict between the location date on the notice of location and the location date under State law. However,
pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 28, the date of the location of the mining claim is fixed under State law, and that is the date used
by BLM to determine the 90-day period under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) (43 U.S.C. 1701

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment from a county government stated that the removal of the requirement to file assessment work with BLM for
those who pay the maintenance fee will cause the same problems as those that occurred under the rental fee requirements
imposed by the Interior Department and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1993. The comment stated that because
the Federal requirement to record annual labor with BLM had been lifted, filings were not being made with county recorders,
affecting the record title history as well as State tax collections. Filings may still be required under State law.
If State law does not require filing with county recorders, then State law could be amended to remedy the problem. Also,
miners may risk losing their claims to third parties if they do not record with county recorders, and are urged to comply
with State and Federal mining laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that there was some confusion with the term ``record'' as used in the proposed rule. The comment
said that the term should be defined to apply only to county recordings and never to BLM ``filings.'' The term ``record''
has been used to refer to certain BLM filings for many years. Any reference to BLM recordation in the regulations clearly
refers only to BLM requirements for filings in the proper BLM office. It is inappropriate to provide for exclusive
application of the term to county recordings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that a notarized signature from each owner on a new notice of location should be required for State
and Federal tax purposes. The addition of this requirement would be of no value to BLM, because BLM is not the official
repository of mining claim ownership records. The States should ensure that their laws are adequate to trace ownership
for tax purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the rule should require a notice of intention to hold to be filed in the local State jurisdiction
in certain circumstances. No such requirements can be added to this rule, because the 1993 Act does not impose a filing
requirement equivalent to the filing requirements in Section 314 of FLPMA. It is therefore up to the States to impose
such requirements as long as the 1993 Act remains in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the rule should require that relinquishments contain notarized signatures of every owner
in order to protect all owners from having their interests voided without their consent. This is not necessary because
relinquishments relate only to the claimant making the relinquishment, and only his or her interest would be dropped,
not the interests of other claimants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that it is unclear who is required to submit changes of address to BLM and pay the service charges.
It is the owner's responsibility, not a lessee's. The owner is also referred to as the mining claimant. A transferee
could also be an owner or a claimant. However, while BLM does not adjudicate who pays the fee for a mining claim, it holds
the mining claimant responsible if the fee is not paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether the purpose for filing changes of address as requested in the rule is to help ensure that claimants
receive proper notice regarding their claims. The answer is yes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked why the rental fee is now called the maintenance fee. The October 1992 statute used the term rental
fee, and the August 1993 statute used the term maintenance fee. The second term more accurately reflects the nature
of the fee, since it is not considered rent, a service charge, or a tax. It is a payment required to maintain the mining
claim in good standing.

43 CFR 3833.0&hyph;3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that it would not be proper to file a notice of intention to hold a mining claim pursuant to &sect;3833.0&hyph;3(a)
if a waiver is filed. This is true. The waiver for a mining claim can only be allowed if assessment work is done. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested a rewording of paragraph (g)(1)(i) for clarity. This modification has been made to make it clear
that it is the mining claimant who files the notice of intent to locate a claim.

One comment stated that paragraph (e), the definition of ``owner or claimant,'' should not require the name and address
of all owners on documents referred to in the subpart, but should only require the filer's name and address. This requirement
exists largely to protect each claimant's interest in being served in the event of an appeal or other need for communication.
Therefore, it will be retained.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments asked whether paragraph (m), the definition of ``file'' or ``filed,'' was intended to allow notices
of location or certificates of location to be subject to the postmark rule. The answer is yes, and the paragraph has
been further amended in the final rule to make it clear that, in addition, location notices and certificates of location
also will be accepted if postmarked by the end of the 90-day filing period. In response to a comment, the paragraph now
refers to the filing of a maintenance fee waiver certification statement rather than the filing of a maintenance fee
waiver: the former is a more accurate term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (m) was intended to allow $100 fee and waiver filings to be accepted if postmarked
by August 31 and received in the proper BLM office within 15 days of that date. The answer is yes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments said that new location notices should not be subject to the postmark rule pursuant to paragraph (m). All
other filings are similarly subject to the postmark rule. The comments give no reason for location notices to be treated
differently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment questioned whether BLM has the authority to extend the postmark rule to filings under the Act of August
10, 1993, since the Act specifically states that annual fee filings must be made by each August 31. The best precedent
for this is the longstanding administrative practice for annual filings under Section 314(a) of FLPMA. Section 314(a)
states that annual filings shall be made prior to December 31 yearly. However, the postmark rule has been applied to
these filings for years by regulation as a practical way of treating such filings received through the postal system,
and it has been upheld by the Interior Board of Land Appeals. The same practical consideration applies here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (m) is in conflict with &sect;1821.2&hyph;2(f), which does not recognize the
postmark rule except in certain instances. Section 1821.2&hyph;2(f) applies to the filing of applications only,
and paragraph (m) applies to filing notices of locations and payment of fees. No conflict exists between the two sections.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that paragraph (m) meant that if a claimant's maintenance fee filing was postmarked on August 16
or before that the claims would be forfeited. This is not true. The filing can be postmarked any time on or before August
31, as long as it is received in the proper BLM office no later than 15 days after August 31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (m) was meant to allow postmarks that fall on holidays and weekends. Deadlines
that fall on a day the BLM office is closed are carried over to the next working day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (m) was restricted to mailings postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service. This paragraph
has been amended to include other mail delivery systems that are independent of the claimant and for which the date
of filing with the system can be verified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (o)(1) is amended to state clearly that the FLPMA filing due on December 30, 1999, is the last FLPMA filing
affected by the Act of August 10, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (o)(2) is removed in the final rule because it duplicates &sect;3833.1&hyph;7(d). A comment received
concerning the wording of this paragraph is therefore moot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (o)(3) is removed because it duplicates &sect;3833.1&hyph;5(b) as it is revised in this final rule. Thus,
the concerns raised in two comments that referred to the conflicting wording of these sections have been addressed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the removal of paragraphs (o) (2) and (3), paragraph (o)(1) is merged into the introductory text of paragraph
(o). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (w) has been simplified to remove information provided elsewhere in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (bb) and (cc) are amended to reference &sect;3833.1&hyph;1, which is the final rule redesignation of
&sect;3833.1&hyph;8 of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that paragraph (cc) should provide that refunds of payments made by credit card will be made
as a credit to the card account. This suggestion has been adopted in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

43 CFR 3833.1&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although it was not addressed in the proposed rule, the existing language of this section is removed in its entirety
and replaced with &sect;3833.1&hyph;8 of the proposed rule. The old section is being removed administratively in
this final rule because it deals with obsolete requirements. Because this amendment is an administrative action
to remove obsolete provisions, it has been determined that it has no impacts on the public. The Department of the Interior,
therefore, for good cause finds under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3) that notice and public procedure thereon are
unnecessary and that this amendment may take effect upon publication.

In the proposed rule published on May 11, 1994, a paragraph (c) was added to &sect;3833.1&hyph;2 to establish a basic
process for compliance with Public Law 103&hyph;23 of April 16, 1993. This Act (107 Stat. 60) amended the Stockraising
Homestead Act of 1916 (43 U.S.C. 299) by establishing new mining claim location and surface operations requirements
for lands patented under the Stockraising Homestead with a reservation of the mineral estate to the United States.
The Act became effective on October 13, 1993. To implement the Act of April 16, 1993, the Department has begun formulating
regulations on locating claims and obtaining permission for exploration and mining on lands patented under the Stockraising
Homestead Act. These regulations will be proposed as additions to 43 CFR subpart 3814. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Departmental review demonstrates a need to have a basic location, recording, and notification procedure put into
place as soon as possible in order to avoid legal problems between surface owners, mining claimants, and the Department
over rights of location and entry on Stockraising Homestead lands under the Act of April 16, 1993. Therefore, as a logical
outgrowth of the language included in the proposed rule, a new paragraph (d) is added to section 3833.1&hyph;2 to explain
more fully the basic procedural requirements for locating and entering mining claims on Stockraising Homestead
Act lands. This language reiterates, to a large degree, the language of the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested that paragraph (c)(3) of the proposed rule be reworded for clarity. The final rule has been amended
to make it clear that mining claims located on lands patented under the Stockraising Homestead Act, as amended, will
not be recorded unless the claimant complies with the requirements in &sect;3833.1&hyph;2.

Paragraph (c)(3) has been removed because the information appears elsewhere in the section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments said that &sect;3833.1&hyph;3 was confusing. The statute establishes payment deadlines for some types
of fees, but allows payment deficiencies in other types of fee situations to be curable. The comments suggested that
this section be made uniformly curable or non-curable to promote ease of administration. This section was developed
in an effort to strike a balance among ease of administration, public service, and consistency with the law. Because
of the statutory nature of the maintenance fee, it is not possible to make nonpayment of that fee curable. The fact that
this deadline is firm is not an adequate basis for making other fee payment deficiencies non-curable.

One comment said that &sect;3833.1&hyph;3 ought to allow the claimant a chance to choose which mining claims should
have partial payments applied to them before BLM imposes its system for making this determination. This amendment
has been added in this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that the proposed rule was not clear about the treatment of insufficient maintenance fees paid for
new locations. The requirements for this situation are explained in paragraph (b)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that a phrase in paragraph (b)(2), which provides that new claims rejected for insufficient service
charges will be returned to the claimant/owner unprocessed, should be replaced by language requiring that a rejection
decision be sent after the claims are serialized (given BLM identification numbers). Claims for which service charges
have not been paid cannot be serialized because the missing or insufficient service charges are supposed to pay for
such processing. Therefore, absent service charges, there is no serialization, and thus no claims of record, and
there cannot be a formal decision on the disposition of the claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (b)(2) is too complicated and suggested that missing service charges be made a non-curable
defect. Making this change would not remove any administrative costs and would create the possibility of rigid and
unfair application. For instance, a claimant could file $250 to cover two claims, rather than the proper $270 (which
includes two $10 service charges, two $100 maintenance fees, and two $25 location fees). Under the scenario envisioned
in the comment, BLM would have to apply $135 to one claim and then have the expense of refunding $115 and returning the
second claim or writing a decision if the maintenance fee deadline had passed. The BLM prefers to apply the $250 to each
claim ($125 each), and call for the additional $20 in service charges to complete the recording process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to a comment, paragraph (b)(2) has been reworded to eliminate confusion as to which of two apparent deadlines
for paying a service charge applies. New paragraph (b)(3) has been added in the final rule to address the consequences
of partial payment of service charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked that the policy on treatment of payment of insufficient mandatory fees be clarified. (The comment
referred to the required $100 maintenance and $25 location fees.) This policy will not be put in the rule, but will be
included in the BLM Manual. When the payment submitted does not cover all of the fees due, the BLM will apply all fees
sequentially beginning with the first numbered claim of that claimant and to as many thereafter as the paid funds allow.
For instance, if a claimant submits $200 for two new locations, BLM would not consider this complete payment of maintenance
fees for two claims, leaving the location fees and service charges unpaid for both, but would apply the payment entirely
to the first claim before applying any money to the second. Thus, BLM would apply $125 ($100 for the maintenance fee
and $25 for the location fee) initially toward the first claim. Because the remaining $75 would be insufficient to
cover the mandatory fees on the second claim, the second claim would be voided for failure to pay the required fees.
A portion of the remaining funds would then be applied toward the first claim for the $10 service charge. If the claimant
submits other instructions on how to apply the fees, such instructions will be followed, if possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (c)(2) meant to allow a claimant to choose which claims or sites will be dropped
if the maintenance fee payment is not sufficient for all of their claims. The answer is yes. However, if the claimant
does not notify BLM of the preference, then BLM will apply the fees to those claims in ascending numerical order of serialization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested that cross references to &sect;&sect;3833.1&hyph;4 and 3833.1&hyph;5, provisions on service
charges and maintenance fees, be added in paragraph (c)(2). This did not seem necessary, in part due to the physical
proximity of the provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (c)(3) should be changed to remove the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* existing recorded
and serialized mining claims and sites*&blank;*&blank;*'' and to substitute the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* the
list of claims submitted by the claimant *&blank;*&blank;*.'' This change has not been made, but rather, the paragraph
has been removed from the final rule because it largely repeats provisions of paragraph (c)(2).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that the reference in paragraph (f) to facsimile authorizations may cause problems, because some
have been misdirected in the past. A misdirected facsimile would not be considered a filing in the proper office; no
filing or payment is complete or proper until it is received in the appropriate office.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The introduction to this section has been simplified to remove information that is provided elsewhere in the regulations.
The sentence referring to the application of paid rental fees to the maintenance fee was removed, because it confused
the two fees and erroneously applied the succeeding statutes. There is no possibility under either statute that the
rental fees covering 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 could be applied to the maintenance fees covering assessment
years beginning with 1994&hyph;95. Also, the reference to &sect;3833.1&hyph;8 has been changed to &sect;3833.1&hyph;1
because of a redesignation in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(2)(i) is removed in the final rule because it contains information provided elsewhere in the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments questioned whether it was correct to say that the assessment years covered under the Act of August 10,
1993, end on September 1, 1999. It is correct because a maintenance fee paid on or before August 31, 1998, will hold the
claim through September 1, 1999. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment questioned whether this section allows claimants to have more than 10 claims waived. The answer is no.
The language clearly refers to &sect;3833.1&hyph;6, which explains that the waiver can apply only to those with 10
claims or fewer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that the reference in the first sentence of this section to &sect;3833.1&hyph;8 in the proposed rule
was incorrect because &sect;3833.1&hyph;8 did not make an exception from payment of the maintenance fee. This first
sentence refers to &sect;3833.1&hyph;8 in the proposed rule, redesignated as &sect;3833.1&hyph;1 in the final
rule, because the section referred to provides for refunds in certain cases. Therefore, the reference is necessary
because it shows that the maintenance fee is not always nonrefundable, not because the section referred to provides
for some exception to the payment requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether maintenance fees can be paid for years in the future despite the fact that assessment work
always has had to be performed annually. The answer is yes because the maintenance fee has only to be paid on or before
the August 31 deadlines, so that a claimant could pay $500 to hold a claim through September 1999. In the event, however,
that the fee is adjusted pursuant to Section 10105(c) of the Act, reconciliation payments or refunds may be necessary.
Assessment work requirements for small miners remain the same. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that paragraph (a)(1) was unclear in its reference to the ``time of recording.'' The final rule
has been amended to make it clear that this refers to filing with BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that it was incorrect for paragraph (a)(2) to allow no waiver for the initial claim maintenance fee
due upon recordation of a new claim. The small miner waiver is a discretionary waiver. A waiver of the initial maintenance
fee for small miners would be unnecessarily difficult to administer and impossible to apply equally to all miners.
Varying filing requirements arise when miners perform assessment work at different times during the assessment
year, and, in some instances, new locations could change the status of some small miners. As a matter of discretion,
therefore, BLM will not allow a waiver for the initial maintenance fee required upon location of a new claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments stated that paragraph (a)(1) does not account for the situation where the August 31 filing deadline
falls within a new location's 90-day recording period. Language similar to that in the rental fee regulations has
been added in paragraph (a) to cover this situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested that a requirement be added to paragraph (b) in which the claimant would indicate for which year
a submitted maintenance fee is intended. This extra requirement was not added because in almost all cases it will be
apparent which year the fee is intended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (g) should be removed because a small miner who transfers a claim has complied with
the Act, but would have to sell the claim for $100 less to a non-small miner transferee. The comment stated that this
would effectively take away the small miner's waiver. Such a result in claim transfer negotiations is not certain.
In addition, this provision cannot be changed because the statute is very explicit that a claimant who has more than
10 claims is required to pay the fee. The purchase price that is negotiated could be any amount decided by the two parties
and by no means has to reflect the maintenance fee to be paid by the non-small miner transferee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments addressing paragraph (g) asked what would happen if only a percentage of the interest in a claim subject
to a waiver, rather than the whole interest, was transferred to a party not entitled to a waiver. Because a response
to this question depends on whether the parties are related, a general answer cannot be given here. However, the paragraph
is amended to add the phrase ``or in part.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments asked what would happen if, unlike the situation described in paragraph (g), a waived mining claim was
transferred to someone who qualified for a waiver. In such a case the claim would be waived as long as the new owner still
qualified for the waiver with the addition of the new claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the reference in paragraph (g) to the ``time of filing'' the transfer of interest should be
changed to the effective date under State law. This is correct and the amendment has been made in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that paragraph (g) should not allow payments after the applicable August 31 deadline in cases where
claims are transferred to an entity not entitled to a waiver, because there is no statutory authority for such extensions.
This is correct and the final rule has been amended accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (h) will cause claimants who had already paid under the old rate to have to make
additional partial payments. For purposes of clarification, paragraph (h)(2) has been amended in the final rule
to eliminate the possibility of second payments being required in any given year as a result of an increase. If payments
are made in advance of the year in which the fee is due, additional partial payments would be required if the fee is adjusted
upward for that year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the public notice provided for in paragraph (h)(1) should be done by letter to each individual
miner. No decision has been made on how public notice under this paragraph will be accomplished, but it will be within
the guidelines of the Administrative Procedure Act, which controls all such methods of official notification, and
applicable case law.

One comment asked whether a possible upward adjustment of the maintenance fee per paragraph (h)(2) would mean that
the small miner would have to do assessment work of an increased value as well. The answer is no. The amount of assessment
work to be performed is established in the Mining Law of 1872. The maintenance fee is in lieu of assessment work required,
the value of which has not been amended. No further clarification is necessary in the regulations on this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment questioned some of the references in paragraph (i). This paragraph has been removed in the final rule,
because its contents are stated elsewhere in &sect;&sect;3833.1&hyph;5 and 3833.1&hyph;6.

Paragraph (a)(1) was amended to make it clear that for purposes of obtaining the small miner waiver, the claimant is
required to certify that he or she owns 10 claims or fewer on the date payment is due, which is August 31 of each year the
Act of August 10, 1993, remains in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments challenged this section of the proposed rule, correctly observing that the Secretary is not required
to offer a small miner waiver under the Act of August 10, 1993. One comment stated that the Secretary also had the choice
of not offering the waiver or offering some other kind, such as a one-claim waiver. The comment went on to ask about the
analysis that went into the decision to offer the 10-claim waiver and pointed out the administrative costs and loss
of revenue to the government in offering it (the other comment was also concerned with administrative costs). It further
asked what percentage of claims of record are owned by those with 10 or fewer claims. It also said that the National Performance
Review requested by the President states that the Government should get a fair return for Federal resources and the
waiver runs counter to this idea. There is nothing to suggest that Congress intended anything other than for the Secretary
to decide whether to offer the 10-claim waiver as outlined in the Act, or not to offer it at all. The statute allows the
Secretary discretion to offer the waiver to small miners, but defines small miners very specifically. Also, the Act
essentially extends the previous rental fee statute, which offered a similar 10-claim exemption. Therefore, no
other types of waivers such as a one-claim waiver were considered. The choice to offer the 10-claim waiver was made
primarily because the fact that Congress included the waiver in the legislation, although within the Secretary's
discretion, and included specific criteria for implementing it, suggests that Congress believed that allowing
the waiver is appropriate in certain circumstances, which the statute proceeds to lay out in detail. It is true that
there is an administrative cost and a loss of revenue to the Government because of the waiver. It was determined, however,
that these costs are justified. The decision to offer the waiver does not conflict with the National Performance Review,
because the Administration's position concerning a fair return for resources must be applied in light of the particular
facts involved, including other Administration positions, such as the policy of helping small business. Additionally,
it is the Administration's position that a royalty on production should be instituted in separate Mining Law reform
legislation, which would also apply to small miners. This is where the return for resources is more fairly applied.
Only approximately 10 percent of all active mining claims on Federal land are eligible to be excused from the maintenance
fee, so the vast majority of claims will be subject to maintenance fees paid by the claimants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that paragraph (a) should not allow mill and tunnel sites to be waived if listed on a small miner waiver
certification. Such sites will be eligible for waiver, because the Act of August 10, 1993, specifically allows a waiver
of the maintenance fee required for mining claims and mill or tunnel sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment objected to paragraph (a)(1), which allows a small miner to pay the fee as well as file for a waiver if so desired.
The comment stated that this is misleading because the fee is nonrefundable and the fee waiver would become moot. The
comment suggested that in such a case as this the fee should be refunded if a small miner waiver is found to be valid. The
purpose of this paragraph, which is similar to language which implemented the rental fee, is to make clear that there
is no penalty for both paying the fee and filing the waiver. The BLM has had a policy of not offering refunds in cases such
as this because of the significant costs associated with processing refunds, and because a decision to pay the fee
and file the waiver is entirely within the discretion of the claimant. It has been determined that such costs go beyond
basic public service and represent a burden on the taxpayer. However, the regulation provides at &sect;3833.1&hyph;1(d)
that in such a case the claimant could apply the payment to a subsequent year if the most current claim fee is waived through
the small miner certification process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments asked whether paragraph (a)(1) allows for claimants to pay the fee for some claims and get the waiver for
some if they have 10 or fewer total. The answer is no because the statute requires that if eligible claimants decide
to apply for the small miner waiver they must do so for all their claims. This paragraph does allow for a claimant to both
pay and file for a small miner waiver for all or some of his or her claims, but all of the claims count in deciding whether
the claimant is qualified for the small miner waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that paragraph (a)(1) should provide that if only one co-owner has more than 10 claims that only
his or her interest in the claims will be forfeited in the event of non-payment under &sect;3833.4. This depends on
the relationship between the parties. If the co-owners are not related parties as defined in the law and this rule,
the claim would be void as to the non-small miner co-owner only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding paragraph (a)(3) one comment asked how a claimant makes a certification for mill and tunnel sites when assessment
work is not required for sites. Simply listing sites on the small miner waiver form will act as a notice of intention
to hold and will suffice for certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3), a small miner who owned only mill or tunnel sites could get
a waiver. The answer is yes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (a)(3) should state that mill and tunnel sites are required to be active for the fee
to be waived. The maintenance fee is collected only in lieu of the assessment work requirement, 30 U.S.C. 28&hyph;28e.
No activity level is specified for mill sites in those sections of the Mining Law. Therefore, no such requirement has
been added to this rule. The validity of millsites may, nevertheless, still be challenged based on the requirements
in 30 U.S.C. 42.

One comment asked if paragraph (a)(3) meant that if mill sites are listed on a small miner certification, this would
constitute a filing of a notice of intention to hold. The answer is yes, and this is further clarified in &sect;3833.1&hyph;7(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (b) required that a reclamation plan be approved before the claimant can file
the certification statement, whether a closure date is required under the certification, and whether a statement
will have to be filed every year until closure. The comment also pointed out that notice-level reclamation work does
not need to be approved by the authorized officer. Another comment questioned the procedure to be followed on lands
where the surface is not managed by BLM. Unless only notice-level activities are being conducted on the mining claim,
a reclamation plan is required to be approved before a certification statement can be filed. This paragraph has been
amended to add ``in consultation with'' the authorized officer to cover notice-level operators who describe such
reclamation plans in their notice, but are not required to have them approved. Such reclamation plans, whether a part
of notice- or plan-level operations, are always required to be on file prior to any August 31 deadline. No closure date
is required as a part of the certification statement, and such statement will have to be filed every year until closure.
This paragraph also has been amended to clarify the process for claims for which the surface is not managed by BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments urged removal of paragraph (b), with one comment inquiring as to its statutory authority, its legal effect,
and the effect of failure to follow it. It further questioned whether this amounted to paying miners for doing what
they were already obligated to do under the law. Another comment questioned this paragraph as well. Section 10106
of the 1993 Act directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations implementing the maintenance and location fee requirements.
This authority is applied here to exempt from the maintenance fee claims being reclaimed after mining. A valid mining
claim need not be maintained in order for reclamation work to proceed. There is little incentive for claimants to maintain
claims in which the minerals have been exhausted. It is in the Department's interest to encourage claimants to retain
a mining claim until reclamation is complete. Excusing a miner from the maintenance fee during reclamation does not
in any way release the miner from the obligation to reclaim, which remains as before. Release of the bond serves as incentive
for reclamation. If the claimant is found to have filed a false certification, then appropriate action, including
penalties under 18 U.S.C 1001, may be instituted. Any failure to reclaim will be dealt with under applicable regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) has been amended to make it clear that an agency other than the National Park Service may deny access to
a claimant's mining claim. All such denials may be grounds for a waiver under this paragraph. A new subordinate paragraph
(3) has been added for the purpose of clarity to provide that the certification filed under paragraph (d) may serve
as notice of intention to hold under Section 314 of FLPMA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments stated that paragraph (e), dealing with deferments, is inconsistent with the maintenance fee statute,
which requires payment of the fee at specified times. One comment also stated that the fee cannot be deferred if, as
in the case of the non-small miner, no assessment work is required. The language in this paragraph is similar to language
in the rental fee regulations. The plain language of the Act of August 10, 1993, states that the fee is to be paid in lieu
of the assessment work when it is required. When the assessment work is deferred, the maintenance fee may also be deferred.
When a deferment ends, for the period in which the assessment work requirement was replaced by the maintenance fee,
the deferred maintenance fee must then be paid. One comment referred to this section as providing for granting a waiver,
but this is not correct. It provides for a deferment of fees that will have to be paid at the termination of the deferment.

, 128 IBLA 165. This decision found that only those claimants with 10 or fewer claims can obtain a deferment of assessment
work. That decision was based on the previous rule, implementing the rental fee requirements, which is being replaced
by this rule. It was not the intent of the Department to limit deferments to small miners in the last rule and it is not
the intent in this rule. Deferments under this paragraph may be obtained for any number of claims. The

One comment stated that paragraph (e)(1)(ii), redesignated (e)(2) in the final rule, departed from current policy.
This paragraph is basically the same as the paragraph that applied to deferments in the rental fee regulations. It
has never been the policy of BLM for claims to be automatically forfeited if a deferment is denied and the August 31 deadline
has passed. In the current regulations, as well as under this rule, a 30-day period from the receipt of a deferment petition
denial is allowed before payment of the fee is due. Spurious filings merely to delay payment of the fee have not been
and should not be a problem, because fee payment is only potentially delayed, but not excused, in the case of a deferment
denial.

One comment requested clarification of paragraph (e)(1). Under this paragraph it is possible for a small miner who
is exempt from payment of the $100 fee to have his or her assessment work deferred. A small miner who is also applying
for a deferment should certify as part of the waiver statement due on August 31 that assessment work that would otherwise
have been done within the subject assessment year will be done after the expiration of the deferment. This paragraph
has been amended in the final rule to make this requirement clear.

One comment asked whether a claimant who paid a rental fee by August 31, 1993, for the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year
must now do assessment work in the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year to obtain a waiver and hold the claim for the 1994&hyph;1995
assessment year, and certify to such by August 31, 1994, in order to qualify for a small-miner waiver. The answer is
yes, because if the requirement were interpreted otherwise, the one fee payment made in 1993 would hold the claim for
2 years rather than 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that BLM's fee waivers for small miners are not noted on the land records. The comment noted that
when the fee is paid, it is shown on the record, which therefore clearly shows good standing for the claim. It is true
that the BLM will not formally note acceptance of the waiver application on the land records. The BLM does not take formal
action to grant waivers, but anyone inspecting BLM records will see whether an abandoned and void decision was issued
and therefore whether a waiver application was rejected. It is also not true that a record showing a fee payment means
that the claim has definitely been deemed in good standing for another year. For instance, if the fee payment is by a
check that is returned unpaid by the bank, such payment will be judged to not have occurred and the claims will be declared
void if the payment deadline has already passed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) was amended to insert the word ``filing'' to make clear that what is described in the paragraph is a proper
certification filing. However, this does not mean that the claimant will automatically receive a waiver; the certification
filed is required to be consistent with the small miner's actual situation as of August 31, 1994, as determined by BLM.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments asked for clarification of paragraph (a). A valid exemption application having been filed by August
31, 1993, does not guarantee that the small miner's claim maintenance fee will be waived for the 1994&hyph;1995 assessment
year. This will only happen if all the same elements that existed in the 1993 filing exist on August 31, 1994, the most
obvious being the same number of mining claims. Otherwise the claimant will have to file a new waiver statement by August
31, 1994, or at least a supplemental statement. However, claimants whose situations have not changed since the 1993
filing need not file another certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) has been amended to make it clear that the assessment year beginning on September 1, 1994, is the year
for which a claim is held when the small miner certifies to assessment work done in the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year
by August 31, 1994. Also, a sentence repeating information existing in other sections has been removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3) has been amended to make it clear that, for the purposes of obtaining the small miner waiver, the claimant
is required to certify that the assessment work has been performed or will be performed by the date the payment is due,
which is August 31 for each year the Act of August 10, 1993, is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment correctly observed that no waiver can be granted until after August 31 because the Act requires that the
small miner have 10 or fewer claims on that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (a) was correct in allowing an exemption filed under the rental fee statute by
August 31, 1993, certifying that assessment work has been done in the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year, to constitute
a proper filing for the waiver statement due on August 31, 1994, under the maintenance fee statute. The answer is yes.
The rental fee statute required that claimants filing for the small miner exemption certify by August 31, 1993, that
they would perform $100 worth of assessment work during the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year. The maintenance fee
statute requires that claimants filing for the small miner waiver certify by August 31, 1994, that they have performed
the $100 worth of assessment work for the same 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year. Because in such a case the $100 worth
of work had already been certified to under the old law, it was determined that the new law did not require a doubling
of assessment work, but that the same $100 worth of work could be used. To require $200 worth of work in the same year would
be in conflict with the Mining Law of 1872, which requires only $100. This situation came about because the two laws
overlap for the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year as to the assessment work requirement for qualified small miners.
The old rental fee statute will expire in 1994, and there is no further overlap of laws. Therefore, a small miner who
qualified as such in 1993 need not take any action on August 31, 1994, if his or her situation has not changed since August
31, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested that pursuant to paragraph (a) claimants in this category should make filings by means of a new
``renewal'' form to be created. This would be more complicated than the process envisioned in this paragraph of the
proposed rule, because it would be duplicative. If a small miner could report no change from what was reported in the
exemption filing completed by August 31, 1993, then there is no purpose in requiring the miner to make any sort of new
filing by August 31, 1994, if he or she intends to obtain another waiver to hold the claim for the 1994&hyph;1995 assessment
year. Under the proposed rule the claimant would not have to make a new filing. However, the situation may have changed
since the claimant filed in 1993; for example, the claimant may now own seven claims instead of five. Such a claimant
would need to make a new filing by August 31, 1994, to reflect the changes. This could be done on the new waiver form, which
is not any more complicated than a ``renewal'' form would be. Because of this, a renewal form will not be created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments said that paragraph (a) needed clarification. The paragraph means that if a claimant properly filed
a certification by August 31, 1993, under the rental fee requirements, stating that he or she would perform the necessary
assessment work in the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year to hold the claim for that same assessment year, and did subsequently
perform the assessment work, then he or she need not file a waiver statement by August 31, 1994. This does not mean that
the certification filed in 1993 automatically leads to a waiver to hold the claims for 1994&hyph;1995. The claimant's
1993 statement and BLM records as of August 31, 1994, would have to be found to support a waiver for one to be allowed.
For instance, if a claimant had added claims since the 1993 filing and had more than 10 claims on August 31, 1994, he or
she would not be granted a waiver on the basis of information submitted in 1993, which no longer accurately reflects
the status of the claimant. Such a claimant would have to pay the fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments stated that paragraph (c), which allows a waiver statement to serve as a notice of intention to hold, where
required, should specify the situation where such a filing is required. The primary case where this would apply would
be as to mill and tunnel sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated correctly that paragraph (c) should refer to obtaining the small miner waiver for the assessment
year ``beginning'' at noon on September 1, 1994, rather than ``ending.'' This correction has been made in this final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked about provisions for filing of a notice of intention to hold for mill sites and tunnel sites included
in a small miner waiver. These provisions can be found in paragraph (c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding paragraph (d) one comment asked whether each miner in a group or organization had to file a certification
statement. Each miner with an ownership interest in a claim is required to be identified and sign the certified statement
as provided in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5).

Two comments asked if the references in paragraph (d) to a ``certified statement'' means the statement is required
to be notarized. The answer is no, and the phrase ``certified statement'' has been changed to ``statement'' or ``waiver
certification,'' as appropriate to the context, in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (d) should require evidence of actual work on a claim such as proof of a Notice or Plan
of Operations as was required under the old rental fee statute. The requirement for a Plan or Notice was statutory under
the rental fee regulations, while the maintenance fee statute only calls for submission of proof of annual assessment.
Therefore, the Plan of Operations or Notice requirement was not included in this rule. The BLM will perform periodic
inspections of mining claims in order to make certain that work is being performed on mining claims for which fees are
waived. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether, pursuant to paragraph (d), a claimant who has one claim, and who is a member of a corporation
that has nine claims, other members of which have other claims, can receive the small miner waiver. The answer depends
upon whether the claimant is a ``related party'' to the corporation and other members of the corporation. A ``related
party'' is defined in the Act as one who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, another. The Act
goes on to provide that control includes actual control, legal control, and the power to exercise control, through
or by common directors, officers, stockholders, a voting trust, or a holding company or investment company, or any
other means. Whether a claimant is a related party for purposes of qualifying as a small miner will be determined on
a case-by-case basis. Because this question has been raised in a public comment, BLM will consider a subsequent proposed
rulemaking to provide interpretation of this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment correctly observed that, under paragraph (d)(2), a claimant could file for the small miner waiver before
August 31, and then relinquish any excess claims so as to have 10 or fewer claims by August 31, thereby meeting that requirement
for the waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (d)(5) should require notarization of signatures on the small miner waiver statement.
The reason given was that some claimants use fictitious names to increase acreage in association placer claims. Requiring
notarization would cause far more difficulty for all concerned, with little or no benefit. Meeting the notarization
requirement is especially inconvenient for multiple co-owners. In the event a claimant fraudulently inserts fictitious
names as in the example above, the claim would be open to attack from rival claimants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments requested a clarification of paragraph (e)(2). The Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act allows mining
claims held by persons on active military duty, or within 6 months of their release from active duty, or during or within
6 months after their release from any period of hospitalization due to military injuries, to be exempt from the assessment
work requirement. Likewise, such claims will be exempt from the maintenance fee requirement. The official notice
filed by a person that he or she has entered active duty in the military service should also include the scheduled date
of discharge. Military personnel would be subject to all assessment work or fee requirements 6 months following discharge,
unless proof of re-enlistment is submitted that includes a new discharge date. A person who has been on active duty
since before August 30, 1994, is required to file notice of such active duty status in the assessment year he or she wishes
the exemption to begin. Beginning September 1, 1994, any decision voiding a claim to which this exemption applies,
for nonpayment of the maintenance fee, will be vacated. This provision has been added to paragraph (e)(2) in the final
rule. Filing a notice of intention to hold is not necessary, because fee payments for mill and tunnel sites, for instance,
would merely be exempted in this case. As long as a qualified claimant follows the requirements of this paragraph,
the claim cannot be considered abandoned for failure to pay the maintenance fee. Section (e) has also been amended
to make it clear that, for a claimant to qualify under this section, he or she must own the claim without any unqualified
co-owners, and cannot be controlled by anyone who is unqualified under this section. Finally, for the purpose of clarity,
the order of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) in the proposed rule has been reversed in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that paragraph (f) should be removed because it would allow claimants who cannot perform assessment
work in National Parks, for example, also to avoid paying the maintenance fee. Because the assessment work restriction
within National Parks does not automatically signify that a claimant has been denied all access to his or her mining
claim(s), BLM has accepted this comment and paragraph (f) has been removed in the final rule. Claimants who hold mining
claims within National Parks and who would otherwise file a notice of intention to hold must pay the maintenance fee
to hold their claims unless they are denied all access to their mining claims by the National Park Service or they are
qualified as a small miner. Claimants who have been denied all access to their mining claims by the National Park Service
or other governmental agencies may seek relief from the maintenance fee under &sect;3833.1&hyph;6(d).

One comment asked if fees or charges should be returnable if the claims are still shown as active on BLM records but have
been voided or abandoned by operation of law, but for which a decision has not yet been issued. The answer is yes, if for
some reason payments are made on such claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments asked what the term ``docketed'' in paragraph (a) means. This word and other terms of art have been removed
and replaced with other terms to clarify the point at which service charges cannot be returned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked if service charges for amended locations will also be returnable under paragraph (b). The answer
is yes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment disagreed that paragraph (b) allows service charges to be returnable in such a case. Service charges must
be returnable in this case because the charges were paid for a service that will not be performed. For instance, if a
small miner submits the service charge with his or her annual assessment filing on a claim that is already abandoned
and void by operation of law, the service that the charges are for (to process the annual filing submitted) will never
be rendered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (c) should refer to the time of ``submission'' of fees rather than the time ``fees
were paid.'' The term ``time of submission'' is more precise and the final rule has been amended accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (c) did not cover all instances for which fees may be refunded. This paragraph has been
amended to add overpayments as a reason for refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked for a clarification of whether paragraph (d) means that BLM will only refund duplicate payments
when requested to. The answer is yes, but the final rule regarding this process has been amended to give the claimant
a choice between a refund or an application of the excess fees to a future year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (d) should not apply to maintenance fees, but instead a new paragraph should be added
in which application of the duplicate fees to a future year would be automatic unless a refund is issued. This paragraph
has been amended to require that claimants who overpay their fee be given the choice either to receive a refund or to
apply the fees to a subsequent year. Claimants will be notified in every case, because they have a right to direct how
their overpayment is to be treated, and must know how much they have already contributed to the next year's payment
in order to adjust their payment for the next year.

One comment stated that the term ``mineral entry'' is inconsistent with terminology in 43 CFR 3851.5(a) and should
be changed to reflect this. It is inappropriate to make this change because the term is used in this section as it is in
43 CFR subpart 3851. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment challenged the statutory authority for this section. The comment stated that allowance of mineral entry
is only an early hurdle in the patent process, and a claim at that point remains unpatented and thus subject to the fee.
The comment also stated that associated regulations that allow assessment work to be excused in such a case are similarly
erroneous. There is no specific statutory authority for this section, but there are significant numbers of judicial
decisions supporting it. The end of the obligation to file proof of performance of assessment work is a part of the recognition
of mineral entry, which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The similar treatment of the maintenance fee payment
is also a recognition of this mineral entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

One comment stated that paragraph (c) in the proposed rule is misleading because it refers to transfers of interest
``being effective'' on the date of recordation with BLM and also refers to ``BLM record title purposes,'' which it
said implies that BLM records reflect the true state of legal title for mining claims. This paragraph has been amended
in the final rule to make it clear that the recordation date of a transfer of interest is merely the effective date for
BLM record purposes. The paragraph is further amended by removing the phrase ``For BLM record title purposes'' to
eliminate this confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments asked for a clarification of paragraph (c). The paragraph means to say that a transfer is first officially
shown on BLM records as of the date of recordation with BLM. The actual effective date of the transfer is determined
by State law.

One comment said that paragraph (a)(3), which deals with failure to perform assessment work on or before the date of
the filing of a waiver statement, cannot result in forfeiture of the claim because this is not allowed under the Mining
Law. The comment further stated that retroactive forfeiture of a claim for failure to perform assessment work once
the waiver has already been granted should not be allowed. This paragraph is only referring to situations where a claimant
would file a false statement which says that assessment work had been performed when it had not. In such a case, upon
investigation, the claims would be declared void for failure to pay the maintenance fee, given that an invalid waiver
certification was filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

however, merely deals with determining who is the owner of a claim, not where he or she lives. Therefore, it does not
run afoul of the cited decision of IBLA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that paragraph (a) should clearly state that the year referred to means assessment year. This amendment
has been made in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that the phrase ``ownership records'' in paragraph (b) should be changed to ``BLM records''
to underscore that BLM is not the official repository of mining claim ownership records. The BLM does not consider
itself the keeper of the definitive record of ownership, and this paragraph in the proposed rule is not intended to
imply that it is. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that the phrase ``record title'' in paragraph (c) should be changed to ``BLM records'' in order to
avoid suggesting that the BLM ownership records are the official legal title records. The paragraph has been amended
to remove this misleading implication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal authors of this final rule are Frank Bruno and Roger Haskins of the Division of Solid Minerals, assisted
by the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management, BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this final rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The BLM has determined that this rule is categorically excluded
from further environmental review pursuant to 516 Departmental Manual, Chapter 2, Appendix 1, Item 1.10, and that
the rule will not significantly affect the 10 criteria for exceptions listed in 516 DM 2, Appendix 2. Pursuant to the
Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1508.4) and environmental policies and procedures of the Department
of the Interior, ``categorical exclusions'' means a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment and that have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted
by a Federal agency and for which neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also certifies that this document will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number
of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The fee may represent an economic consideration for a small, marginal operation that does not qualify for an exemption
under the rule. However, most small operations would qualify. A small entity that holds a valuable mining claim will
not be deterred by the annual fee, and many of them will qualify for an exemption. Most marginal claims were already
abandoned in 1993 upon promulgation of the regulations implementing the Act of October 5, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by Executive Order 12630, the Department of the Interior has determined that the rule would not cause a
taking of private property. The requirement that a modest fee be paid to hold or maintain an existing unpatented mining
claim, mill or tunnel site constitutes a reasonable regulatory burden, and it will have no effect on a claimant's use
of his or her claim or site as long as he or she complies with the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards
provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions for collection of information contained at 43 CFR Parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850, and subpart 3809
have previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned clearance numbers 1004&hyph;0104,
1004&hyph;0110, and 1004&hyph;0114. Information collections for Parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850 were consolidated
under clearance number 1004&hyph;0114 in the July 15, 1993, rule (58 FR 38186). As this rule removes obsolete or inoperative
sections of Title 43, Code of Federal Regulations, and extends the information collection-related effect of the
previously enacted Act of October 5, 1992, and implementing regulations published on July 15, 1993, this rule does
not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under
44 U.S.C. 3501

(e) Sections 10101&hyph;10106 of the Act of August 10, 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 405), require an annual
maintenance fee of $100 to be paid to the proper State Office of the Bureau of Land Management for each non-waived mining
claim, mill site, or tunnel site. With certain exceptions provided in &sect;3833.1&hyph;6, this fee is in lieu of
the requirement to perform and record annual assessment work under 30 U.S.C. 28&hyph;28e and section 314(a) of FLPMA.
Failure to pay the fee within the time limits prescribed by the Act of August 10, 1993, constitutes a statutory abandonment
and forfeiture of the non-waived mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site. Provisions relating to maintenance fees
and waivers are contained in &sect;&sect;3833.0&hyph;3(f), 3833.1&hyph;5, 3833.1&hyph;6, and 3833.1&hyph;7.

states that the maintenance fee provision shall not apply to any oil shale claims for which a fee is required to be paid
under Section 2511(e)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The $550 fee requirement for oil shale claims remains in
effect. The $550 fee is first payable on or before December 31, 1993, and on or before each December 31st thereafter.

13, 1993, until a notice of intent to locate has been filed with the proper BLM State Office and the surface owner is notified
of the filing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)(i) When a notice of intent to locate a mining claim has been properly filed by a mining claimant, no other person
may, until 90 days after the date the notice of intent is filed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) File such a notice with respect to any portions of the lands covered by the first notice; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Explore for minerals or locate a mining claim on any portion of such lands; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) File an application to acquire any interest in any portion of such lands pursuant to Section 209 of the Federal Land
Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1719). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The 90-day exclusive right may be extended by filing a Plan of Operations pursuant to subpart 3809 of this title.
The extension runs until the BLM has approved or denied the Plan of Operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The mining claimant may not locate mining claims on the lands encompassed by a notice under the Act of April 16, 1993,
until at least 30 days after he or she has properly notified the surface owner by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested.

 All service charges, maintenance fees, and location fees shall be payable by United States currency, postal money
order, or negotiable instrument payable in United States currency, and shall be made payable to the Department of
the Interior_Bureau of Land Management, or by a valid credit card acceptable to the Bureau of Land Management. A check
or negotiable instrument, including credit cards submitted for payment of charges and/or fees, for which payment
is not honored by the issuing authority, and such refusal is not an error of the issuing authority, will be deemed to
be a nonpayment of the charges or fees for which the check or negotiable instrument, including a credit card order,

accepted, and the submittal will be returned without further action by the authorized officer. The claimant may resubmit
the filings with the proper payment of service charges and fees within the same 90-day filing period referred to in
&sect;3833.1&hyph;2(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Failure to provide full payment of service charges set forth in &sect;3833.1&hyph;4 will be curable for new location
notices or certificates submitted for recording pursuant to &sect;3833.1&hyph;2 when the proper maintenance and
location fees have been submitted. Such documents will be noted as being recorded on the date received provided that
the claimant submits the proper service charge either within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice sent by the authorized
officer, or on or before the 90th day of the filing period referred to in 3833.1&hyph;2(a), whichever date is later.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the proper service charges have not been tendered pursuant to paragraph (b)(2), and if the claimant has not provided
written instructions regarding the application of the funds received with the original filing, the authorized officer

and filings made pursuant to &sect;&sect;3833.2 and 3833.3 and amended locations filed under &sect;3833.1. Such
documents and filings will be noted as being recorded on the date initially received, provided that the claimant submits
the proper service charge within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice from the authorized officer. Failure to
submit the proper service charge as required by this paragraph will cause filings made pursuant to &sect;&sect;3833.2
and 3833.3 and amended locations filed under &sect;3833.1 to be rejected and returned to the claimant/owner. If a
payment is received that partially covers the claims submitted, the payment shall be applied to mining claims and
sites in ascending numerical order of serialization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a claimant fails to submit the proper maintenance fees on or before each August 31, the authorized officer will
apply the fees received to existing recorded and serialized mining claims and sites in ascending numerical order
of serialization, unless otherwise directed by the claimant. The authorized officer will note the deficient fees
as being paid on the original date received, provided that the claimant submits the proper fees within 30 days of receipt
of a deficiency notice from the authorized officer, if that much time remains before August 31. If there are less than
30 days before August 31, the correct fees shall be filed (see &sect;3833.0&hyph;5(m)) by such claimant on or before
the August 31 deadline. Failure to submit the proper fees will cause the forfeiture of remaining claims or sites by
the claimant/owner.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) If a waived mining claim or site is transferred in total or in part to a party not qualified for a waiver, the waiver
is forfeited for the mining claim or site or portion of interest therein transferred to the unqualified party. The

&sect;3833.1&hyph;6 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Maintenance fee waiver qualifications under the Act of August 10, 1993, and other exceptions_applicable from 12
o'clock noon on September 1, 1993, until 12 o'clock noon September 1, 1999. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A small miner may, under certain conditions described in this section and in &sect;3833.1&hyph;7, perform the assessment
work required under 30 U.S.C. 28&hyph;28e and record it pursuant to Section 314(a) of FLPMA and &sect;3833.2 in lieu
of paying the maintenance fee. Assessment work shall conform to the requirements contained in subpart 3851 of this
title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) In order to qualify for a waiver of the maintenance fee requirements, a small miner shall meet all of the following
conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claimant and all related parties shall hold no more than 10 mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites, or any
combination thereof, on Federal lands in the United States on the date the payment is due, which is each August 31. For
purposes of determining the small miner waiver, oil shale claims shall not be counted toward the 10 claim limitation
for the small miner waiver of the $100 maintenance fee. A claimant who owns 10 or fewer claims, mill sites, and tunnel
sites, and otherwise meets the requirements of this section, is not precluded from paying the maintenance fee in addition
to filing for a small miner waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All mining claims and sites held by a claimant and all related parties shall be counted toward the 10 claim and site
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Mill and tunnel sites of a qualified small miner, if listed upon the exemption certificate along with the affected
lode and placer mining claims, are waived from payment of the maintenance fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Mining claims and sites that are undergoing final reclamation, as approved by the authorized officer pursuant
to subparts 3802, 3809, or 3814 of this title, with no intent by the owner thereof to continue mining, milling, or processing
operations upon or under the mining claims or sites, are excused from payment of the maintenance fees. The owner shall
file a certified statement by August 31 in the proper BLM office attesting to the reclamation status of the affected
mining claims and/or sites, with reference to a reclamation plan approved by the authorized officer for plan-level
activities or submitted in consultation with the authorized officer for notice-level activities, and to his or her
intent to place them into permanent closure. If the surface is managed by an entity other than BLM, the claimant shall
submit evidence of a final reclamation plan that conforms to the requirements of the managing entity. A certified
statement of such intent and reclamation shall be filed pursuant to &sect;3833.1&hyph;7. The number of mining claims
or sites that may properly qualify for a reclamation waiver pursuant to this paragraph is not restricted to a 10-claim
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Pursuant to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act (50 U.S.C. Appendix 565), military personnel on active duty
status may, under certain conditions, qualify for an exemption from the performance of assessment work and the payment
of maintenance fees. See &sect;&sect;3833.1&hyph;7(e)(2) and 3851.6 of this title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Under the following circumstances, a waiver may be obtained from the payment of the maintenance fee for mining
claims and sites: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claimant has received a declaration of taking or a notice of intent to take from the National Park Service pursuant
to Sections 6 and 7 of the Act of September 28, 1976, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1905, 1906), or the Act of December 2, 1980,
as amended (16 U.S.C. 3192); or the claimant has otherwise been denied access by the United States to his/her mining
claims or sites.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The claimant shall file proof of the above conditions for exemption, attested to as a certified statement, pursuant
to &sect;3833.1&hyph;7, with the proper BLM office by the August 31 immediately preceding the assessment year for
which a waiver is sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The certified statement required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, serves as a notice of intention to hold as
to mining claims and sites for which the exemption is sought. In such cases, the payment of the $5 service charge per
claim or site is due upon filing the certification statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Payment of the maintenance fee for mining claims covered by a deferment of assessment work granted by the authorized
officer pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 28 (b)&hyph;(e) and subpart 3852 of this title may be deferred during the period for which
the deferment is granted. Deferments are governed by the following rule. If a petition for a deferment of assessment
work, as required by &sect;3852.2 of this title, is filed with the proper BLM office on or before August 31 for a given
year, the maintenance fee need not be paid on the claims listed in the petition for deferment until the authorized officer
has acted upon the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the petition is granted, maintenance fees for the claims are deferred for the upcoming assessment year. At the
expiration of the deferment, all deferred fees shall be paid within 30 days of the end of the deferment, unless the claimant/owner
qualifies as a small miner. If the claimant/owner qualifies as a small miner, all deferred assessment work shall be
performed as provided in &sect;3852.5 of this title upon expiration of the deferment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the petition for deferment is denied by the authorized officer, the maintenance fees shall be paid within 30
days of receipt of the decision of the authorized officer denying the petition for deferment. Failure to pay the maintenance
fees owed will result in the forfeiture of the claims contained within the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) On mining claims for which an application for a mineral patent has been filed, and the mineral entry has been allowed,
the payment of the maintenance fee is excused for the assessment years during which assessment work is not required
pursuant to &sect;3851.5 of this title. However, no refund of previously deposited maintenance fees will be made
to the mineral patent applicant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If no change in status has occurred, a small miner exemption certification previously filed for the assessment
year ending at noon on September 1, 1994, under the Act of October 5, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;381, 106 Stat. 1374), and
the pertinent regulations in effect on August 31, 1993, will be considered a proper certification filing for a waiver
of payment of the maintenance fee due on August 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The affidavit of assessment work performed by a small miner claiming a maintenance fee waiver shall be filed with
the proper BLM office pursuant to &sect;3833.2 and shall meet the requirements of &sect;3833.2&hyph;4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For mining claims and sites covered by a waiver, the filing of a waiver certification pursuant to any of paragraphs
(a), (d), (e), or (f) of this section will satisfy the requirements for filing of a notice of intention to hold pursuant
to &sect;3833.2&hyph;5, when such notice of intention to hold is otherwise required. In such a case the payment of
the $5 service charge per claim/site for processing the notice of intention to hold is due upon filing of the waiver
statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In order to hold mining claims or sites for the assessment year beginning at 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 1994,
each small miner shall file a waiver certification on or before August 31, 1994. Each small miner shall file a waiver
certification on or before August 31 each year thereafter to hold the claims each assessment year beginning at 12 o'clock
noon on September 1 of the calendar year the certification is due, through August 31, 1998. The small miner shall document,
as provided in this paragraph (d), the claimed waiver for each assessment year a small miner's waiver is claimed, certified,
and attested to under penalty of 18 U.S.C. 1001. The statement shall contain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The mining claim and site names and BLM serial numbers assigned to the mining claims and sites held by the small miner;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A declaration by the claimant and all related parties that they own no more than 10 mining claims and sites in total
nationwide on the date the waiver statement is due; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A declaration that specifies that the assessment work requirements have been or will be completed by the date the
payment is due, which is each August 31, for the assessment year just ending; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The names and addresses of all owners maintaining an interest in the mining claims and sites; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The signatures of all the owners of the mining claims and sites for which a waiver is claimed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Pursuant to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act, and &sect;3851.6 of this title, a military person entering
active service may file, or cause to be filed, in the proper BLM office, a notice of his or her entry into active military
service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The filing of the notice excuses the person from performing assessment work or paying the maintenance fees until
6 months have passed from the person's release from active duty status, or until 6 months have passed after release
from a military hospital, whichever is later. To be excused from paying the maintenance fee, the person cannot hold
the subject claim or site with a related party, as defined in paragraph 3833.0&hyph;5(y), who does not also qualify
under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The notice must be filed in the assessment year that the person entered active duty status, or if active duty began
prior to August 30, 1994, the notice must be filed in the assessment year that he or she wishes the benefits provided
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to take effect. If the person previously filed a notice under the Soldiers' and
Sailors' Relief Act to be excused from performing assessment work, and remains qualified under that Act, he or she
will automatically be exempt from paying the maintenance fee.

given by publication in the newspaper published nearest the claim for at least once a week for 90 days. If, upon the expiration
of 90 days, after such notice in writing, or upon the expiration of 180 days after the first newspaper publication of
notice, the delinquent co-owner shall have failed to contribute the proportionate share of such expenditures or
improvements, such interest in the claim by law passes to the co-owners who have made the expenditures or improvements.

(2) Evidence of personal notice of delinquency upon the delinquent party. If notice is effected by mail, the minimum
sufficient evidence shall consist of a copy of the notice and a copy of the return receipt of the U.S. Postal Service
evidencing receipt by the delinquent party of a registered or certified envelope containing the notice. If notice
was made in person, an affidavit signed and dated on the date of notice will suffice as evidence of such notice; and

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the President's announcement on August 20, 1994, the Treasury Department is revoking the general authorizations
permitting cash remittances to Cuba, except to facilitate lawful immigration; revoking the general authorizations
for persons engaging in travel&hyph;related transactions in Cuba for purposes of family visits and professional
research; and significantly restricting the general authorization incorporating the authorization contained
in the General License GIFT, administered by the Department of Commerce, to limit the permissible contents of gift
parcels eligible for exportation to Cuba to medicine, food and strictly humanitarian items. Except for purposes
of facilitating lawful immigration, cash remittances to Cuba will only be permitted for limited humanitarian purposes
through case&hyph;by&hyph;case specific licensing. Charter flights between Miami and Havana will only be authorized
to carry legal immigrants, U.S and foreign government and international organization employees traveling on official
business, journalists, and persons traveling under specific license. Travel&hyph;related transactions by persons
demonstrating a compelling need to travel to Cuba for humanitarian reasons involving extreme hardship, for clearly
and narrowly defined educational and religious activities, for activities of recognized human rights organizations
investigating cases of human rights violations, or for activities related to professional research, telecommunications,
or the exportation, importation, or transmission of information or informational materials will be considered
for a specific license on a case&hyph;by&hyph;case basis.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 20, 1994, President Clinton announced steps to limit the ability of the Cuban government to accumulate foreign
exchange. Accordingly, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Cuban Assets Control Regulations,
31 CFR Part 515 (the ``Regulations''), to implement these measures by revising existing provisions that heretofore
have generally authorized travel&hyph;related transactions, cash remittances, and the shipment of gift parcels
to Cuba. Specifically, &sect;515.533 no longer authorizes exportation to Cuba of gift parcels pursuant to General
License GIFT, &sect;771.18 of the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Parts 768&hyph;799 (the ``EAR''),
except those containing only food, vitamins, seeds, medicines, medical supplies and devices, hospital supplies
and equipment, equipment for the handicapped, clothing, personal hygiene items, veterinary medicines and supplies,
fishing equipment and supplies, soap&hyph;making equipment, or certain radio equipment and batteries for such
equipment. The complete list of eligible items is set forth in &sect;771.18 of the EAR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 515.560 of the Regulations is revised to limit the categories of travelers to Cuba who are generally authorized
to engage in travel&hyph;related transactions to journalists and officials of the United States or foreign governments
or international organizations traveling on official business. ``Fully&hyph;hosted'' travelers are no longer
authorized to travel aboard charter flights between the United States and Cuba. Section 515.416 is revised to set
forth the criteria by which specific licenses may be issued for travel&hyph;related transactions for ``professional
research.'' Travel transactions by close relatives of Cuban nationals may only be authorized on a case&hyph;by&hyph;case
basis by specific license, and only under circumstances of extreme hardship. Specific licenses for travel&hyph;related
transactions may still be issued for other strictly humanitarian purposes, for clearly defined educational or religious
activities, for activities of recognized human rights organizations investigating human rights violations, or
for activities related to professional research, telecommunications, or the exportation, importation or transmission
of information or informational materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 515.563, which previously provided general authorization for family remittances for the support of close
relatives in Cuba, is revised to permit transfers of funds to Cuba only if authorized on a case&hyph;by&hyph;case
basis for humanitarian purposes upon a demonstration of extreme hardship. However, payments not exceeding $500
to facilitate a close relative's lawful immigration to the United States remain generally licensed. All other general
authorizations contained in the Regulations for remittances are revoked. In particular, &sect;515.564 is revised
to specify that remittances to Cuba for purposes of facilitating a Cuban national's travel to the United States for
purposes other than immigration may only be made pursuant to a specific license. Similarly prohibited are remittances
to Cuba in connection with intellectual property protection (&sect;515.528) and public performances (&sect;515.565).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

 Professional research and similar activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Section 515.560(b) sets forth the criteria by which specific licenses for transactions related to travel to,
from, and within Cuba may be issued for persons who are engaging in professional research and similar activities of
a noncommercial, academic nature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Persons are considered to be engaged in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional research
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for purposes of this section only if they are full&hyph;time professionals who travel to Cuba to do research in their
professional areas, their research is specifically related to Cuba and will constitute a full work schedule in Cuba,
and there is a substantial likelihood of public dissemination of the product of their research. No transactions related
to tourist or recreational travel within Cuba are authorized in connection with professional research, except those
that are consistent with a full schedule of research activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Similar activities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 include attendance by professionals with an established interest in Cuba at professional meetings where research
on Cuba is shared, and travel for noncommercial research purposes specifically related to Cuba by persons who are
working to qualify themselves academically as professionals (e.g., certain graduate degree candidates). Study
visits to Cuba in connection with pre&hyph;college or undergraduate college course work are not within the scope
of the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional research and similar activities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Categories of travel which do not qualify as professional research or similar activities and for which specific
license requests will be denied include recreational travel; tourist travel; travel in pursuit of a hobby; general
study tours; general orientation visits; student class field trips; youth camps; research for personal satisfaction
only; travel by fishing or bird&hyph;watching groups and similar affinity groups; and any travel for an authorized
research purpose, if the schedule of activities includes free time, travel, or recreation in excess of that consistent
with a full work schedule of professional research and similar activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A group does not fall within the scope of the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional research and similar activities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 merely because some members of the group could qualify individually for specific licensing under this category.
For example, a specific license authorizing travel&hyph;related transactions by a fish biologist who travels to
Cuba to engage in professional research does not authorize other persons who might travel with the fish biologist
but whose principal purpose in travel is to engage in recreational or trophy fishing. The fact that such persons may
engage in certain activities with, or under the direction of, the professional fish biologist, such as measuring
or recording facts about their catch, does not bring these individuals' activities within the scope of professional
research and similar activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A person will not qualify as engaging in professional research or similar activities merely because that person
is a professional who plans to travel to Cuba. For example, a professor of history interested in traveling to Cuba for
the principal purpose of learning or practicing Spanish or attending general purpose lectures devoted to Cuban culture
and contemporary life would not qualify for a specific license. A doctoral candidate in economics traveling to Cuba
to undertake research for a dissertation on the Cuban economy may qualify for a specific license for activities directly
related to the research, but would not be authorized to stay an extra week in Cuba in order to attend a seminar on Cuban
arts and crafts.

of enabling the payee to emigrate from Cuba to the United States, including the purchase of airline tickets and payment
of visa fees or other travel&hyph;related fees. Such remittances may not exceed $500, and, except for purposes of
processing a letter of invitation or similar document on behalf of a Cuban national, may be transferred only after
the Cuban national has received a valid visa issued by the State Department or other approved U.S. immigration documentation.
Any amount remitted to Cuba directly or indirectly in conjunction with the processing of a letter of invitation or
similar document must be deducted from the $500 limit. Specific licenses may be issued to permit remittances by persons
subject to U.S. jurisdiction to Cuba or a Cuban national, directly or indirectly, for transactions to facilitate
non&hyph;immigrant travel by a Cuban national to the United States under circumstances where extreme humanitarian
need is demonstrated, including terminal illness or severe medical emergency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending &sect;771.18 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
to restrict exports to Cuba under General License GIFT to food, vitamins, seeds, medicines, medical supplies and
devices, hospital supplies and equipment, equipment for the handicapped, clothing, personal hygiene items, veterinary
medicines and supplies, fishing equipment and supplies, soap-making equipment, certain radio equipment, and batteries
for such equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commodities not eligible for export to Cuba under General License GIFT must be authorized either under the Humanitarian
License Procedure (&sect;773.5) or under an individual validated license. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action does not affect the continued general license eligibility of informational materials, as described
in General License GTDA (&sect;779.3) and Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 0A98I in the Commodity Control
List (CCL) (Supplement No. 1 to &sect;799.1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August 20, 1994, the President invoked the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act and continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA and
the EAR in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Savings Clause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Shipments of items removed from general license GIFT authorization as a result of this regulatory action may be exported
under the previous general license provisions up to and including September 13, 1994. Any such items 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not actually exported before midnight September 13, 1994, require a validated export license in accordance with
this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Rulemaking Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694&hyph;0005,
0694&hyph;0010 and 0694&hyph;0033.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves
a military and foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed
rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on
this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Sharron Cook, Office of Technology
and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) to exempt from assessments producers
with less than 10 acres of watermelons rather than 5 acres and importers of less than 150,000 pounds, cover all 50 States
by the Plan, and revise the criteria for determining the eligibility of producers to serve on the Board. In addition,
conforming changes would be made to the rules and regulations issued under the Plan and the rules of practice for petitions.
Furthermore, the Department is announcing that a referendum will be conducted among eligible producers, handlers,
and importers to determine whether they favor the elimination of refunds of assessments and (2) whether they favor
the assessment of watermelon imports and the addition of importer members to the National Watermelon Promotion Board
(Board).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan [7 CFR 1210], hereinafter referred as the
Plan. The Plan is effective under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act, as amended by the Watermelon Research
and Promotion Improvement Act of 1993 [7 U.S.C. 4901&hyph;4916], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under &sect;1650
of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision
of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification
of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition.
After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the
United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date
of the entry of the ruling.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,000 watermelon producers in the contiguous 48 States of the United States who are subject to the Plan. There are approximately
140 importers of watermelons. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5 million and small agricultural producers are defined
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of watermelon handlers, producers, and importers
may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in the Plan, rules and regulations, and rules of practice for petitions reflect amendments to the Act.
The overall economic impact of these proposed changes is not expected to be significant. Including all 50 States and
the District of Columbia under the Plan will have little impact. The producer exemption from assessments would be
increased from 5 acres to 10 acres. This change would benefit small producers because it would increase the exemption
level, and small producers would not have to pay the assessment. The eligibility criteria for determining if a person
is a handler or a producer would not have any economic impact. The elimination of refunds may have some impact on a small
amount of producers and handlers who are currently entitled to refunds. There will also be a new burden on importers
caused by the assessment of imports, but importers are currently benefiting from the activities which promote watermelons
without paying assessments. The research and promotion program is expected to continue to benefit producers, handlers,
and importers subject to the Plan by expanding and maintaining new and existing markets. Accordingly, the Administrator
of AMS has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[40 U.S.C. chapter 35], the information collection requirements contained in the Plan have previously been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0093. There would be a new reporting
burden on importers but the burden has been already approved by the OMB and assigned OMB control number 0581&hyph;0093.
This action adds no additional reporting burden. It has been estimated that it will take an average of 10 minutes for
each producer, handler, and importer of watermelons to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Plan, the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) administers a nationally coordinated program of
research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's position in the market
place and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for domestic watermelons. This program is financed by assessments
on all producers, except those persons engaged in the growing of less than five acres of watermelons, and handlers
of watermelons. The Plan specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and submitting both the producer
and handler assessments to the Board, reporting their handling of watermelons, and maintaining records necessary
to verify their reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. production of watermelons is estimated through the use of U.S. shipment statistics. Shipments of U.S.-produced
watermelons totaled about 1,895.6 million pounds in 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 percent less than in 1992. Imports of watermelons in 1993 totalled 343.5 million pounds, an increase of 12 percent.
Therefore, domestic production is about six times as great as the volume of imports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 14, 1994 [59 FR 17739]. The rule published in April contained the proposed amendments to the Plan, rules and
regulations, rules of practice for petitions, and referendum procedures. In order to have the referendum procedures
in place for the referendum, the Department decided to separately make final the referendum procedures. Therefore,
this proposed rule contains the proposed amendments to the Plan, rules and regulations, and rules of practice for
petitions. A final rule published separately in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contains the referendum procedures which will be used in the referendum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deadline for comments on the proposed amendments published on April 14 was May 16, 1994. Twenty-one comments were
received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighteen comments related to this proposed rule. Sixteen commentors stated their support of the proposed amendments
to the Plan. They stated that per capita consumption of watermelons is on the increase again and that the National Watermelon
Promotion Board (Board) has achieved many successes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commentors stated that they are not in favor of the Plan and that they were not aware that a refund provision was available.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A referendum was conducted in 1989 to determine if majority of watermelon growers and handlers favored the passage
of an industry funded research and promotion program for watermelons. The Plan is intended to collect assessments
for research and promotion of watermelons. Currently, any individual not favoring the program can request a refund
of the assessments paid by that individual. Procedures to request a refund of assessments are explained in the Plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the Act authorize an assessment on watermelons imported into the United States by importers, and
the addition of importer members to the Board if approved by watermelon producers, handlers, and importers in a referendum.
Watermelon imports enter the country primarily during the winter season. Imports of watermelons in 1993 totalled
343.5 million pounds. The assessment rate for imports would be the combined total assessment rate paid by producers
and handlers of domestic watermelons. The current assessment rate for producers is 2 cents per hundredweight and
for handlers is 2 cents per hundredweight. The combined assessment rate for importers, therefore, would be 4 cents
per hundredweight. Assessments will be paid at the time the watermelons enter the country. The collection of assessments
on imported watermelons will be expected to generate an additional $137,400 per year in revenue to the Board. In order
to make these changes, this rule will amend &sect;&sect;1210.305, 1210.320, 1210.321, 1210.328, 1210.341, 1210.350,
1210.351, 1210.352, 1210.363, and 1210.364 of the Plan; &sect;&sect;1210.402 and 1210.405 of the nomination procedures;
and &sect;&sect;1210.515, 1210.518, 1210.519, 1210.521, 1210.530, 1210.531, and 1210.532 of the rules and regulations.
In addition, a new &sect;1210.314 will be added to the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the collection of assessments on imported watermelons, the Secretary proposes that the United States
Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury be designated as the collecting agency for assessments levied on
such imports. Other commodity research and promotion programs utilize the Customs Service as a means of collecting
assessments on imported products, and the Customs Service is agreeable to collecting these watermelon assessments.
An agreement between the USDA and the Customs Service would be entered into to implement this action. In order to make
this changes, this rule would amend &sect;1210.518 of the Rules and Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The importer representation on the Board would be proportionate to the percentage of assessments paid by importers
to the Board, except that at least one representative of importers would serve on the Board if importers are subject
to the Plan. This representation would enable importers to participate in developing the Board's programs, plans,
and projects, and express their views and concerns on how Board funds are used if imports are assessed under the Plan.
Importers would nominate individuals to serve as importer members on the Board, and as required for other members
of the Board, two nominees would be submitted to the Secretary for each vacancy. The Act requires the number of importers
members to be proportionate to the assessments paid by importers. However, it is necessary to calculate the number
of initial importer members on the volume of imports because imports are not currently being assessed. There are currently
14 producers and 14 handlers on the Board. This is the equivalent of one domestic industry member for every 67.7 million
pounds of domestic production. Based on the average annual volume of imports during the last 3-year period (323.1
hundredweight), four importers would be added to the current Board. In order to make this change, this rule would amend
&sect;&sect; 1210.320, 1210.321, and 1210.401. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides for the elimination of refunds of assessments if the producers, handlers, and importers vote to eliminate
refunds. The refund provision has been in effect since the beginning of the program. Refunds have been increasing
every year from 9 percent in 1990 to almost 29 percent in 1993. If the refund provision is eliminated, it would provide
the Board with an estimated additional $250,000 per year for research and promotion activities. In order to make this
change, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.343 and 1210.520. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the refund provision remains in the Plan, and importers are subject to the Plan, then importers would be entitled
to a refund of all assessments paid on watermelons imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act increases the acreage for exempt producers from ``less than 5 acres'' to ``less than 10 acres'' of watermelons.
Importers of less than 150,000 pounds of watermelons per year would be entitled to apply for a refund which would be
the producer equivalent of the import assessments. The 150,000-pound exemption level for importers is the level
determined to be equivalent to 10 acres of watermelons for domestic producers. In addition, the Act provides that
the Board has the authority to establish rules for producers to certify whether they are exempt from the assessments.
In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.341, 1210.342, 1210.518, and 1210.521. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also increases applicability of the law from the 48 contiguous States to the 50 States and the District of Columbia.
This amendment would expand the Plan to cover producers, handlers, and importers in Hawaii, Alaska, and the District
of Columbia. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;1210.305 and would add a new &sect;1210.315.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1647(f) of the Act permits changes in the assessment rate through notice and comment rulemaking. No change
to the Plan is necessary to implement this amendment to the Act because &sect;1210.341 of the Plan states that assessment
rates shall be fixed by the Secretary in accordance with section 1647(f) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that a producer is eligible to serve on the Board as a representative of handlers (1) if a producer purchases
watermelons from other producers in a combined total volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the producer's own
production or (2) if the combined total volume of watermelons handled by the producer from the producer's own production
and purchases from other producer's production is more than 50 percent of the producer's own production. This provision
facilitates the eligibility of producers and handlers to serve on the Board as representatives of their specific
group. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect; 1210.321, 1210.363, 1210.368, and 1210.402.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also provides that all future promulgation and amendment referenda do not have to be conducted at Extension
Service county offices. This procedure proved to be expensive and difficult to administer. The Act would now allow
referenda to be conducted by mail ballot which would reduce the costs involved in conducting referenda and facilitate
a more timely tabulation of the results. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;1210.363. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Act changes the criteria for determining the outcome of referenda. The Act previously provided that
the Plan should not be effective unless approved by not less than two-thirds of the producers and handlers voting in
the referendum, or producers and handlers of not less than two-thirds of the watermelons produced and handled during
the representative period by producers and handlers voting in the referendum, and by not less than a majority of the
producers and a majority of the handlers voting in the referendum. The Act now specifies that the determination of
the results of a referendum should be on the basis of a simple majority of the producers, handlers, and, if covered by
the Plan, importers voting in the referendum. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;1210.363.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, &sect;1210.252 would be revised to correct a wording error made during the promulgation of the Plan
and &sect;1210.322 would be revised to delete obsolete language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;1210.325 would be changed to reflect a change in the number of Board members that constitute a majority.
This revision would reflect the addition of importer members to the Board.

In addition, miscellaneous conforming changes would be made to &sect;&sect;1210.251, 1210.302, 1210.328, 1210.340,

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Small Business Administration (SBA) proposes to amend its regulations governing the Minority Small Business
and Capital Ownership Development program authorized by sections 7(j)(10) and 8(a) of the Small Business Act, 15
U.S.C. 636(j)(10), 637(a). This proposed rule would amend both eligibility requirements for and contractual assistance
provisions within the 8(a) program. Of particular note, this rule would recognize participation of Community Development
Corporations in the 8(a) program to an extent that would not be inconsistent with the requirements of the 8(a) program
as imposed by the Small Business Act, increase the personal net worth limitations for 8(a) applicants and Program
Participants to take into account inflation, eliminate the distinctions established in SBA's regulations concerning
``local'' and ``national buy'' 8(a) requirements, eliminate the restrictions on the number and dollar value of 8(a)
contracts received by Program Participants due to SBA-approved ``support levels'', and eliminate the distinction
for applying the competitive 8(a) requirements currently existing for indefinite quantity or indefinite delivery
requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule, if adopted in final form, would (1) make several clarifications of the eligibility requirements
for admission to SBA's 8(a) program, the need for which has been identified by SBA through the practical experience
gained in operating the program and in defending the agency's actions in 8(a) eligibility appeals brought before
SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), (2) authorize participation by business concerns owned by Community
Development Corporations in the 8(a) program in accord with 42 U.S.C. 9815, and (3) make several changes to the 8(a)
contractual assistance requirements, including eliminating 8(a) support levels and the concepts of local buy and
national buy 8(a) requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule would clarify that 8(a) eligibility decisions are based on the facts before the Associate Administrator
for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development (AA/MSB&amp;COD) at the time of his/her eligibility
decision. The rule would specify that actual control of the applicant concern must be in the hands of one or more socially
and economically disadvantaged individuals at the time the appropriate district Certification and Eligibility
Branch (C &amp; E Branch) determines that an application for the 8(a) program is complete. Potential control or the
power of disadvantaged individuals to change the applicant concern's Board of Directors or other aspects of control
so that the applicant concern 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
could be
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 controlled by disadvantaged individuals, no matter how easily exercised, would not satisfy the requirement that
the applicant be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
actually
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 controlled by disadvantaged individuals at the time the SBA district office C &amp; E Branch determines an application
to be complete. One reason to require actual control at the time that an applicant applies for admission to the 8(a)
program is to prevent ``front companies'' from being admitted to the 8(a) program. It is SBA's view that this potential
for abuse would be greatly lessened by the clarifications made in this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Section 626(a)(2) of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97&hyph;35, codified at 42 U.S.C.
9815(a)(2), required ``regulations to ensure the availability to community development corporations of such programs
as shall further the purposes of this subchapter, including programs under section [8(a) of the Small Business Act].''
The purpose of the subchapter referred to in this provision ``is to encourage the development of special programs
by which the residents of urban and rural low-income areas may, through self-help and mobilization of the community
at large, with appropriate Federal assistance, improve the quality of their economic and social participation in
community life in such a way as to contribute to the elimination of poverty and the establishment of permanent economic
and social benefits.'' 42 U.S.C. 9801. SBA has not heretofore implemented this authority through regulations. This
proposed rule would recognize participation of Community Development Corporations (CDCs) in the 8(a) program to
an extent that would not be inconsistent with the requirements of the 8(a) program imposed by the Small Business Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA believes that only CDC-owned or financed small business concerns can be eligible for the 8(a) program, and not
the CDC itself. This position is consistent with the Agency's longstanding regulations implementing the Small Business
Act that a small business must be a for-profit business entity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 13 CFR 121.403. Since CDCs are non-profit entities, they could not be considered small business concerns within the
meaning of the size regulations and, hence, would not be eligible for the 8(a) program on that basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is not intended to imply in any way that the basic requirement of the Small Business Act that 8(a) concerns
be owned by disadvantaged individuals can be administratively changed. Presently, two statutory exceptions to
this ownership requirement have been implemented in regulations. Subclauses 8(a)(4)(A)(i)(II) and (III) of the
Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)(A)(i)(II) and (III), statutorily extend 8(a) program eligibility to small
business concerns which are owned by either an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe, or a wholly owned business
entity of such a tribe, or a Native Hawaiian organization. These provisions have been implemented in 13 CFR &sect;&sect;124.112
and 124.113, respectively. The authority for extending eligibility for the 8(a) program to CDC-owned entities is
also statutory. Thus, similar to SBA's treatment of tribally-owned concerns and concerns owned by Native Hawaiian
organizations, this proposed rule recognizes CDC-owned concerns in accord with the authority set forth in 42 U.S.C.
9815(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to this proposed rule, SBA would consider CDCs comparable to Indian tribes. A CDC could have an ownership
interest in several business enterprises, just like an Indian tribe under current regulations. Where statute and
implementing regulations authorize a tribally-owned business concern to participate in the 8(a) program, but not
the tribe acting on its own behalf, SBA proposes that similar treatment be afforded CDCs and CDC-owned business concerns.
SBA also believes that the regulatorily created exclusion from affiliation that has been afforded tribally-owned
business concerns (i.e., one tribally-owned business is not considered affiliated with the tribe or other businesses
owned by the tribe merely because of common tribal ownership) should be extended to CDC-owned business concerns as
well (this proposal would also make that exclusion available to concerns owned by Native Hawaiian Organizations).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order for any CDC-owned business to participate in the 8(a) program, SBA would apply the basic management and control
requirements imposed by the Small Business Act for 8(a) program participation. Thus, the proposed rule would require
that CDC-owned applicant concerns must be managed by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would also make changes, as needed, in various other eligibility and 8(a) contracting requirements.
These changes are identified below in the section by section analysis of this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Section By Section Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a section by section analysis of each provision of SBA's regulations that would be affected by this
proposed rule:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 121.906(b)(1)(iv) and 121.1106(b)(1)(iv) would be amended to permit a small business non-manufacturer
to supply other than a product made in the United States for a small business set-aside or 8(a) contract where the procuring
agency makes a non-availability determination pursuant to &sect;25.102(a)(4) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
There has been some confusion as to whether a non-manufacturer could qualify as a small business if there was such a
non-availability determination under the Buy American Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulation. SBA did not intend
to exclude non-manufacturers from small business set-aside and 8(a) contracts where such a non-availability determination
has been made. This clarification should clear up any ambiguity in this area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121.1104 would be amended to impose its provisions on competitive as well as sole source 8(a) contracting
opportunities. Heretofore, this regulation was inconsistent with competitive contracting procedures. Other
minor changes for purposes of improved clarity would also be made to this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121.1703(b) would be amended to clarify that only the AA/MSB&amp;COD can appeal a Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) code assigned by a procuring agency contracting officer to either a sole source or a competitive 8(a) requirement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
discussion relating to proposed &sect;124.307(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.100 would be amended by adding definitions of the terms ``CDC-owned concern'', ``Clear and convincing
evidence'', and ``Community Development Corporation or CDC''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``Unconditional ownership'' in &sect;124.100 would be amended to explain that a disadvantaged
owner may use his/her ownership interest (e.g., stock) in an applicant or 8(a) concern as collateral for financing
during the normal course of business without affecting his/her ``unconditional'' ownership in such concern, provided
that complete control of the ownership interest remains with the disadvantaged owner absent any default in fulfilling
the terms of the financing. However, events of default must be defined in commercially reasonable ways. Events of
default beyond those that are deemed commercially reasonable could lead to a conclusion that unconditional ownership
is not in the hands of the disadvantaged owner. This clarification is not intended to require a concern to obtain financing
through a financial institution or to preclude, for example, seller-financed transactions. It is intended only
to permit financing terms that are reasonable within the marketplace. This change is essential to ensure that applicant
and 8(a) concerns have the flexibility they need to raise necessary capital. The requirement that disadvantaged
owners ``unconditionally'' own and control an applicant or 8(a) concern should not restrict a firm's ability to raise
capital under normal commercial terms and conditions to assist it in becoming viable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would eliminate the definitions for ``local buy'' and ``national buy'' requirements from &sect;124.100.
All requirements other than construction requirements would be open to eligible 8(a) Participants nationally.
To the extent possible, SBA seeks to lift restrictions that are otherwise not imposed in procurements conducted other
than through the 8(a) program. This would result in all eligible 8(a) concerns nationally being able to submit offers
in response to competitive 8(a) solicitations. In addition, a Program Participant could market and seek sole source
8(a) requirements nationally. Construction requirements would be exempt from this change because section 8(a)(11)
of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(11), requires, ``to the maximum extent practicable,'' that 8(a) construction
contracts ``be awarded within the county or State where the work is to be performed.'' The proposed rule would make
necessary changes in &sect;124.308(d), &sect;124.308(f), revised &sect;124.311(d), (old &sect;124.311(e)),
revised &sect;124.311(e) (old &sect;124.311(f)), and revised &sect;124.311(f) (old &sect;124.311(h)) to eliminate
the local and national buy concepts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would make minor technical changes to &sect;&sect;124.101(a), 124.101(b), 124.102(a), 124.103,
124.104, and 124.109(d) to recognize that CDC-owned concerns would be eligible for participation in the 8(a) program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 124.101(a), 124.104 and 124.206(a) would be amended to clarify that the AA/MSB&amp;COD's decision to approve
or decline an application for 8(a) program participation would be based on whether the applicant concern complied
with each of SBA's eligibility criteria at the time the concern's completed application for admission to the 8(a)
program is sent to the Office of MSB&amp;COD for processing or, in the case of a request for reconsideration, at the
time the reconsideration application is deemed to be complete by SBA's Central Office. A change in circumstances
submitted by an applicant concern subsequent to the date that an application or reconsideration action is sent to
the Office of MSB&amp;COD for processing would not be considered, unless it causes a loss of eligibility. The structure
of the concern, including all necessary corporate formalities, would have to be in place prior to the Office of MSB&amp;COD's
processing of an application or request for reconsideration. A disadvantaged individual's ability to immediately
change the applicant's structure or effect a change in its control so that actual control of the concern is in the hands
of disadvantaged individuals and/or other eligibility criteria are met would not satisfy the requirement that they
be met at the time of the completed application. The rule would specify, however, that SBA, in its sole discretion,
could request clarification of information contained in the application at any stage in the application process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The decision of the AA/MSB&amp;COD to approve or decline an application for 8(a) program admission would then be based
on whether the application, as clarified by any information submitted in response to a request by SBA, demonstrates
that the applicant concern complies with each of SBA's eligibility criteria. While SBA would be able to request and
consider additional information in processing an 8(a) application, SBA would not consider information gratuitously
submitted by an applicant concern after it submits its application. This clarification is needed to streamline the
application process and ensure that SBA meets its statutorily imposed time limitation for processing applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.103 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (a) that would require direct ownership of 8(a) applicants
or Program Participants by disadvantaged 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
individuals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This statutory requirement is currently set forth in &sect;124.109, but SBA believes that it should be added to this
section for clarification purposes. Present &sect;&sect;124.103(a) through (j) would be redesignated to become
&sect;&sect;124.103(b) through (k). Sections 124.109(d) and (e) would be similarly amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newly redesignated &sect;124.103(i) (old &sect;124.103(h)) would be amended to permit a former Program Participant
to have an equity ownership interest of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business.
Such a requirement would increase an 8(a) concern's ability to raise capital, while continuing to advance the economic
viability of a former Program Participant after its 8(a) program term has expired. Section &sect;124.104(c)(2)
would also be amended to permit the principal of a former Program Participant to have an equity ownership interest
of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business as the former Program Participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newly redesignated &sect;124.103(j) (old &sect;124.103(i)) would be amended to make clear that an 8(a) concern
may substitute one disadvantaged individual for another without invoking the termination for convenience/waiver
provision of &sect;124.317 of these regulations with respect to any 8(a) contracts that it has been awarded on or after
June 1, 1989. Provided program eligibility is maintained and SBA approves a substitution of one disadvantaged individual
for another, performance of 8(a) contracts already received could continue without seeking a waiver under &sect;124.317.
SBA believes that the statutory termination for convenience/waiver provision did not intend to prohibit the performance
of an 8(a) contract by the 8(a) concern that initially received it simply where there has been one or more approved changes
of particular individuals upon whom eligibility of the concern was based. This change is necessary to apprise procuring
agencies and 8(a) concerns that termination of 8(a) contracts is not required in such instances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;124.103(l), SBA would aggregate the ownership interests of a business concern and its
principal(s) in determining whether a non-disadvantaged individual or business concern exceeds the 10 percent
equity ownership limitations (or, in the case of a former Program Participant, the 20 percent equity ownership limitations)
established by &sect;&sect;124.103 and 124.104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would also add a new &sect;124.103(m), dealing with the applicability of state community property
laws on the respective ownership interests in an applicant concern or a Program Participant once admitted to the Program.
This revision would not be a change in SBA policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.104(a) would be reorganized for greater clarity and easier use. Of particular note, &sect;124.104(a)
would be amended to specify that one or more disadvantaged individuals who are determined to manage the applicant
or 8(a) concern must be physically located at the offices of the applicant or 8(a) concern be open during the normal
40-hour work week of most business concerns. Thus, this proposed provision would require that the disadvantaged
individual(s) be present at the location of the applicant or 8(a) concern during those hours and not, for example,
only at night or on the weekends. This rule does not imply that business activities of the applicant or 8(a) concern
could not be conducted by such individual(s) outside the offices of the applicant or 8(a) concern, nor does it prohibit
a disadvantaged individual from establishing an 8(a) concern at his/her home. It is meant to ensure only that one or
more disadvantaged owners devote full-time to the business of the applicant or 8(a) concern. Under this proposed
amendment, SBA would not permit an individual to be physically located at a job which is separate and distinct from
the applicant or 8(a) concern during normal business hours and claim that he/she is managing the applicant or 8(a)
concern from that location.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.104(b) would be amended along the lines set forth above for &sect;&sect;124.101(a), 124,104 and 124.206(a).
This amended paragraph would specify that the Board of Directors must actually be controlled by disadvantaged individuals.
The power of a disadvantaged individual to control the Board of Directors indirectly through his/her right to vote
his/her stock (i.e., the power to remove and replace directors) would not be sufficient to establish control of the
Board of Directors if non-disadvantaged individuals on the Board of Directors could control, or assert negative
control on, the Board as currently structured at the time of the application for admission to the 8(a) program. This
paragraph would also provide that non-voting, advisory or honorary Directors may be appointed so long as they do not
possess negative control over the Board. Similarly, a separate board of advisors, particularly in the context of
tribally-owned applicants and 8(a) concerns, could be established provided such board of advisors could not actually
run the day-to-day operations of or possess negative control over the applicant or 8(a) business concern.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating whether an individual's social disadvantage has negatively impacted on his or her entry into and/or
advancement in the business world, &sect;124.105(c) would be amended to clarify that SBA will entertain any relevant
evidence, but that SBA would consider the experiences of the individual, where applicable, in education, employment
and business history. The failure to establish disadvantage in any one area (i.e., education, employment, or business
history) would not prevent an individual from meeting this requirement of negative impact as long as the totality
of the circumstances experienced by the individual demonstrate his/her disadvantage in entering into and/or advancing
in the business world.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.106(a)(2)(i) would be amended by increasing the entry level personal net worth limitation from $250,000
to $300,000 in order to take into account inflation. The $250,000 net worth figure was established by regulation in
April 1989. Inflation increased 19.6 percent between April 1989 and March 1994 based on the Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers. Applying the 19.6 percent inflation rate to the $250,000 figure would increase the net worth
limitation to $299,000. This proposed rule would round that amount to $300,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.106(a)(2)(ii) would clarify SBA's method of analysis in determining whether the applicant concern
itself, as apart from its disadvantaged owner(s), should be considered economically disadvantaged. It would require
SBA to compare an applicant concern to other small business concerns in the same four-digit Standard Industrial Classification
Code which are not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.106(a)(2)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) would be amended to provide that assets transferred by an individual claiming disadvantaged status to any immediate
family member within two years prior to the date of application to the 8(a) program shall be presumed to be the property
of the individual claiming disadvantaged status. Currently, property or assets transferred by an individual claiming
disadvantaged status to his/her spouse within two years of the date of 8(a) application is presumed to be the property
of the transferor for purposes of determining his/her economic disadvantage. SBA believes that a change is needed
to prevent circumvention of its eligibility regulations by asset transfers to other than an applicant individual's
spouse. Several applicants have avoided the intent of this regulation by transferring assets to children. SBA believes
that it is necessary to prevent the recurrence of this practice, which if left unchanged, could admit firms into the
8(a) program that SBA believes should be considered ineligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.106(b) would be amended for clarity, and would increase the personal net worth limitation for the Small
Disadvantaged Business program from $750,000 to $900,000 to take into account inflation since the $750,000 standard
was set in April 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.107(b) would be amended to clarify that the requirement that an applicant concern possess technical
and managerial experience to be deemed to have the required potential for success to be admitted to the 8(a) program
was not meant to contradict the provision in &sect;124.104 that the individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based
need not posses both management and technical capabilities. In order to have the requisite potential for success,
an applicant concern must have both management and technical experience. Conversely, the individual(s) upon whom
eligibility is based must possess either management or technical capabilities to meet that part of the control requirement
under &sect;124.104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.108 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (d)(3) that would state that any 8(a) applicant that is a
dealer or wholesaler would not be required to demonstrate that it is capable of supplying the product of a small business
manufacturer in conjunction with its 8(a) application. In the past, there has been confusion as to whether SBA's non-manufacturer
rule (i.e., the rule requiring a regular dealer to supply the product of a small business in order for it to be considered
small for a specific 8(a) or small business set aside procurement) should be applied in determining an applicant's
initial eligibility for the 8(a) program. SBA believes that because the Small Business Act authorizes waivers to
the non-manufacturer rule in connection with a specific contract where SBA determines that no small business manufacturer
can reasonably be expected to offer a product meeting the specifications of the solicitation, the non-manufacturer
rule should have no bearing on an applicant's eligibility for the 8(a) program. In addition, the 8(a) program should
not be viewed solely as a contracting program. There is other business development assistance available to Program
Participants which should not be foreclosed because of the non-manufacturer rule. Regular dealer applicants to
the 8(a) program should be aware, however, that they must generally meet the requirements of the non-manufacturer
rule in order to be awarded specific 8(a) contracts as regular dealers.

Proposed &sect;124.109(f) would add a provision making an applicant to the 8(a) program ineligible for program participation
if the proprietor, or a holder of at least 20 percent of the stock, or a partner, officer, director of the concern is currently
incarcerated, on parole or on probation. This provision is derived from a similar determination of ineligibility
for SBA financial assistance currently contained in 13 CFR 120.101&hyph;2(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.111 would be amended by revising paragraph (a)(2) to set the same personal net worth limitation for a Program
Participant in either the developmental or transitional stage of program participation to maintain its continued
8(a) eligibility. Currently, the limit is $500,000 for firms in the developmental stage of 8(a) program participation,
$750,000 for firms in the transitional stage of 8(a) program participation, and $750,000 for purposes of eligibility
for the Department of Defense's Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) program. This rule would eliminate the separate
net worth figure for firms in the developmental stage (i.e., eliminating the current $500,000 amount). It would then
apply the $750,000 amount, adjusted for inflation, to all participant firms to make the requirement for developmental
firms consistent with continued eligibility for transitional firms and simplify program administration. As with
the entry level personal net worth limitation amount, the $750,000 figure would also be increased by 19.6 percent
due to inflation (

 discussion relating to proposed &sect;124.106(a)(2)(i)). A straight inflation adjustment would produce a net
worth limitation of $897,000. This proposed rule would round that amount to $900,000.

Section 124.111(c)(5) would be amended to further restrict excessive withdrawals from 8(a) Program Participants
by their owners or managers. Specifically, a Participant could no longer claim that large withdrawals from the Participant
should not be restricted where the concern's net worth has continued to increase throughout the period of time the
withdrawals are made. Certain Program Participants have attempted to claim that excessive withdrawals could not
be penalized where the Participant's net worth continued to increase because the withdrawals were not detrimental
to the attainment of its business plan. The 8(a) program is designed to foster the development of business concerns
owned by disadvantaged individuals. The fact that Participant's net worth has increased does not mean that it would
not have increased more or achieved greater success but for excessive withdrawals by its owners/managers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.112(c)(2)(iv) would be amended to clarify the requirements pertaining to a joint venture between an
8(a) concern owned by an Indian tribe and a concern determined to be other than small. There has been some concern that
this regulation required a majority of the performance of such a contract to be performed on an Indian reservation
or land owned by the tribe. This was not the intent. This proposed rule would amend this provision to make it consistent
with the same provision contained in &sect;124.321 which requires only that the tribally-owned 8(a) concern must
perform most of its activities generally on the reservation or tribally-owned land in order to be eligible to joint
venture with a large business. This provision contains no specific requirement that the work done through the joint
venture must be done on the Indian reservation or tribally-owned land. However, it is necessary not to overlook two
requirements which may perpetuate that requirement in some instances_that the concern must be located on the reservation
or tribally-owned land, and that the 8(a) participant to a joint venture must meet the performance of work requirements
imposed by &sect;124.314.

Section 124.113 would be amended by adding an exclusion from affiliation for concerns owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization,
by prohibiting a Native Hawaiian Organization from owning more than one current or former 8(a) Participant having
the same primary industry classification, and by excluding from the one-time individual eligibility requirement
any individual who merely manages a concern owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would add a new &sect;124.114 which would specifically authorize CDC-owned small business concerns
to participate in the 8(a) program. The same amendments added to &sect;124.113 for Native Hawaiian Organizations
would be added to this section regarding CDC-owned concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minor clarifying language would be added to &sect;124.206(c)(1) regarding the time frame for an applicant concern
to request a reconsideration, and where such a request must be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 124.208(c) and 124.209(b) would be amended to streamline the procedures governing graduation and termination
of 8(a) Program Participants respectively. This rule would eliminate the second letter of notification and the second
45 day response period provided in &sect;124.208(c) and &sect;124.209(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this rule would change the time period in which the Division Director must make a recommendation on
graduation to the AA/MSB&amp;COD. The rule would change the time frame for the Division Director's recommendation
to the AA/MSB&amp;COD from 15 days to 45 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.209(b) currently provides the same procedures and time limits regarding termination actions as are
discussed above with regard to graduation from the 8(a) program. This rule would make the same changes to the termination
procedures as are discussed above with regard to graduation from the 8(a) program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would amend the procedures concerning remands of 8(a) eligibility appeals by OHA to the AA/MSB&amp;COD.
Section 124.210(h)(2) would clarify that the AA/MSB&amp;COD would issue a decision in accordance with a remand order
of the Administrative Law Judge within 10 working days of the remand, unless the AA/MSB&amp;COD requests and the Administrative
Law Judge grants an extension thereof. An applicant or 8(a) concern could then appeal the AA/MSB&amp;COD's remand
decision to OHA within 20 working days of the date that the decision is mailed. The failure of an applicant to file an
appeal within the 20-day time frame would serve to make the remand decision the final agency decision and would not
require any further action by OHA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.210 would be further amended by adding a new paragraph (k) to specifically authorize reconsideration
of 8(a) eligibility appeal decisions made by SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals. Reconsideration would be specifically
authorized where a petitioning party establishes a clear error of law or fact affecting the decision in the case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.302 would be amended to ease the restrictions on adding SIC codes once a concern is admitted to the 8(a)
program. The proposed rule would permit SBA to approve an additional SIC code as long as a rational business explanation
exists for acquiring the requested SIC code. SBA seeks to make it clear that the authority to make decisions regarding
what types of business ventures an 8(a) concern should get involved in rests with the 8(a) concerns themselves. Thus,
for example, an 8(a) concern may acquire or develop the capability to perform contracts in an industry not directly
related to the 8(a) concern's primary business and seek to add the appropriate SIC code(s), or it may hire an additional
key employee that opens up new avenues of work to the 8(a) concern and seek to add additional SIC codes. In addition,
SBA proposes to shorten the time it takes SBA to respond to a request for a change in SIC code designations from 45 days
to 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would amend &sect;124.305(b)(3) regarding what a Program Participant must demonstrate to qualify
for an 8(a) bond exemption. As currently written, in order to qualify for a bond exemption, an 8(a) Program Participant
must, among other things, demonstrate that it cannot obtain a bond for the performance of the specific 8(a) requirement
at issued by submitting to SBA written denials from at least two sureties, one of which is a corporate surety and one
of which is an individual surety. Based on experience with this provision, SBA believes that the requirement that
two sureties decline to issue the required bond is unnecessary. As such, the proposed rule would amend &sect;124.305(b)(3)
to require a Participant to demonstrate only that it cannot obtain a bond from one corporate (Treasury-listed) surety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would revise &sect;124.305(c)(4) to provide that a Program Participant may be eligible to receive
only two bond exemptions at any one time. In other words, although up to five bond exemptions per Program Participant
are authorized, a Participant may not have more than two active 8(a) contracts at a time for which it has received a bond
exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would also eliminate the requirement that a Program Participant not be permitted to receive 8(a)
contracts in excess of its approved 8(a) support level. However, this would not affect SBA's authority to impose a
limit on the amount of 8(a) contract awards as a part of a remedial action plan where a firm fails to meet its competitive
business mix requirements. A concern would still be required to project in its business plan its anticipated level
of 8(a) contract support, but such level would be used only as a planning and development tool. Section 124.307 would
be amended by redesignating paragraph ``(d)'' as paragraph ``(e)'' and by adding a new paragraph ``(d)'' that would
eliminate approved 8(a) support levels as a basis for denying 8(a) contract awards in excess of those levels. SBA believes
that Program Participants should be afforded the flexibility to seek out and receive 8(a) contracts so long as they
are capable and responsible to perform those contracts and meet their competitive business mix requirements. SBA
would still determine whether a Participant was responsible to perform a particular 8(a) procurement requirement,
and could determine that the concern did not have the capacity to perform the extra work, but, except as part of an approved
remedial action plan, it could not withhold award merely because the concern would exceed (or has exceeded) its approved
support level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.307 would be further amended by adding a new paragraph ``(f)'' that would prohibit any party from challenging
the eligibility of a Program Participant for a specific sole source or competitive 8(a) requirement at SBA or any other
administrative forum. Much of this provision is currently contained in &sect;124.311(g) for competitive 8(a) requirements,
but no such specific language was set forth for sole source 8(a) requirements. The regulatory language appearing
in &sect;124.311(g) would be moved into this new provision and would be expanded to apply to sole source 8(a) procurements
as well. Section 124.311(g) would be removed as unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed rule would specify that only the AA/MSB&amp;COD could file a SIC code appeal in connection
with either a sole source or competitive 8(a) requirement. While this restriction appears in &sect;121.1703, as
part of SBA's size and SIC code appeal regulations, it was not similarly contained in the 8(a) regulations. SBA believes
that it should appear in both places for clarity and ease of use. It would specifically apply to both sole source and
competitive 8(a) requirements. SBA reviews every SIC code to determine its appropriateness, but so long as the code
assigned by the procuring agency contracting officer is reasonable, SBA will concur. SBA frequently goes back to
a procuring agency to dispute a SIC code when it feels that the statement of work indicates that the assigned SIC code
is inappropriate. Discussions between SBA and the procuring agency normally clear up any confusion. As part of this
process, any party may submit evidence to SBA to explain why it believes another SIC code should be assigned to the procurement.
SBA will consider such information and will seek a SIC code change if it believes that the SIC code assigned by the procuring
agency is unreasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.308(c) would be amended to specify where 8(a) offerings should be sent in light of the changes made by this
rule eliminating local and national buy requirements. Under the proposed rule, all requirements that are offered
to the 8(a) program as competitive procurements and those sole source requirements that are offered to the program
without nominating a specific Program Participant (i.e., open requirements) would be offered to SBA's Division
of Program Development in SBA's Central Office. Sole source requirements that are offered to the 8(a) program on behalf
of a specific Program Participant would be offered to the appropriate SBA district office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.308(d) would be amended to clarify the distinction between accepting a competitive 8(a) requirement
on behalf of the 8(a) program generally and a sole source 8(a) requirement on behalf of a particular 8(a) Program Participant.
In addition, the proposed rule would prohibit a procuring agency from conducting a competitive 8(a) requirement
prior to obtaining SBA's acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) program. Any competition so held would not be considered
an 8(a) competition. If a procuring agency still wanted to fulfill its requirement through the 8(a) program, the requirement
would have to be offered to and accepted by SBA for the 8(a) program, and the procuring agency would have to use applicable
8(a) competitive procedures after the acceptance. The procuring agency would again be required to synopsize the
procurement in the Commerce Business Daily. A new solicitation would have to be issued, and new offers would have to
be submitted and evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.308 would also be amended, by adding a paragraph (d)(4), to permit all eligible 8(a) concerns nationally
to submit offers in connection with 8(a) competitive requirements other than construction requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 124.308(e)(1)(iii), 124.311(f)(4), 124.311(f)(5), 124.312(b), and 124.312(c) would be amended by removing
any provisions pertaining to 8(a) support level requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule would add a new &sect;124.308(i) pertaining to Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs). This provision would state
that each order to be issued under a BOA, and not the BOA itself, is a contracting action. As such, there must be a separate
offer and acceptance for each order. As with any other new offer, SBA would determine eligibility for an order under
a BOA at the time of the issuance of the order. This would require a concern to remain a small business at the time the order
is to be issued and would prohibit orders from being issued to concerns whose program terms have expired or who have
otherwise exited the 8(a) program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.309(c) would be amended to clarify SBA's intent regarding the concept of adverse impact. Under the proposed
rule, ``adverse impact'' could be found to exist where several requirements currently being performed by different
small business concerns are bundled into one larger requirement which could be considered ``new'' under SBA's regulations
due to the magnitude of the bundled requirement. This rule would permit SBA to find adverse impact in such a case where
at least one of the small business concerns losing work that is to be bundles meets the presumption of adverse impact.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule also proposes to amend &sect;124.311(a) concerning how the competitive threshold requirements should
be applied for indefinite quantity and indefinite delivery requirements. Currently, &sect;124.311(a)(2) specifies
that ``[f]or purposes of indefinite quantity/delivery contracts, the thresholds will be applied to the guaranteed
minimum value of the contract.'' This requirement has proven unworkable because of the immense differences noted
between the ``guaranteed minimum'' amounts on procurements offered to the 8(a) program and the maximum amounts authorized
under the procurements, and has been subject to substantial criticism. Procuring agencies can presently offer very
large procurement requirements to the 8(a) program as indefinite quantity type requirements with guaranteed minimum
amounts below the applicable 8(a) competitive threshold in order for contracts to be procured on a sole source basis,
even though the procurement would likely exceed the applicable competitive threshold during the performance of
the contract. Requirements that traditionally were procured through other contract types were being offered and
accepted into the 8(a) program as indefinite quantity requirements solely to take advantage of the guaranteed minimum
rule. In order to eliminate this potential abuse, SBA proposes to amend its regulations to specify that the competitive
threshold requirements would be applied for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 types of contracts, including indefinite quantity/delivery contracts, to the Government estimate of the requirement,
including options, as identified by the procuring agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would amend newly redesignated &sect;&sect;124.311(d), (f) and (g) (old &sect;&sect;124.311(e),
(h), and (i)) to take into account the proposed change made in &sect;124.308(d)(4) that would permit all eligible
Program Participants nationally to submit offers in response to 8(a) competitive solicitations, other than for
construction requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed redesignated &sect;124.311(g) (old &sect;124.311(i)) would clarify SBA's implementation of &sect;8(a)(1)(C)
of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(1)(C), which authorizes competitive 8(a) awards in limited circumstances
to firms which have completed their terms of participation in the 8(a) program. Of particular note, SBA would specify
in the regulations that eligibility would be determined as of the initial date specified for the receipt of offers
set forth in the solicitation without regard to extensions of time through amendments to the solicitation. The date
for determining eligibility would thus be firmly established and could not change during the procurement process.
With such a date certain, firms know up front if their program term will expire prior to that specified date. Offers
would not be prepared amid uncertainty that the date for determining eligibility could be changed. As such, firms
would not be dissuaded from participating in 8(a) competitive procurements during the later stages of their participation
terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.317 would be amended to specify that only physical or mental incapacity, and not criminal incarceration
or bankruptcy, could be a basis for a waiver of the termination for convenience requirement imposed by this section.
In addition, this section would be amended to make clear that the burden is on the concern requesting a waiver to specify
the ground(s) upon which the waiver is being sought and to demonstrate that it has met the ground(s). The Agency is not
expected to raise every possible basis for waiver and to then dismiss them as not applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would add a new &sect;124.319(c). This provision would clarify that SBA may novate one 8(a) Program
Participant for another (with the consent of the procuring agency) where the first concern cannot complete performance
of an 8(a) contract, without seeking the approval of the Administrator under &sect;124.317.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.321(a) would be amended to clarify that an 8(a) concern seeking to joint venture with another firm must
bring something of value to the joint venture arrangement other than its status as an 8(a) concern. While the regulation
would continue to state that a joint venture agreement is permissible only where an 8(a) concern lacks the necessary
capacity to perform the contract on its own, it would specify for the first time that where the 8(a) concern lacks the
management, technical 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
financial capacity to perform, a joint venture will not be approved. An 8(a) concern may be lacking in one or even two
of these areas, but cannot be totally reliant on its proposed joint venture partner. The purpose of permitting joint
ventures is to enable an 8(a) firm to gain experience and know-how so that it can become self-reliant in the future.
If all an 8(a) concern will gain from the relationship is a profit, without developing its own capabilities in any way,
the joint venture will not be approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;124.321(c)(3) would clarify that a joint venture can be made up of two or more 8(a) concerns without
any one firm receiving at least 51 percent of the net profits earned by the joint venture. In particular, a 50/50 joint
venture arrangement between two 8(a) concerns would be expressly authorized, provided the other regulatory requirements
were met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule would make minor clarification changes in &sect;124.321(d) to recognize the possibility of a joint venture
made up of two or more 8(a) concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new &sect;124.321(i) would establish criteria relating to joint ventures for Small Disadvantaged Business
(SDB) set-asides and SDB evaluation preferences. In the past, SBA has held the position that SBA could not establish
eligibility criteria relating to joint ventures for the Department of Defense's SDB program. A recent decision by
the United States Court of Federal Claims held that ``the power to interpret the term small business concerns .&blank;.&blank;.
owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals [for purposes of DOD's SDB program]
is wholly and exclusively within the sphere of SBA's authority,'' and that ``SBA has both the power and the duty to define
the bounds of [that] phrase.''

No. 93&hyph;738 at 10, 11 (Fed.Cl. Feb. 18, 1994). This proposed rule attempts to implement that authority in a way
that is consistent with the purposes of the SDB program. While the rules vary somewhat from those pertaining to joint
ventures in the 8(a) program, the developmental purposes of the 8(a) program are not totally consistent with the purposes
of the SDB program. In addition, the rule applies the statutory requirement that the ``majority of the earnings of
[an SDB contract] directly accrue to [disadvantaged] individuals.'' Pub. L. 99&hyph;661, Sec. 1207(a)(1). Therefore,
although an 8(a) concern that is 51 percent owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals can joint venture with
a 100 percent nondisadvantaged concern for a particular 8(a) contract (provided the 8(a) joint venture requirements
are met), an SDB concern that is 51 percent owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals cannot joint venture
with a 100 percent nondisadvantaged concern for a particular SDB contract. In such a case, a majority of the earnings
of the SDB contract could not accrue directly to disadvantaged individuals.

Section 124.501 would be amended by adding a new paragraph ``(c)'' and redesignating current paragraph ``(c)'' as

. This rule is necessary to resolve several points relating to eligibility for SBA's Section 8(a) program and the procedures
relating to appeals of denials of eligibility. It would also clarify/amend the requirements by which an 8(a) concern
could obtain an exemption to the Miller Act bond requirements. The contracting opportunities offered to the 8(a)
program should not be affected by this proposed rule. Whether a particular 8(a) concern would be eligible for participation
in or, once in, could receive a bond exemption (and, therefore, whether it, as opposed to another 8(a) concern, would
be awarded a particular 8(a) contract) could be affected by the rule. The rule would have no effect, however, on the
amount or dollar value of any contract requirement or the number of such requirements reserved for the 8(a) program.
Therefore, it is not likely to have an annual economic effect of $100 million or more, result in a major increase in costs
or prices, or have a significant adverse effect on competition or the United States economy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) After SBA has notified a procuring agency in writing that it has accepted a requirement for the 8(a) program,
the 8(a) concern shall certify that it is a small business for the purpose of performing that particular contract (by
certifying that it is small with respect to the size standard corresponding to the SIC code assigned to the requirement)
at the time it submits its initial offer including price to the procuring agency for that contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Size certifications occurring prior to SBA's acceptance of a requirement for the 8(a) program shall have no effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Where a procuring agency conducts an 8(a) competition without first obtaining SBA's acceptance of the requirement
for the 8(a) program, any size certification made in response to the solicitation issued by the procuring agency shall
have no effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where a procuring agency negotiates directly with an 8(a) Program Participant for a sole source 8(a) requirement,
any size certification occurring prior to SBA's acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) program shall have no effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Once a procuring agency has determined that award of a sole source or competitive contract should be made to a particular
8(a) Program Participant, SBA shall verify that the selected concern is small as of the date of its initial offer including
price.

to the concern's self-certification (i.e., changes occurring between the date of certification and the date of award),
except those due to merger with or acquisition by another business concern, will not affect the concern's size status
as it relates to that procurement.

a sole source 8(a) requirement, may accept the procurement in support of another 8(a) concern, or may return the procurement
from the 8(a) program, as appropriate, or (2) in connection with a competitive 8(a) requirement, shall notify the

 The 8(a) program: General eligibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In order to be eligible to participate in the 8(a) program, an applicant concern and an individual upon whom eligibility
is based must meet all of the eligibility criteria set forth in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109. An applicant
concern owned and controlled by an Indian tribe must meet the requirements set forth in &sect;124.112 and in &sect;&sect;124.102
through 124.109 as applicable. An applicant concern owned and controlled by a Native Hawaiian Organization must
meet the requirements set forth in &sect;124.113 and in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109 as applicable. An applicant
concern owned and controlled by a Community Development Corporation must meet the requirements set forth in &sect;124.114
and in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109 as applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An applicant concern's eligibility will be based on whether the concern meets each of SBA's eligibility criteria
at the time the concern's completed application for admission to the 8(a) program is sent to the Office of MSB&amp;COD
for processing or, in the case of a request for reconsideration, at the time the reconsideration application is deemed
to be complete by SBA's Central Office. SBA, in its sole discretion, may, however, request clarification of information
contained in the application or request for reconsideration at any time in the application process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) SBA will consider only additional information submitted by an applicant in response to an SBA request for clarification.
Changes in an applicant concern that SBA becomes aware of between the date of application (or request for reconsideration)
and the decision of the AA/MSB&amp;COD that adversely affect the applicant's eligibility for 8(a) program participation
will be considered and constitute grounds for decline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The decision of the AA/MSB&amp;COD to approve or decline an application for 8(a) program admission shall be based
on whether the application, as clarified by any information submitted in response to a request by SBA, demonstrates
that the applicant concern complies with each of SBA's eligibility criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All determinations made by the AA/MSB&amp;COD concerning the eligibility of an applicant concern for participation
in the 8(a) program shall be in writing, setting forth the findings based on relevant facts and in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An applicant concern which is declined 8(a) program admission may request a reconsideration of such decline,
as set forth in &sect;124.206.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the application is declined on reconsideration based solely on a negative finding of social disadvantage,
economic disadvantage, ownership or control, such decline may be appealed by an unsuccessful applicant to the SBA's
Office of Hearings and Appeals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If no reconsideration is sought, or if after reconsideration the application is declined based in whole or in
part on a ground other than a negative finding of social disadvantage, economic disadvantage, ownership or control,
the written decline of the AA/MSB&amp;COD is final and not subject to appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The procedures by which an applicant concern may appeal the AA/MSB&amp;COD's denial of 8(a) program admission
to SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals, and the grounds for which such an appeal may be brought, are set forth in &sect;124.210
and part 134 of this title. Where such an appeal is brought, the written decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals
shall be the final Agency decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A concern which has been declined for 8(a) program admission must wait at least 12 months from the date of the final
Agency decision before it can reapply for program admission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In order to continue its participation in the 8(a) program, a Program Participant must continue to meet all eligibility
requirements described in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109, &sect;124.111(a), and &sect;124.112, &sect;124.113

an applicant concern must be at least 51 percent unconditionally owned by an individual(s) who is a citizen of the United
States (specifically excluding permanent resident alien(s)) and who is determined by SBA to be socially and economically
disadvantaged. Special ownership requirements for concerns owned by Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations

(g) The individuals determined to be disadvantaged in one 8(a) concern, their immediate family members residing
in the same household, and the 8(a) concern itself may not hold, in the aggregate, more than a 10 percent equity ownership
interest in any other single 8(a) concern.

(h) *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A non-8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business is prohibited from having an equity ownership interest
in an 8(a) concern which exceeds 10 percent, except that a former Program Participant may have an equity ownership
interest of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business. *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) *&blank;*&blank;* While SBA approval must be obtained, the substitution of one disadvantaged individual for
another disadvantaged individual within an 8(a) concern that was awarded one or more 8(a) contracts does not require
termination of those contracts under &sect;124.317 of these regulations or a request for waiver of that termination
requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) The ownership interests of business concern and its principal(s) are considered to be aggregated in determining
whether a non-disadvantaged individual or business concern exceeds the 10 percent equity ownership limitations
(or, in the case of a former Program Participant, the 20 percent equity ownership limitations) established by this
section and &sect;124.104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) In determining the respective ownership interests in an applicant concern, or in a Program Participant once admitted
to the program, SBA considers applicable state community property laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In a community property state, even when only one spouse's name appears on a document of title or stock certificate,
both spouses are considered to have one-half interest in that property as long as the property is acquired, earned,
or accumulated during the course of the marriage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If SBA determines that the stock or assets of an 8(a) applicant concern are held as community property, and if only
one spouse demonstrates disadvantaged status, SBA shall require as a condition of demonstrating or maintaining
eligibility, the transfer by the non-disadvantaged spouse or his/her ownership interest to the disadvantaged spouse.
Such a transfer must be in an amount sufficient for the disadvantaged spouse to meet the minimum 51% unconditional
ownership requirement for 8(a) program eligibility.

 Title to 8(a) applicant concern A is 100% in the name of Mrs. X (an individual determined to be socially and economically
disadvantaged). Mr. X is a non-disadvantaged individual. Mr. and Mrs. X reside in a community property state and concern
A is determined to be community property. By operation of law, Mr. X is deemed to own 50% of concern A. In order to meet
8(a) eligibility requirements, Mr. X would have to transfer 1% of his interest in concern A to Mrs. X as non-community
property.

 Title to 8(a) applicant B is 51% in the name of Mr. Y (an individual determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged)
and 49% in Mr. Z (an unmarried non-disadvantaged individual). Mrs. Y is a non-disadvantaged individual. Mr. and Mrs.
Y reside in a community property state and concern B is determined to be community property. By operation of law, Mrs.
Y is deemed to own 25.5% of concern B. In order to meet 8(a) eligibility requirements, Mrs. Y would have to transfer all
25.5% of her interest in concern B to Mr. Y as non-community property.

14. Section 124.104 would be amended by revising the introductory text, paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4), paragraph
(b), the introductory text of paragraph (c), paragraph (c)(2), and paragraph (d)(3) to read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;124.104

Control and management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except for concerns owned by Indian tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, Native Hawaiian Organizations, or Community
Development Corporations, as defined in &sect;124.100, an applicant concern's management and daily business operations
must be conducted by an owner(s) of the applicant concern who has (have) been determined to be socially and economically
disadvantaged. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 &sect;124.112 for the requirements for tribally-owned entities and those owned by ANCs). In the case of an applicant
concern owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization, the concern's management and daily business operations must be
conducted by one or more Native Hawaiian individuals. In the case of a concern owned by a Community Development Corporation,
the concern's management and daily business operations must be conducted by one or more individuals determined to
be socially and economically disadvantaged. In order for a disadvantaged individual to be found to control the concern,
that individual must have managerial or technical experience and competency directly related to the primary industry
in which the applicant concern is seeking certification. The application must demonstrate that the applicant concern
is actually controlled and managed by one or more individuals determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged.
A disadvantaged individual's unexercised right to cause a change in the control or management of the applicant concern
does not satisfy this requirement, regardless of how quickly or easily the right could be exercised.

(2) An economically disadvantaged full-time manager must hold the position of President or Chief Executive Officer

(3) One or more disadvantaged individuals determined to manage the applicant or 8(a) concern on a full-time basis
must be present and available during normal working hours at the place of business of the applicant or 8(a) concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any disadvantaged individual upon whom 8(a) eligibility is based who is engaged in the management and daily business
operations of the 8(a) concern and who wishes to engage in outside employment must notify SBA of the nature and anticipated
duration of the outside employment and obtain the written approval of SBA prior to engaging in such employment. SBA
will review any request for outside employment for compliance with the requirement of day-to-day management and
control of the 8(a) concern. SBA will deny a request for outside employment which could conflict with the management
of the firm or could hinder it in achieving the objectives of its business development plan.

(b) The socially and economically disadvantaged individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based shall control the
Board of Directors of an applicant or 8(a) concern, either in actual numbers of voting directors or through weighted
voting (e.g., in a concern having a two-person Board of Directors where one individual on the Board is disadvantaged
and one is not, the disadvantaged vote must be weighted_worth more than one vote_in order for the concern to be eligible
for 8(a) participation).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The powers to appoint, remove, and replace directors (e.g., through ownership of voting stock) is not sufficient
to satisfy the requirement that one or more disadvantaged individuals actually control the Board of Directors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Non-voting, advisory, or honorary Directors may be appointed without affecting the control of the applicant
or 8(a) concern to allow the firm to have a varied and experienced Board of Directors, provided they cannot negatively
control the concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) All arrangements regarding the structure and voting rights of the Board of Directors must comply with applicable
state law.

(c) Individuals who are not socially and economically disadvantaged may be involved in the management of an 8(a) applicant
concern, and may be stockholders, partners, officers, and/or directors of such concern. Such partners, officers,
directors, and/or more than 10 percent stockholders of the applicant concern, their spouses or immediate family
members who reside in the individual's household may not however:

of this section must establish his/her individual social disadvantage on the basis of clear and convincing evidence.

(v) The individual's social disadvantage must have negatively impacted on his or her entry into and/or advancement
in the business world. SBA will entertain any relevant evidence in assessing this element. In every case, however,
SBA will consider the experiences of the individual, where applicable, in education, employment and business history.
Failure to establish disadvantage in any one of these components will not prevent an individual from meeting this
requirement as long as the totality of the circumstances experienced by the individual demonstrates his/her disadvantage
in entering into and/or advancing in the business world.

Business financial condition.

This criterion will be used to provide a financial picture of a firm at a specific point in time in comparison to other
small concerns in the same business area which are not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged
individuals. For purposes of this comparison, concerns in the same business area are those which are primarily engaged
in the same four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. SBA will rely on published data showing business
and financial profiles of similarly sized businesses operating within the same four-digit SIC code as the applicant,
except where such data is not reasonably available. In such a case SBA may rely on published data pertaining to small
business concerns in closely related four-digit SIC code(s) to derive the comparative profiles. In evaluating a
concern's financial condition, SBA's consideration will include, but not be limited to, the following information:
business assets, revenues, pre-tax profit, working capital, and net worth of the concern (including the value of
the investments in the concern held by the individual claiming disadvantaged status).

set-asides, Small Disadvantaged Business Evaluation preferences, and other programs requiring SBA's determination
of disadvantaged status, SBA will consider the same information and factors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section,
but will apply standards to each factor that are less restrictive than those applied when determining economic disadvantage
for purposes of the 8(a) program. This approach reflects the Congressional intent that partial or complete achievement
of a concern's 8(a) program business development goals should not necessarily preclude its participation in other
Federal procurement programs for concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

(b) In determining whether a concern has the requisite potential for success to be admitted into the 8(a) program,
SBA will look at a number of factors including, but not limited to, the technical and managerial experience and competency
of the applicant concern's managers and of the concern as a whole, the financial capacity of the applicant concern
and the concern's record of performance on previous Federal and private sector contracts in the primary industry
in which the concern is seeking 8(a) certification. While the individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based need not
possess both management and technical capabilities pursuant to &sect;124.104, the applicant concern as a whole
must demonstrate both technical know-how in the primary industry in which the concern is seeking 8(a) certification
and management experience sufficient to run its day-to-day operations. SBA will examine each of these factors to
determine whether an otherwise eligible applicant concern has the potential to successfully perform subcontracts
awarded under the 8(a) program and to meet the business development objectives and goals of the program.

A non-profit organization does not meet the general definition of a concern as set forth in part 121 and &sect;124.100
of these regulations and is, therefore, ineligible for 8(a) program participation. In addition, a business entity

(5) If SBA determines, pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, that funds or assets have been withdrawn to the
detriment of the achievement of the targets, objectives and goals of the Participant's business plan, or to the detriment

an appropriate reinvestment of funds or other assets and such other actions as SBA may deem necessary to counteract
the detrimental withdrawals as a condition of maintaining 8(a) program eligibility. The mere fact that a concern's
net worth has increased despite withdrawals that are deemed excessive will not preclude SBA from determining that
such withdrawals were detrimental to the attainment of the concern's business objectives or to its overall business
development.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A concern owned by a CDC must qualify as a small business concern as defined for purposes of Government procurement

time of any request for reconsideration. A denial of program admission based on a finding that the individual(s) claiming
social and economic disadvantage is (are) not socially and/or economically disadvantaged and/or that such individual(s)
does (do) not own and/or does (do) not control the applicant concern, may be appealed to SBA's Office of Hearings and

The AA/MSB&amp;COD shall issue a revised decision in accordance with the remand order within 10 working days of the

(d) While a Program Participant's projected level of 8(a) contract support is required as part of its business plan
under &sect;124.302(b) as a planning and development tool, the level approved by SBA will not act as a bar to contract
awards above that level so long as SBA determines the concern to be competent and responsible to perform any such contracts
and the Participant is in compliance with any applicable competitive business mix requirement imposed by &sect;124.312.

(f)(1) The eligibility of a Program Participant, including its status as a small business, for a sole source or competitive
8(a) requirement may not be challenged by another Program Participant or any other party to SBA or to any other administrative
forum as part of a bid or other contract protest.

(2) The SIC code assigned to a sole source or competitive 8(a) requirement may not be challenged by another Program
Participant or any other party to SBA or to any other administrative forum as part of a bid or other contract protest.
Pursuant to &sect;121.1703(b), only the AA/MSB&amp;COD may appeal a SIC code designation with respect to a sole source
or competitive 8(a) requirement, and such appeal, if initiated in the discretion of the AA/MSB&amp;COD, shall be
made to OHA.

 All requirements that are offered to the 8(a) program as competitive procurements and those sole source requirements
that are offered to the program without nominating a specific Program Participant (i.e., open requirements) should
be offered to SBA's Division of Program Development, 409 Third Street SW., Washington, DC 20416. Sole source requirements
that are offered to the 8(a) program on behalf of a specific Program Participant should be offered to the appropriate
SBA district office. When a requirement is offered to the 8(a) program, the offering letter or notification from the
procuring agency shall contain the following information:

Acceptance of the requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Upon receipt of the procuring agency's offer of a procurement requirement, SBA will determine whether it will accept
the requirement for the 8(a) program. SBA's decision whether to accept the requirement will be transmitted to the
procuring agency in writing within 15 working days of receipt of the written offering letter, unless SBA requests,
and the procuring agency grants, an extension. SBA is not required to accept any particular procurement offered to
the 8(a) program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Where SBA decides to accept an offering of a sole source 8(a) procurement, SBa will accept the offer both on behalf
of the program and in support of the approved business plan of a specific 8(a) Program Participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where SBA decides to accept an offering of a competitive 8(a) procurement, SBA will accept the offer for the 8(a)
program generally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) SBA will not accept a requirement as a competitive 8(a) procurement where a competition has been conducted by a
procuring agency prior to SBA's formal acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) program and the procuring agency
seeks SBA's acceptance in order to select an apparent successful offeror and/or transmit a contract to SBA for execution.
Such a competition conducted without obtaining SBA's formal acceptance of the procurement requirement for the 8(a)
program will not be considered an 8(a) competitive requirement. In such a case, SBA may accept the requirement for
the 8(a) program as a competitive 8(a) requirement, but the procuring agency would be required to use appropriate
competition procedures again, including issuing a new solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Except for requirements assigned a construction SIC code by the procuring agency contracting officer, all competitive
8(a) requirements accepted by SBA may be competed among all eligible 8(a) Program Participants nationally. The only
geographic restrictions pertaining to 8(a) competitive requirements, other than those for construction requirements,
would be those imposed by the solicitations themselves.

Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) For purposes of the 8(a) program, a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) is not an 8(a) contract award. Each order to be
issued under the BOA is an individual contract. As such, there must be a separate offer and acceptance of each BOA order
before it may be issued through the 8(a) program as an 8(a) contract award. The 8(a) Participant must be eligible to
receive each new order at the time of the order. For example, a concern's size status does not relate back to the time
that the BOA was executed. Instead, a concern must be small at the time of the issuance of each new order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Once a concern's term of program participation expires, or the concern otherwise exits the 8(a) program, new orders
cannot be issued through the 8(a) program because the concern is no longer eligible to receive new 8(a) awards.

Adverse Impact.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SBA has made a written determination that acceptance of the procurement for 8(a) award would have an adverse impact
on an individual small business, a group of small businesses located in a specific geographical location, or other
small business programs. The adverse impact concept is designed to protect small business concerns which are performing
or are seeking to perform Government contracts awarded outside the 8(a) program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In determining whether or not the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on an individual small
business, SBA will consider all relevant factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In connection with an individual small business, SBA presumes adverse impact to exist when a small business concern
has performed a specific requirement for at least 24 months, it is performing the requirement at the time it is offered
to the 8(a) program or its performance of the requirement ended within 30 days of the procuring agency's offer of the
requirement to the 8(a) program, and the dollar value of the requirement that the small business was performing is
25 percent or more of its most recent annual gross sales (including those of its affiliates).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, adverse impact does not apply to ``new'' requirements.
A new requirement is a requirement which has not been previously procured by the relevant procuring agency. Where
a requirement is new, no small business could have performed the requirement and, thus, an impact determination need
not be performed. Construction contracts by their very nature (e.g., the one-time building of a specific structure)
are new requirements. The expansion or alteration of an existing requirement shall be considered a new requirement
where the requirement is materially expanded or modified so that the ensuing requirement is not substantially similar
to the prior requirement due to the magnitude of the expansion or alteration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining whether or not the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on a group of small businesses
located in a specific geographical location, SBA shall consider the effects of a procuring agency bundling various
requirements being performed by two or more small business concerns into a larger contract which would be considered
a ``new'' requirement because of the magnitude of its expansion as compared to any of the previous smaller requirements.
In such a case, adverse impact may be found if one of the small business concerns meets the presumption set forth in paragraph
(c)(1)(i) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In determining whether or not the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on other small business
programs, SBA will consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to, whether or not SBA's acceptance of
a proposed 8(a) requirement is likely to result in SBA taking an inordinate portion of total procurements in the subject
industry to the detriment of the small business set-aside program.

40. Section 124.309 would be further amended by revising the phrase ``a sole source 8(a) contract'' in paragraph (d)
to read ``an 8(a) contract.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41. Section 124.311(a)(2) is amended by removing the following sentence from the end:

 Where a construction requirement offered to the 8(a) program exceeds the $3 million competitive threshold, SBA will

 A concern that has completed its term of participation in the 8(a) program, as set forth in &sect;124.110, may be awarded

(1) For a negotiated procurement, so long as a Program Participant is eligible as of the date specified for the receipt

A joint venture agreement is permissible only where an 8(a) concern lacks the necessary capacity to perform the contract

required to receive 51 percent of the profits (e.g., there can be a 50/50 joint venture relationship between two 8(a)
concerns).

Joint ventures for Small Disadvantaged Business Set-Asides and Small Disadvantaged Business Evaluation Preferences.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Joint ventures are permitted for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) set-asides and SDB evaluation preferences,
provided that the requirements set forth in this paragraph are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For purposes of this paragraph, the term joint venture has the same meaning as that set forth in &sect;121.401(1)
of these regulations. Two or more concerns that form an ongoing relationship to conduct business would not be considered
``joint venturers'' within the meaning of this paragraph, and would also not be eligible as an entity owned and controlled
by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A concern that is owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals entering
into a joint venture agreement with one or more other business concerns is considered to be affiliated for size purposes
with such other concern(s). The combined annual receipts or employees of the concerns entering into the joint venture
must meet the applicable size standard corresponding to the SIC code designated for the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The majority of the venture's earnings must accrue directly to the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals
in the SDB concern(s) in the joint venture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The percentage ownership involvement in a joint venture by disadvantaged individuals must be at least 51 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Small business concern A is 100% owned by disadvantaged individuals. Small business concern B is 100% owned by nondisadvantaged
individuals. The percentage involvement by concern A in a joint venture between A and B must be at least 51%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Small business concern C is 51% owned by disadvantaged individuals. Small business concern D is 100% owned by nondisadvantaged
individuals. Any joint venture between C and D would be ineligible because the amount of ownership involvement in
such a joint venture by disadvantaged individuals would be less than 51%. Even a 90% involvement by concern C in a joint
venture with D would mean an overall ownership involvement by disadvantaged individuals of only 45.9% (51% of 90),
and an overall ownership involvement by nondisadvantaged individuals of 54.1% (10 + (49% of 90)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Upon request by the Program Participant, SBA may waive the requirement for audited financial statements. Waivers
under this paragraph may be granted by the appropriate District Director only for the first year the audited financial
statements are required. Beyond such first year, only the AA/MSB&amp;COD may waive this requirement for good cause
shown by the Program Participant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Circumstances where waivers of audited financial statements may be granted include, but are not limited to,
the following: (A) the concern has an unexpected increase in sales towards the end of its fiscal year that creates an
unforeseen requirement for audited statements; (B) the concern unexpectedly experiences severe financial difficulties
which would make the cost of audited financial statements a particular burden; and (C) the concern has been an 8(a)
Program Participant less than 12 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Program Participants with actual gross annual receipts of $1,000,000 to $4,999,999 shall submit to SBA reviewed
annual financial statements prepared by a licensed independent public accountant (as defined in part 107, Appendix
I, &para; II. B) within 90 days after the close of concern's fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Program Participants with actual gross annual receipts of less than $1,000,000 shall submit to SBA an annual statement
prepared in-house or compilation statement prepared by a licensed independent public accountant (as defined in
part 107, Appendix I, &para; II. B), verified as to accuracy by an authorized officer, partner, or sole proprietor
of the 8(a) concern, by signature and date, within 90 days after the close of the concern's fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any audited financial statements submitted to SBA pursuant to &sect;124.501(c) shall be prepared in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and reflect the independent public accountant's opinion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) While financial statements need not be submitted until 90 or 120 days after the close of an 8(a) concern's fiscal
year, depending on the receipts of the concern, every 8(a) concern must submit a final sales report signed by the CEO
or President to SBA within 10 working days of the end of its fiscal year in order for SBA to determine/verify the concern's
size for 8(a) contract awards and compliance with competitive business mix targets. This report must show a breakdown
of 8(a) and non-8(a) sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Audited or reviewed annual and/or quarterly statements may be required when SBA determines it is necessary to
obtain a more thorough verification of a concern's assets, liabilities, income and/or expenses, or to determine
the concern's capacity to perform a specific 8(a) contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The requirements for submitting financial statements also apply to 8(a) joint venture agreements.

Description of Rulechange Sought: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 To allow a Certified Flight Instructor renewal to be granted to a military pilot with a favorable record of instruction,
or to a military flight examiner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
Petitioner's Reason for the Request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 The petitioner states that there is no provision for renewal of the CFI certificate based on instruction given during
military operations. The petitioner further states that the FARs are clear in referring to the practices of ``company''
check airmen, but make no distinction between check airmen for the airline industry and check airmen for the military.
The petitioner feels that the military aviation experience is credible, professional, and respected in the aviation
industry and should be acknowledged with full credit.

Description of Rulechange Sought: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 To establish an alternative or parallel path for aircraft inspection that would extend the existing annual inspection
requirement to 2 years or 200 hours, whichever comes first, for all aircraft in non-commercial service for whom such
a program would be advantageous. Additionally, the petitioner proposes that all such aircraft engaged in the biennial
inspection program would be subject to a periodic, clearly defined, mandatory field service and be returned to service
by an appropriately rated Aviation Maintenance Technician at intervals not to exceed the lesser of 50 flight hours
or 6 calendar months. Operators who typically fly their aircraft more than 200 hours in a 2 year period for whom this
proposed change would not most likely be economically advantageous, could continue to operate under the annual inspection
program currently prescribed to operate under the annual inspection program currently prescribed under &sect;91.409(a).

Petitioner's Reason for the Request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 The petitioner believes that the existing mandatory annual inspection interval does not adequately address the
true maintenance needs of the general aviation fleet and, in its view, misdirects millions of maintenance dollars
annually. The petitioner further believes that tailoring the regulatory maintenance and inspection requirements
to better suit the needs of general aviation, as proposed by its petition, would enhance aviation safety, better preserve
the general aviation fleet through improved ongoing maintenance, and save aircraft owners a percentage of the onerous
cost of annual inspections.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model
A320 series airplanes. This proposal would require repetitive inspections to verify proper installation of the
plain bushings of the upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew doors, and correction
of discrepancies, if necessary. This proposal would also require replacement of the shouldered bushing on the locking
mechanism with a new oversized bushing, which would terminate the repetitive inspection requirements. This proposal
is prompted by a report that, during an emergency evacuation of in-service airplanes, the left aft passenger/crew
door jammed against the fuselage structure in a nearly closed position due to bushing migration. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent jamming of the passenger/crew door, which could delay or impede the evacuation
of passengers during an emergency.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes. The DGAC
advises that, during an emergency evacuation of an in-service airplane, the left aft passenger/crew door jammed
against the fuselage structure in a nearly closed position. Investigation revealed the bushing of the lower connection
link had migrated. The cause of this migration has been attributed to the seizing of the upper locking hook into its
bronze bushing from the frame segment at the level of the door lifting bellcranks. This condition, if not corrected,
could result in jamming of the passenger/crew door, which could delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during
an emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;52&hyph;1047, dated April 25, 1994, which describes procedures for:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Performing repetitive detailed visual inspections to verify proper installation of the plain bushings of the
upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew doors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Removing the passenger/crew door and inspecting the bushings to detect damage, if any bushing has migrated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Reinstalling the bushing, if the bushing housings are not damaged; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Reaming the door structure and installing an oversize shouldered bushing, if any bushing housing is damaged; and
repairing the bushing housing, if damage is not completely removed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Airbus has also issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;52&hyph;1027, Revision 3, dated December 10, 1993, which describes
procedures for replacing the shouldered bushing on the locking mechanism with a new oversized bushing, which will
prevent jamming of the passenger/crew door.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DGAC classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 93&hyph;207&hyph;048(B),
dated December 8, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive detailed visual inspections to
verify proper installation of the plain bushings of the upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew
doors, and correction of discrepancies, if necessary. The proposed AD would also require replacement of the shouldered
bushing on the locking mechanism with a new oversized bushing, which would terminate the repetitive inspection requirements.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.
Correction of certain discrepancies would be required to be accomplished in accordance with a method approved by
the FAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 99 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. It would take approximately
72 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required
parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the modification proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $392,040, or $3,960 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection at an average labor rate
of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspection proposed by this AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $32,670, or $330 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of the inspection and modification proposed by this AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $424,710, or $4,290 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
767 series airplanes. This proposal would require replacement of the currently installed door opening actuators
of the emergency off-wing escape system with new, improved actuators. This proposal is prompted by reports indicating
that the requirements of a previously issued AD do not adequately preclude leakage from these actuators. The actions
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the escape slide to deploy, which could delay and possibly

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardize successful emergency evacuation of an airplane.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 15, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327 (57 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
47987, October 21, 1992), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 and Model 767 series airplanes. That AD requires
repetitive inspections (weighing program) of the door opening/snubbing actuators of the escape system (for Model
747 series airplanes) and the door opening/snubbing actuators of the off-wing escape slide (for Model 767 series
airplanes), and modification of the door latching mechanism of the escape slide compartment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report from an operator of Model 767 series airplanes that several
actuators leaked following accomplishment of the modification procedures required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17.
Therefore, the FAA has determined that the modification requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 do not adequately
preclude leakage from these actuators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this operator also reported that, during subsequent inspections (weighing program) of these actuators,
the weight in several actuators increased from the original weight measured during the initial inspection (weighing
program) required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. Therefore, the FAA finds that the inspection requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17
cannot reliably determine the fluid level of these actuators by the weighing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, since the issuance of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, the manufacturer has developed a new, improved actuator for
Model 767 series airplanes. These new actuators are not fluid-filled. The old actuators were fluid-filled and had
a tendency to leak, which caused the actuator to fail.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Failure of the door opening/snubbing actuator, if not corrected, could result in the escape slide failing to deploy,
which could delay and possibly jeopardize the successful emergency evacuation of an airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;25&hyph;0216, dated February 3, 1994, which
describes procedures for replacement of currently installed door opening actuators of the off-wing emergency escape
system with new, improved actuators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require replacement of the currently installed door opening actuators of the emergency
off-wing escape system on Model 767 series airplanes with new, improved actuators. The actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 to inspect the door opening/snubbing actuators of the off-wing escape
slide, and modify and inspect the door latching mechanism of the escape slide compartment of Model 767 series airplanes
have been retained in this proposal. However, accomplishment of the proposed actuator replacement would constitute
terminating action for those requirements. Accordingly, the FAA will, in a separate rulemaking action, revise AD
92&hyph;16&hyph;17 to remove these requirements for Model 767 series airplanes from that AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 460 Boeing Model 767 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 173 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspections and modification currently required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, and retained in this proposal, take
approximately 12 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts
cost approximately $510 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these inspections and modification
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $146,250, or $1,170 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed replacement would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane at an average labor rate of $55 per work
hour. Required parts would cost approximately $6,400 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the proposed replacement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,126,230, or $6,510 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most
prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy,
an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only
after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting
and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety
that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that
this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore
that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit
analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent failure of the escape slide to deploy, which could delay and possibly jeopardize successful emergency
evacuation of an airplane, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within 18 months after November 25, 1992 (the effective date of AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327), inspect the off-wing escape slide door opening/snubbing actuators
in accordance with OEA Service Bulletin 3092100&hyph;25&hyph;002, dated July 26, 1991. Repeat this inspection
thereafter at intervals not to exceed 20 months until the replacement required by paragraph (c) is accomplished.
For operators that have previously accomplished this inspection in accordance with AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17: This
paragraph requires that the next scheduled inspection be performed within 20 months after the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within 18 months after November 25, 1992 (the effective date of AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327), inspect and modify the escape slide compartment door latching mechanism
in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;25A0174, dated August 15, 1991. Accomplishment of the
actions required by this paragraph prior to the effective date of this AD terminates the actions required by paragraph
(b)(2) of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Within 2 years after the effective date of this AD, replace the currently installed door opening actuator of the
emergency off-wing escape system with a new, improved actuator, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;25&hyph;0216,
dated February 3, 1994. Accomplishment of this replacement terminates the repetitive inspection requirements
of paragraph (a) of this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) As of 2 years after the effective date of this AD, only door opening actuators of the emergency off-wing escape system
having OEA part number 5262100 (Boeing part number 5416T208&hyph;12) shall be installed on any airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane
Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO.

Employer Identification Numbers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA maintains a record of the wages and self-employment income of each individual. The record includes earnings covered
under title II of the Social Security Act (the Act), earnings covered under title XVIII of the Act, and earnings not
covered under the Act. The record is identified by the individual's social security number. Wages posted to an individual's
record are based on wage reports submitted to SSA and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by employers. IRS regulations
at 26 CFR 31.6011(a)&hyph;1 require an employer to file employment tax returns with IRS each year and IRS regulations
at 26 CFR 31.6051&hyph;2 and 31.6091&hyph;1(d) require an employer to file wage reports with SSA each year. These
requirements are also explained on wage reporting forms and in related instructions issued by SSA and IRS. To help
account for these returns and reports, IRS assigns an employer identification number (EIN) to every employer. However,
SSA will assign a special identification number to one or more political subdivisions of a State which submits a modification
to its coverage agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under section 218 of the Act. These
numbers are assigned only for State bookkeeping purposes unless coverage is extended to periods prior to 1987. Then,
the special number will be assigned and used for reporting the pre-1987 wages to SSA. The special number will also be
assigned to an interstate instrumentality if pre-1987 coverage is obtained.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 232 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 432, was added by section 8 of Public Law 94&hyph;202. Section 8 is cited as the ``Combined
Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance-Income Tax Reporting Amendments of 1975.'' Section 232 provides
authority for the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of HHS to make available such documents that are agreed
upon as being necessary for processing information contained in returns required by the Internal Revenue Code and
by IRS regulations. Under this authority and Pub. L. 94&hyph;455 and 95&hyph;216, SSA and IRS have entered into an
Agreement governing the manner in which employer wage reports will be processed. Included in this process are the
wage reports which employers are required to file annually with SSA. As required by IRS regulations at 26 CFR 301.6011&hyph;2,
employers who file 250 or more wage reports per year must file them on magnetic media, unless the requirement is waived
by IRS. These proposed regulations reflect these requirements for filing annual wage reports with SSA and explain
how SSA will process the reports and reconcile reporting errors with IRS, employees, and employers.

We are also proposing to consolidate &sect;&sect;

422.115 and 422.120 to include in one section (proposed &sect;422.120) our current procedures for processing wage
reports, submitted to us by employers, that do not include a worker's social security number or include an incorrect
name or number. The existing regulations provide that we will first contact the employer for the missing information
or correction. However, in the proposed regulation, we state our current procedure which is to attempt to contact
the employee first. Additionally, we provide that we may return to the employer a wage report submittal if 90 percent
or more of the wage reports are unidentified or incorrectly identified. We also explain in the proposed &sect;422.120
that we will inform IRS of all wage reports filed with SSA that do not include the required social security numbers.
IRS may then assess the employer a penalty for erroneous report filing, pursuant to the authority provided in section
6721 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6721.

Under section 6057 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6057, certain private pension plan administrators must
file with the IRS annual reports that identify individuals who separated from plan coverage during the year and still
have a right to future retirement benefits. In addition, this provision of the Internal Revenue Code provides for
transmitting copies of the annual reports to the Secretary of HHS. The copies are forwarded to SSA and transcribed
onto an electronic record for the purpose of maintaining the pension information which SSA must provide to specified
individuals, as explained below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1131 of the Act requires that whenever the Secretary of HHS makes a finding of fact and a decision as to the entitlement
of an individual to social security or medicare benefits under title II of the Act or is requested to do so, the Secretary
must transmit to the individual any information, as reported by the employer, regarding any deferred vested benefits
under a private pension plan. In these proposed rules, we explain how we administer this provision.

We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these rules do not meet the criteria
for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed rules contain reporting requirements in &sect;&sect;422.114 (e) and (f) and 422.120(a). We would
normally seek approval of these requirements, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, from the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB). We are not doing so in this situation because we already have clearance from OMB to collect this information
using forms SSA&hyph;L93, 95 and 97 (OMB No. 0960&hyph;0432) and form SSA&hyph;2765 (OMB No. 0960&hyph;0694).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is also a reporting requirement in &sect;422.122, which deals with information on deferred vested pension
benefits. As required by section 2(a) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h), we will submit a copy
to OMB for its review of this information collection requirement. Other organizations and individuals desiring
to submit comments on these information collection requirements should direct them to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, New Executive Office Building, Room 3208, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer
for HHS.

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 30 minutes per response. This
includes the time it will take to understand what is needed, gather the necessary facts, and provide the information.

. When a State submits a modification to its agreement with the Secretary under section 218 of the Act, SSA will assign
a special identification number to each political subdivision included in that modification. SSA will inform the
State of the special identification number(s) by sending a Form SSA&hyph;214&hyph;CD, ``Notice of Identifying
Number,'' to the State. These numbers are assigned only for State bookkeeping purposes unless coverage is extended
to periods prior to 1987. Then, the special number will be assigned and used for reporting the pre-1987 wages to SSA.
The special number will also be assigned to an interstate instrumentality if pre-1987 coverage is obtained and SSA
will send a Form SSA&hyph;214&hyph;CD to the interstate instrumentality to notify it of the number assigned.

(IRS) regulations at 26 CFR 31.6011(b)&hyph;1 to obtain an employer identification number (EIN) and to include it
on wage reports filed with SSA. A sole proprietor who does not pay wages to one or more employees or who is not required
to file any pension or excise tax return is not subject to this requirement. To apply for an EIN, employers file Form
SS&hyph;4, ``Application for Employer Identification Number,'' with the IRS. For the convenience of employers,
Form SS&hyph;4 is available at all SSA and IRS offices. Household employers, agricultural employers, and domestic
corporations which elect social security coverage for employees of foreign subsidiaries who are citizens or residents
of the U.S. may be assigned an EIN by IRS without filing an SS&hyph;4.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the authority of section 232 of the Act, SSA and IRS have entered into an agreement that sets forth the manner by
which SSA and IRS will ensure that the processing of employee wage reports is effective and efficient. Under this agreement,
employers are instructed by IRS to file annual wage reports with SSA on paper Forms W&hyph;2, ``Wage and Tax Statement,''
and Forms W&hyph;3, ``Transmittal of Income and Tax Statements,'' or equivalent
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
 W&hyph;2 and W&hyph;3 magnetic media reports. Special versions of these forms for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa,
the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are also filed with SSA. SSA processes all
wage reporting forms for updating to SSA's earnings records and IRS tax records, identifies employer reporting errors
and untimely filed forms for IRS penalty assessment action, and takes action to correct any reporting errors identified,
except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. SSA also processes Forms W&hyph;3c, ``Transmittal of Corrected
Income Tax Statement,'' and W&hyph;2c, ``Statement of Corrected Income and Tax Amounts'' (and their magnetic media
equivalents) that employers are required to file with SSA when certain previous reporting errors are discovered.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Magnetic media reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under IRS regulations at 26 CFR 301.6011&hyph;2, employers who file 250 or more W&hyph;2 wage reports per year must
file them on magnetic media in accordance with requirements provided in SSA publications, unless IRS grants the employer
a waiver. Basic SSA requirements are set out in SSA's Technical Instruction Bulletin No. 4, ``Magnetic Media Reporting.''
Special filing requirements for U.S. territorial employers are set out in SSA Technical Instruction Bulletins No.
5 (Puerto Rico), No. 6 (Virgin Islands), and No. 7 (Guam and American Samoa). At the end of each year, SSA mails these
technical instructions to employers (or third parties who file wage reports on their behalf) for their use in filing
wage reports for that year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Processing late and incorrect magnetic media wage transmittals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If an employer's transmittal of magnetic media wage reports is received by SSA after the filing due date, SSA will notify
IRS of the late filing so that IRS can decide whether to assess penalties for late filing, pursuant to section 6721 of
the Internal Revenue Code. If reports do not meet SSA processing requirements (unprocessable reports) or are out
of balance on critical money amounts, SSA will return them to the employer to correct and resubmit. In addition, beginning
with wage reports filed for tax year 1993, if 90 percent or more of an employer's magnetic media wage reports have no
social security numbers or incorrect employee names or social security numbers so that SSA is unable to credit their
earnings to its records, SSA will not attempt to correct the errors, but will instead return the reports to the employer
to correct and resubmit (see also &sect;422.120(b)). An employer must correct and resubmit incorrect and unprocessable
magnetic media wage reports to SSA within 45 days from the date of the letter sent with the returned report. Upon request,
SSA may grant the employer a 15-day extension of the 45-day period. If an employer does not submit corrected reports
to SSA within the 45-day (or, if extended by SSA, 60-day) period, SSA will notify IRS of the late filing so that IRS can
decide whether to assess a penalty. If an employer timely resubmits the reports as corrected magnetic media reports,
but they are unprocessable or out of balance on W&hyph;2 money totals, SSA will return the resubmitted reports for
the second and last time for the employer to correct and return to SSA. SSA will enclose with the resubmitted and returned
forms a letter informing the employer that he or she must correct and return the reports to SSA within 45 days or be subject
to IRS penalties for late filing.

Paper form reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The format and wage reporting instructions for paper forms are determined jointly by IRS and SSA. Basic instructions
on how to complete the forms and file them with SSA are provided in IRS forms materials available to the public. In addition,
SSA provides standards for employers (or third parties who file wage reports for them) to follow in producing completed
reporting forms from computer software; these standards appear in SSA publication, ``Software Specifications
and Edits for Annual Wage Reporting.'' Requests for this publication should be sent to: Social Security Administration,
Office of Financial Policy and Operations, Attention: AWR Software Standards Project, P.O. Box 17195, Baltimore,
MD 21235.

Processing late and incorrect paper form reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If SSA receives paper form wage reports after the due date, SSA will notify IRS of the late filing so that IRS can decide
whether to assess penalties for late filing, pursuant to section 6721 of the Internal Revenue Code. SSA will ask an
employer to provide replacement forms for illegible, incomplete, or clearly erroneous paper reporting forms, or
will ask the employer to provide information necessary to process the reports without having to resubmit corrected
forms. If an employer fails to provide legible, complete, and correct W&hyph;2 reports within 45 days, SSA may identify
the employers to IRS for assessment of employer reporting penalties.

Reconciliation of wage reporting errors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After SSA processes wage reports, it matches them with the information provided by employers to the IRS on Forms 941,
``Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return,'' for that tax year. Based upon this match, if the total social security
or medicare wages reported to SSA for employees is less than the totals reported to IRS, SSA will write to the employer
and request corrected reports or an explanation for the discrepancy. If the total social security or medicare wages
reported to SSA for employees is more than the totals reported to IRS, IRS will resolve the difference with the employer.
If the employer fails to provide SSA with corrected reports or information that shows the wage reports filed with SSA
are correct, SSA will ask IRS to investigate the employer's wage and tax reports to resolve the discrepancy and to assess
any appropriate reporting penalties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Correcting an earnings report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If an employer reports an employee's wages without the employee's social security number or with a different employee
name or social security number than shown in SSA's records for him or her, SSA will write to the employee at the address
shown on the wage report and request the missing or corrected information. If the wage report does not show the employee's
address or shows an incomplete address, SSA will write to the employer and request the missing or corrected employee
information. SSA notifies IRS of all wage reports filed without employee social security numbers so that IRS can decide
whether to assess penalties for erroneous filing, pursuant to section 6721 of the Internal Revenue Code. If an individual
reports self-employment income without a social security number or with a different name or social security number
than shown in SSA's records, SSA will write to the individual and request the missing or corrected information. If
the employer, employee, or self-employed individual does not provide the missing or corrected report information
in response to SSA's request, the wages or self-employment income cannot be identified and credited to the proper
individual's earnings records. In such cases, the information is maintained in a ``Suspense File'' of uncredited
earnings. Subsequently, if identifying information is provided to SSA for an individual whose report is recorded
in the Suspense File, the wages or self-employment income then may be credited to his or her earnings record.

. SSA may return to the filer, unprocessed, an employer's annual wage report submittal if 90 percent or more of the wage
reports in that submittal are unidentified or incorrectly identified. In such instances, SSA will advise the filer
to return corrected wage reports within 45 days to avoid any possible IRS penalty assessment for failing to file correct
reports timely with SSA (see also &sect;422.114(c)). Upon request, SSA may grant the employer a 15-day extension
of the 45-day period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claimants for benefits
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each month, SSA checks the name and social security number of each new claimant for social security benefits or for
hospital insurance coverage to see whether the claimant is listed in SSA's electronic pension benefit record. This
record contains information received from IRS on individuals for whom private pension plan administrators have
reported to IRS, as required by section 6057 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 6057), as possibly having a right
to future retirement benefits under the plan. SSA sends a notice to each new claimant for whom it has pension benefit
information, as required by section 1131 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b&hyph;1). If the claimant filed for the lump-sum
death payment on the social security account of a relative, SSA sends the claimant the pension information on the deceased
individual. In either case, SSA sends the notice after it has made a decision on the claim for benefits. The notice shows
the type, payment frequency, and amount of pension benefit, as well as the name and address of the plan administrator
as reported to the IRS. This information can then be used by the claimant to claim any pension benefits still due from
the pension plan.

 Section 1131 of the Act also requires SSA to provide available pension benefit information on request. SSA will provide
this pension benefit information only to the individual who has the pension coverage (or a legal guardian or parent,
in the case of a minor, on the individual's behalf). However, if the individual is deceased, the information may be
provided to someone who would be eligible for any underpayment of benefits that might be due the individual under &sect;404.503(b)
of part 404 of this chapter. All requests for such information must be in writing and should contain the following information:
the individual's name, social security number, date of birth, and parent's names; any information the requester
may have concerning the name of the pension plan involved and the month and year coverage under the plan ended; the name
and address of the person to whom the information is to be sent; and the requester's signature under the following statement:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is approving the State's SIP revision, as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule,
no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule
will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action
should do so at this time.

 The purpose of this document is to announce the availability of three reports that EPA is considering as it develops
the final Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System (final Guidance) and to request public comment on the possible
application of the data set forth in these reports in the final Guidance. The proposed Water Quality Guidance for the
Great Lakes System (proposed Guidance) was published on April 16, 1993, in the

The three reports being made available for public comment today are: ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the
Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests''; ``1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption
Study''; and ``Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Technical Support Document for the Procedure to Determine Bioaccumulation
Factors, July 1994.'' EPA wants to ensure that the public has an opportunity to comment on whether: the conversion
factors for converting total recoverable metal criteria to dissolved metal criteria should be adopted in the final
Guidance methodology for aquatic life; the fish consumption rates used in the development of human health criteria
and values should be adjusted based on the results of the 1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption
Study; and the changes in the methodology for deriving Bioaccumulation Factors (BAFs) should be incorporated in
the final Guidance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(1)) requires EPA to publish and periodically update National
ambient water quality criteria. These criteria are to reflect the latest scientific knowledge on the identifiable
effects of pollutants on public health and welfare, aquatic life and recreation. Section 118(c)(2) of the Clean Water
Act requires EPA to publish water quality guidance for the Great Lakes System which includes guidance on numerical
limits on pollutants in ambient Great Lakes waters to protect human health, aquatic life and wildlife. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final Guidance will establish minimum water quality standards, antidegradation policies, and implementation
procedures for waters within the Great Lakes System in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, including waters within the jurisdiction of Indian Tribes within the Great
Lakes System.

A. Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the toxicity tests used to develop EPA metals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for aquatic life, some fraction of the metal is dissolved while some fraction is precipitated or bound to
particulate matter. It is generally believed that dissolved metals are more available for uptake by aquatic organisms
than the bound or precipitated metal fractions and thus more likely to exert a toxic effect. The present National criteria
to protect aquatic life were developed using total recoverable metal measurements or measures expected to give equivalent
results in toxicity tests, and are expressed as total recoverable. In the past, States and Tribes have independently
made the decision to express their metals criteria as either dissolved metal concentrations or total recoverable
concentrations when applying the National aquatic life criteria.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The acute and chronic aquatic life criteria presented in the proposed Guidance were expressed using total recoverable
metal measurements, in conformance with the EPA policy at the time. In the preamble to the proposed Guidance, it was
noted that a State or Tribe had flexibility when deriving criteria to choose either the total recoverable or dissolved
contaminant concentrations. EPA suggested that a site-specific criteria modification procedure known as the water-effects
ratio could address concerns about the bioavailability and toxicity of total recoverable or dissolved concentrations.
The preamble also indicated that EPA would promulgate total recoverable metals criteria for those States and Tribes
who failed to adopt the criteria within the specified time period as written in the proposed Guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) recommended in its December 16, 1992, report, ``Evaluation of the Guidance
for the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative,'' that EPA consider both the biologically active form and the total
contaminant concentrations of a pollutant when establishing water quality criteria (USEPA, 1992). To further elicit
comment on the use of total recoverable vs. dissolved metal concentrations in developing future National aquatic
life criteria, EPA held a meeting with invited experts in January 1993 in Annapolis, Maryland. The Agency solicited
comments on the recommendations made by the presenters at the meeting in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 9, 1993 (58 FR 32131). Based on the data presented at the conference, and the individual opinions of the majority
of assembled scientists, EPA determined that the dissolved metal concentration approximates the bioavailable
fraction of waterborne metals for aquatic organisms better than the total recoverable concentration of metals.
However, the scientists believed the total recoverable measurements in ambient water also have value, because exceedances
of criteria on a total recoverable basis indicate that metal loadings could be a stress to the ecosystem, particularly
in locations other than the water column. As a follow-up to the meeting, on October 1, 1993, EPA's Office of Water issued
a memorandum to all EPA Regional Water Management Division Directors providing policy and guidance on the interpretation
and implementation of aquatic life criteria for the management of metals (USEPA, 1993). The memorandum covered a
number of areas including the expression of aquatic life criteria, total maximum daily loads, permits, effluent
monitoring, compliance, and ambient monitoring. With regard to expression of aquatic life criteria, the memorandum
recommended that State water quality standards be based on dissolved metals because dissolved metal concentrations
more closely approximate the bioavailable fraction of metal in the water column than does total recoverable metal
concentrations. However, because the present National aquatic life criteria were developed using total recoverable
measurements, it is necessary to use a conversion factor to convert the total recoverable metal concentrations to
equivalent dissolved metal concentrations. The October 1993 memorandum suggested conversion factors for 10 metals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since that time, additional work has been completed to refine these conversion factors. Possible conversion factors
for seven of the nine metals included in Tables 1 and 2 of the proposed Guidance for aquatic life are included in Table
1 of this Notice along with a conversion factor for lead. In addition, Table 1 includes preliminary conversion factors
for cadmium and mercury(II). The basis for the cadmium and mercury(II) conversion factors can be found in the October
1993 memorandum discussed above. Additional tests for cadmium and mercury(II) are being conducted as described
in the report ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests''.
EPA does not at this time have any reason to believe that the final conversion factors for cadmium and mercury(II) will
be different. EPA does not intend to provide additional opportunity to comment on the final conversion factors for
cadmium and mercury(II).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The methodology and data used to derive the nine conversion factors can be found in the report ``Results of Simulation
Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests,'' which is available in the public docket
as described in the addresses section of this notice. To use these factors, a State or Tribe would multiply the criterion
for a metal in Table 1 or 2 of the proposed Guidance by the conversion factor in Table 1 of this notice. For example, if
the acute water quality criterion for chromium(III) based on total recoverable metal concentration is 15 ug/L and
the conversion factor is 0.333, then the equivalent dissolved metal concentration for chromium(III) would be 5.0
ug/L.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA were to publish the final Guidance with metals criteria expressed as dissolved concentrations, States and
Tribes would be required to adopt metals criteria consistent with the final Guidance. In that situation, a State or
Tribe could adopt criteria expressed as dissolved criteria, or they could choose to adopt the total recoverable criteria
without using conversion factors as in the proposed Guidance, since it is a more stringent approach. If a State or Tribe
did not adopt metals criteria consistent with the final Guidance, EPA would promulgate dissolved metals criteria
for that State or Tribe. This approach is consistent with the recommendations made by the Science Advisory Board and
the scientists who attended the January 1993 meeting in Annapolis, Maryland.

B. 1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The rate of fish consumption is an aspect of exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in the methodology for deriving human health criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current fish consumption rate used in the derivation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National ambient water quality criteria is 6.5 grams/day, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which represents a National average consumption value per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person for freshwater and estuarine fish and shellfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Guidance included a fish consumption rate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 grams/day, which represents the mean exposure level for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regionally caught fish for the regional sportfishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population. This estimate was made from a review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several regional studies in Michigan, Wisconsin and New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A study conducted by West et al., ``1991&hyph;1992 Michigan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study,'' for the State of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Michigan was submitted during the public comment period for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed Guidance. The study had three main 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectives: (1) to determine fish consumption patterns that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could then be used in setting water quality standards in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Michigan; (2) to determine angler compliance with Michigan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish consumption advisories and patterns of preparing fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended in fish consumption advisories; and (3) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine which sub-populations are at greatest risk so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that educational programs about fish consumption advisories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be targeted to those populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The survey was conducted over one year and included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7000 licensed Michigan anglers who were sampled by mail. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systematic random sample was drawn such that stratification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by geographic region and license type within each region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was used to ensure that each licensed angler had the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chance of being selected. By ordering the population by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license type within a region, a proportionate State-wide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of anglers was achieved. Questionnaires were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mailed in two-week cohorts throughout the study period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 30, 1991 through January 29, 1992. Surveyed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals were asked to report detailed fish consumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patterns over the preceding 7 days. The survey reported a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response rate of about 47%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authors of the report include seven options that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represented their opinions on the possible policy choices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the State of Michigan. The seven policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 1_6.5 grams/day. This represents the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption level for the State of Michigan as a whole (not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just sportanglers). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 2_14.5 grams/day. This represents the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sport fish consumption level by Michigan sport fishermen, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted for non-response bias. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 3_24.3 grams/day. This represents the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total fish consumption level by Michigan sport fishermen, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted for non-response bias.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As explained in the preamble for the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance, aquatic organisms accumulate chemicals in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tissues from exposure to chemicals from all sources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including food and water. Further, as organisms at lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trophic levels are consumed by organisms at higher trophic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels, tissue concentrations of some chemicals increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of biomagnification, chemical levels in top 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predators may be orders of magnitude higher than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of the chemical in the ambient water. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the development of National water quality criteria, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used the term ``bioconcentration factors (BCF)'' to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the propensity of an organism to accumulate a chemical in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its tissues. When field-measured bioaccumulation factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(BAFs) were not available, BCFs were used as estimates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs. In the proposed Guidance, EPA requested comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two uses of BAFs, which account for exposure from all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, EPA calculated BAFs for individual chemicals at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different trophic levels. The BAFs at the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trophic level consumed by humans and wildlife species were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then used to derive human health and wildlife criteria. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, if all other factors were equal, a chemical with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher bioaccumulation factor would have a lower (more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent) criterion. Second, EPA used the human health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs to identify a list of ``bioaccumulative chemicals of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern'' which warrant increased attention in the Great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lakes Basin. See Section II.G. (at 58 FR 20843) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble to the proposed Guidance (58 FR 20802). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is today soliciting comment on additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical information about BAFs and alternative options to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaching four issues described in the proposed Guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also soliciting comment on the newly calculated BAFs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the chemicals in Tables 3 and 4 of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance for human health and wildlife species based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and options discussed in this Notice. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs, if promulgated, would change the criteria for human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and wildlife in Tables 3 and 4 of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Guidance included a hierarchy of three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for deriving BAFs for organic chemicals: a field- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured BAF; a BAF predicted by multiplying a BCF measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the laboratory by a food chain multiplier (FCM); and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAF predicted from a BCF calculated from the chemical's n- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
octanol/water partition coefficient (K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
ow
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and multiplied by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a FCM. For inorganic chemicals, EPA proposed to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either a field-measured BAF or BCF. The four issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in this Notice all pertain to the derivation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs for organic chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is considering whether it should revise its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed methodology for the calculation of BAFs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Great Lakes System to incorporate the information discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Technical Support Document, 1994, and summarized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below. The material discussed in sections C.1, C.2, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C.3 would replace portions of the proposed Guidance. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material discussed in section C.4 would provide a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method for deriving a BAF for organic chemicals and this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method would be added to the hierarchy of methods for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organics described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the proposed Guidance, EPA proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require States and Tribes to adopt requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of BAFs that are consistent with EPA's final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology. Although the State or Tribal regulation need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not duplicate this methodology, the State's or Tribe's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method must produce a BAF at least as stringent as the BAFs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived by using EPA's methodology. If EPA incorporates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the topics discussed in the Technical Support Document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, and this Notice into its methodology, States and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tribes will be required to reflect them in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodologies and derivation of BAFs. EPA also notes that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if EPA incorporates the material discussed in sections C.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to C.4 into its methodology for deriving a BAF, EPA would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use this material in promulgating BAFs for any State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tribe.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed Guidance, human health and wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bioaccumulation factors for organic chemicals were based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total concentration of the chemical in water. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highly lipophilic chemicals, however, a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of the total concentration can be associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon (DOC) in water and be unavailable for accumulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs, whether measured or predicted, can be derived using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concentration of the chemical that is freely dissolved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the water in order to account for bioavailability. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested comment on the concept of basing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bioaccumulation factors for lipophilic organic chemicals on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the freely dissolved concentration instead of the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration, but did not provide a specific equation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deriving the freely dissolved concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this Notice, EPA is requesting comment on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equation included in the Technical Support Document, July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, which defines the relationship of a BAF reported on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis of the total concentration of the chemical in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

would also allow consistent usage and derivation of BAFs

through out the Guidance if a model similar to the model

Equation 4 implicitly assumes that n-octanol is an

appropriate surrogate for lipids in aquatic organisms. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
theoretical basis presented by Mackay (1982) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental data suggest that n-octanol is a very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable surrogate for lipids. Equation 4 is also

supported and consistent with the food-chain model of Gobas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1993). For the Gobas model, the BCF

the growth rate of the organisms and the metabolism rate of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, equation 4 is supported and consistent with the

equilibrium partitioning theory being developed by EPA for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the derivation of sediment quality criteria (Di Toro et al.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that predicting the BCF based on equation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4 may provide a more consistent and scientifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second and third methods in the proposed Guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for deriving BAFs for organic chemicals both require use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a FCM based on a biomagnification model by Thomann (1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the proposed Guidance, EPA calculated the FCMs using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thomann's 1989 model of the step-wise increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of an organic chemical from phytoplankton 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(trophic level 1) through the top predatory fish of a food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain (trophic level 4). Food chain multipliers derived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the model ranged from less than one to 100. Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed Guidance, FCMs greater than one would usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to organic chemicals with log K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
ow
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 values in the range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 4.0 to 6.5. EPA asked for comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriateness of FCMs based on the Thomann model, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested possible alternatives to the Thomann model for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predicting BAFs from BCFs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this Notice, EPA requests comment on the use of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model by Gobas (1993) to determine FCMs for non-polar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic chemicals. This model includes both benthic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pelagic food chains thereby incorporating exposures of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organisms to chemicals from both the sediment and the water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
column. The Thomann 1989 model included only the pelagic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food chain and therefore did not account for exposure from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sediment to the aquatic organisms. The model by Gobas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1993) predicts a) the chemical residues in the organisms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and b) the freely dissolved concentration of the chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the water column (C
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
fd
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). With this information, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bioaccumulation factors for each species in the food chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be predicted by the equation:

The resulting FCMs for trophic levels 2, 3, and 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along with the input parameters for the model, are included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Technical Support Document, July 1994. Based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data in the TSD, EPA believes the Gobas model acceptably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predicts BAFs for the Great Lakes System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is considering using the food chain model of Gobas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for deriving FCMs because a) it is easier to define the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
input data needed to run the model, b) predicted BAFs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in better agreement with measured BAFs for chemicals with

very high log K

organisms, consistent with EPA's sediment criteria

approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA is requesting comment on the appropriateness of

4. Biota-Sediment Accumulation Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained above, the proposed Guidance presented a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hierarchy of three methods to derive BAFs for non-polar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic chemicals. In this Notice, EPA requests comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifying the proposed Guidance's hierarchy by adding a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predicted BAF based on a biota-sediment accumulation factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(BSAF) as the second method in the hierarchy. The revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hierarchy would reflect this modification as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. A BAF measured in the field; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A BAF predicted from a field-measured BSAF, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology discussed below; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A BAF predicted by multiplying a BCF measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the laboratory by the food chain multiplier; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A BAF predicted by multiplying a BCF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated from the log K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 by the food chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiplier. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BSAFs may be used for measuring and predicting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bioaccumulation directly from concentrations of chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in surface sediment. They may also be used to estimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs (Cook et al., 1993; 1994). Since BSAFs are based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field data and incorporate effects of metabolism, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biomagnification, growth, etc., BAFs estimated from BSAFs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will incorporate the net effect of all these factors. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSAF approach is particularly beneficial for developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality criteria for chemicals such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain biphenyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
congeners which are detectable in fish tissues and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sediments but are difficult to measure in the water column 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and have reduced bioaccumulation potential due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSAFs are measured by relating lipid-normalized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of chemicals in an organism to organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon-normalized concentrations of the chemicals in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface sediment samples associated with the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure environment of the organism. The BSAF is defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Differences between BSAFs for different organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals are good measures of the relative bioaccumulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentials of the chemicals. When calculated from a common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organism/sediment sample set, chemical-specific differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in BSAFs primarily reflect the net effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biomagnification, metabolism, and bioenergetics and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bioavailability factors on each chemical's disequilibrium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio between biota and sediment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed Guidance, ratios of BSAFs of PCDDs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCDFs to a BSAF for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD) were proposed for evaluation of 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic equivalency associated with complex mixtures of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals (bioaccumulation equivalency factors, see 58 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20802). The same approach is applicable to calculation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs for other organic chemicals. The approach requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data for a steady-state or near steady-state condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between sediment and water for both a reference chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preamble to the proposed Guidance included a list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Bioaccumulation Equivalency Factors (BEFs) for PCDDs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and PCDFs that could be used when converting concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of PCDDs and PCDFs to equivalent concentrations of 2,3,7,8- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCDD. These BEFs have been updated since the proposal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are included in Table 2. The technical rationale for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised BEFs is provided in the Technical Support Document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1994. EPA requests comment on the revised BEFs.

6. Comparison of Proposed BAFs and Potential Final BAFs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Human Health and Wildlife Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Bioaccumulation factors for the 20 human health and 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wildlife criteria in Tables 3 and 4 of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance have been recalculated incorporating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications to the BAF methodology discussed above. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs for these chemicals are compared with the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs in Tables 3 and 4 of this Notice. In addition, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes under consideration in this Notice are incorporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the final Guidance, the BAF for 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would increase from 836 to 1,570. This is significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene could then be classified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Bioaccumulative Chemical of Concern (BCC), chemicals with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs greater than 1000, which could require special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions for control as discussed in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the proposed Guidance, the human health BAFs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated using trophic level 4 and assuming a lipid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content in fish of 5 percent. The wildlife BAFs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated using trophic level 3 or 4 as appropriate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wildlife species and assuming a lipid content in fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 7.9 percent. The derivation of the BAFs for the 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human health criteria, the 4 wildlife criteria, and 1,2,4- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trichlorobenzene are included in the Technical Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document for Bioaccumulation Factors, July 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comments on: (1) The BAFs derived using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the modifications to the BAF methodology; and (2) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to the list of BCCs.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Agency) is today proposing to grant a site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatability variance from the Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment standards for F037 and F038 nonwastewaters that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in, and to be removed from, a 26 acre surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment (Surge Pond). The specific waste was generated when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Surge Pond filled with water and primary sludge from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of process wastewater and stormwater at the Citgo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation petroleum refinery located outside Lake Charles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Louisiana. Approximately 625,000 tons of waste remains in and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be removed from the surface impoundment; this waste was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to a national capacity variance until June 30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If this proposal is finalized, Citgo may complete their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remediation effort that was approved by the Louisiana Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) and EPA Region VI, provided they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the alternative treatment standards specified in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, and also comply with any other applicable land disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions for this waste as specified in 40 CFR Part 268.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 3004(m) of the Hazardous and Solid Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), EPA is required to set ``levels or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods of treatment, if any, which substantially diminish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity of the waste or substantially reduce the likelihood of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
migration of hazardous constituents from the waste so that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-term and long-term threats to human health and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment are minimized.'' EPA has interpreted this language to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mean treatment standards based on the performance of best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated available technology (BDAT). This interpretation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was sustained by the D.C. Circuit in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, 886 F.2d 355 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D.C. Cir. 1989), cert. den. 111 S. Ct. 139 (1990). The Agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, has recognized that there may be wastes that cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated to the levels specified in the rules, due to the fact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the wastes are in a form that is substantially more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to treat than those the Agency evaluated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing the treatment standard (51 FR 40576, November 7, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1986), or where the treatment technology is inappropriate for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste. For such wastes, EPA has established a treatability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance (40 CFR 268.44), to establish alternative treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements for qualifying for a site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatability variance are contained in 40 CFR 268.44(h), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states, ``Where the treatment standard is expressed as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration in a waste or waste extract and a waste generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under conditions specific to only one site cannot be treated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the specified level or where the treatment technology is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to the waste, the generator or treatment facility may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to the Administrator, or her designated representative, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a site-specific variance from the treatment standard. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant for a site-specific variance must demonstrate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the physical or chemical properties of the waste differ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly from the waste analyzed in developing the treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, the waste cannot be treated to specified levels or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the specified methods.'' For a more thorough discussion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions which justify granting a treatability variance and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting information the petitioner is required to submit,

B. Site Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific site addressed by this proposed variance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located at Citgo Corporation's Lake Charles Refinery, 4401 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Louisiana Highway 108 in Calcasieu County in the southwest corner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Louisiana. The surface impoundment in question, referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the ``Surge Pond'' in Citgo's literature, is situated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately adjacent to the west bank of the Calcasieu River, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 10 miles southwest of Lake Charles and 15 miles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
north of the Sabine National Wildlife Refuge. The Surge Pond has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a surface area of twenty six (26) acres. Much of the pond is 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 20 feet deep; the deepest part is about 40 feet deep. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water surface elevation of the pond is six feet above sea level; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the water layer is about 15 feet deep. The bottom of the pond is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filled with sludge which has been accumulating since the 1940's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pond has been receiving untreated petroleum refining process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water and stormwater runoff from the site throughout most of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site's history. The sludge at the bottom of the pond is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary sludge generated by the settling of petroleum refining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater and thus meets the definition of RCRA Hazardous Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Codes F037 and F038. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Surge Pond discharges into the old onsite wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment system. This system consists of an earthen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equalization basin, followed by dissolved air flotation (DAF) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks, an earthen aeration basin, clarifier tanks, a settling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pond, a polishing pond, and then discharges into the Calcasieu 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river at a NPDES regulated outfall (Permit number LA0005941). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(The company's request for a treatability variance only includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludge from the Surge Pond; it does not include any sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by the rest of the old wastewater treatment system.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new onsite wastewater treatment system has been in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation since May 13, 1994. The system now receives stormwater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and process wastewater from the site. The system consists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily of above ground tanks with floating roofs. Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from the tanks are routed to a vapor control system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new wastewater flow path is from API separators, to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equalization tank, to a DAF unit, to aerated activated sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks, to a clarifier. Clarifier effluent discharges to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settling pond of the old wastewater treatment system.

1. Regulations Applying to Citgo's Surge Pond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Surge Pond began operating in the late 1940's, and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been generating sludge since that time. The RCRA regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history of the impoundment, set out in full in Citgo's petition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is complicated. (See Citgo's variance petition for a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thorough discussion of the regulatory history of Citgo's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refinery.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of this history is not relevant for evaluating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition. It is clear, however, that the sludge in the pond is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed as F037 and F038; as such, it became subject to the land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal restriction treatment requirements and prohibitions on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 30, 1994, the date that the national capacity variance for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this waste expired. See &sect;268.36 (c), promulgated at 57 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37271 (Aug. 18, 1992). Thus, the sludge or any residues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated from its treatment cannot be placed on the land, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including back in the Surge Pond, unless first treated to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the treatment standards for F037/F038, since the impoundment does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not qualify as a section 3005 (j) (11) impoundment. Nor does the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company want to put the treated sludge back into the impoundment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The company has also constructed a new tank-based wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment system to replace the old system of surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundments.

2. Listing and LDR Treatment Standards for F037 and F038 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated earlier, sludge from the Surge Pond meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of F037 and F038 nonwastewaters. The listing of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste codes was promulgated on November 2, 1990 (55 FR 46354) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 21955). LDR treatment standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these wastes were finalized on August 18, 1992 (Phase I LDR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final treatment standards for nonwastewaters set total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration limits for 14 hazardous organic constituents based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the performance of combustion or solvent extraction, TCLP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leachate concentration limits for nickel and chromium based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stabilization, and a total cyanide standard based on combustion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a two-year national capacity variance was granted for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F037/F038 wastes generated from the cleanout of surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundments, on the basis of a determination that existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity at bulk solid incineration systems was insufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treat these wastes. This capacity variance expired on June 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994. Before this date, these wastes could be land disposed in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subtitle C facility without meeting the LDR treatment standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also determined that impoundments receiving F037/F038 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes during the national capacity variance would continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have four years from the promulgation of the F037/F038 listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date to retrofit the impoundments to meet the minimum technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements (MTRs), or to close them (59 FR 37220&hyph;37221). After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 30, 1994, the wastes must meet either the LDR treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards or alternative standards established by a treatability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance prior to land disposal, be granted a case-by-case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity extension, or be disposed of in a unit from which there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no migration.

3. Citgo's Management Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo conducted a feasibility study in early 1993 (after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation of the LDRs for F037/F038) to compare and evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their options for closing the Surge Pond. The closure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives considered were a ``no action'' alternative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traditional RCRA clean closure, traditional RCRA in-situ closure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a landfill, closure by removal followed by risk assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(risk based closure), and delay of closure. Citgo chose to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursue closure by removal followed by risk assessment (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo's variance petition for the basis of their decision). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative entailed treatment and disposal of a tremendous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity of F037/F038 nonwastewater that was to be removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pond. The treatment technologies considered in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasibility study included:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time this feasibility study was conducted (early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993), approximately a year and a half remained before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration of the national capacity variance for the F037/F038 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes. Citgo planned that the cleanout would be finished and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that all the sludge removed would be landfilled in a subtitle C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit meeting the minimum technology requirements, as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;268.5(h)(2), before the national capacity variance expired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They constructed a treatment system which is designed to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP waste limit for benzene and controls air emissions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated waste also must meet certain landfill acceptance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria. In particular, this treatment system meets the LDR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level for benzene and also achieves oil recovery, partial removal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of volatile organics, and dewatering and stabilization of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludge which meets LDR standards for nickel and chromium (the two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated metals in F037/F038 wastes); however, the treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system would not meet the LDR treatment standards for most of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
semivolatile organics. Wastewater from the system is redisposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
back into the Surge Pond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo hired a contractor to perform the removal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of the Surge Pond sludge. The conditions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract stated that the clean-up must be completed before June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30, 1994. However, due to technical difficulties with scale-up, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dewatering performance, and the automatic control system for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapor recovery system, the progress of the clean-up was seriously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delayed. In early 1994, it became clear to Citgo that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clean-up would not be finished before the expiration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national capacity variance and that they would need a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatability variance from the LDRs in order to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposing of the residuals from their existing sludge treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

D. Waste Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the most significant distinguishing characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this waste is its tremendous quantity. The feasibility study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in early 1993 estimated that the total volume of sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the Surge Pond was 770,000 cubic yards, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total mass as 745,000 tons with a 30% solids content (230,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tons dry solids). However, Citgo indicated in its petition that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it now appears that these quantities were underestimated by as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much as 25%, which would mean that the original mass of sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was about 993,000 tons. Citgo indicated that approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
625,000 tons of sludge would remain in the pond after June 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, the date that the national capacity variance for this waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expired. This is the quantity of waste that will be affected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposed variance. Approximately 427,000 tons of solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residual will be generated by the treatment of the waste in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surge Pond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sampling and analysis of the sludge was performed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo's feasibility study and again for this variance petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concentrations of hazardous constituents in untreated sludge are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarized in table A.

E. Description of On-site Treatment System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The treatment system Citgo is using consists of air sparging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in tanks to remove benzene (other volatiles do not appear to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed effectively) followed by sludge dewatering. Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from some of the unit processes (shaker system, air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sparging tanks, and chemical mix tanks) are routed to a vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control system which consists of scrubbers for removal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrogen sulfide and a portable thermal oxidizer for destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of volatile organics. The dewatered sludge is then mixed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lime or flyash for purposes of stabilization of metals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing structural integrity to meet the landfill acceptance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria. The stabilized sludge is land disposed at Chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste Management's Subtitle C landfill in Carlyss, Louisiana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The liquid phase goes to tanks functioning as oil-water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separators for recovery of oil; approximately 18% of the oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present in the sludge is recovered. The aqueous discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(wastewater) from the separators is discharged back into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surge Pond; overflow from the Surge Pond discharges into the old 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater treatment system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations that the sludge treatment system must satisfy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the NPDES permit limits for discharge of all site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters, air emission limits, the benzene NESHAP limit (10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ppm), and structural criteria for acceptance at the landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

F. Summary of Citgo's Petition for a Treatability Variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Citgo submitted a site-specific treatability variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition to EPA on April 13, 1994, and submitted additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials as per EPA's request. The petition requests that EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow Citgo to continue land disposing the treated sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by the remediation of the Surge Pond and to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternate LDR standards for their F037/F038 nonwastewaters. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative treatment standards suggested by Citgo are presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in table B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo made the following arguments as justification for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Citgo claimed that incineration is not an appropriate (technology for this waste because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) the tremendous quantity of wastes generated by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remediation exceeds the annual excess capacity available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationwide for F037/F038 wastes (Citgo estimated that the eight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incinerators willing to treat their F037/F038 waste can treat 374 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thousand tons of F037/F038 wastes per year; the Surge Pond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remediation will generate approximately 427 thousand tons of waste after June 30), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the metal content of this waste (4,084 ppm reported average) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is higher than that of typical F037/F038 wastes, such that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incineration of this waste could release large quantities of metals to the atmosphere, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) the hazards of transporting the waste long distances for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offsite incineration exceed the hazards of treating the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onsite and disposing the residuals in the subtitle C landfill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seven miles from the site. Citgo estimated that transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 427 thousand tons of waste to offsite incinerators would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a total of 24 million highway miles and result in 48 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traffic accidents (24 with a possible release of hazardous material to the environment) and 7 traffic fatalities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Citgo claimed that cement kiln combustion is inappropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this waste due to the low BTU content (less than 2,000 BTU/lb) of the waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Citgo claimed that, ``When compared with other treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options, the CITGO approach is clearly the safest for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment and human health.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The company could simply close the impoundment with the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in place, thus doing no treatment at all. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. Basis for Proposed Treatability Variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. EPA Evaluation of Citgo's Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful evaluation, EPA is proposing to grant a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatability variance for the F037 and F038 nonwastewaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by the remediation of the Surge Pond, subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions described in section II.B. Our basis for proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant the petition is described below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) EPA wants the remediation of the Surge Pond to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed. Although Citgo has stated that they prefer to close 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Surge Pond by removal of the sludge followed by a risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment, the closure regulations for interim status surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundments in &sect;265.228 (52 FR 8708, March 19, 1987, amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 57 FR 3493, Jan. 29, 1992) allow the option of closing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment with the waste in place. This would mean that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several hundred thousands tons of untreated hazardous waste could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain indefinitely in an unlined impoundment immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjacent to and in hydraulic communication with the Calcasieu 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
River, several miles upstream from the Sabine National Wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refuge. Hazardous waste constituents have already been detected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the groundwater collected and analyzed from monitoring wells 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the vicinity of the Surge Pond. EPA, the authorized state, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the company have worked out an arrangement whereby the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment can be effectively closed and remediated, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludge securely disposed after treatment. Thus, the alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of closing in place appears to be clearly less desirable than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partial though substantial treatment of the sludge followed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of the treatment residue in a subtitle C MTR landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA supports the ongoing remediation plan, Citgo's choice to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close the pond by removal of hazardous waste, rather than closing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the waste in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As noted, Citgo's remediation plan has been approved by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ). LDEQ has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also approved a temporary variance to a small source exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for air emissions which establishes operating specifications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature and residence time for the portable thermal oxidizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to destroy stripped volatile organics. Although regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of the remediation plan was not required, EPA Region VI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurs with this proposed treatability variance and is currently reviewing Citgo's plan for risk based closure
of the Surge Pond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) EPA agrees that standards which could necessitate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offsite incineration are not appropriate for this waste, within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the meaning of &sect;268.44(a). The quantity of waste being generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this remediation exceeds the available incineration capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for F037/F038 wastes. Although the national capacity variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this waste has just expired, the fact remains that offsite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incineration is not logistically feasible for this large quantity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Citgo treatment system achieves oil recovery and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial treatment of some of the regulated constituents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo estimates that approximately 16 thousand tons of oil will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be recovered during the course of this remediation. Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimization is a high priority for the Agency and activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving recovery of valuable resources are strongly encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Citgo treatment system achieves substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction of most of the regulated constituents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, EPA is proposing to grant the variance request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the treatment technology that is the basis for BDAT ``is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not appropriate to the waste'' under &sect;268.44 (a) and (h). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment technology is not appropriate because of the enormous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume of sludge needed to be treated and because requiring those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards to be met could result in a net environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detriment. (EPA is convinced that CITGO, for reasons that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legally permissible, will choose to close its impoundment with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundreds of thousands of tons of sludge left in place.) Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these exceptional circumstances, EPA believes that a treatability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance can be issued and accordingly is proposing to do so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA is proposing to grant Citgo a treatability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance for the F037/F038 wastes contained in and to be removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the Surge Pond, the company made a statement in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition with which the Agency does not agree. In particular, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency does not agree that the chemical properties of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste make thermal destuction inappropriate for this waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, EPA does not agree that the metal content of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste is sufficiently high to make the waste nonamenable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, it should be noted that wastewater from the sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment system is currently being put back in the Surge Pond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although characterization of this wastewater has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided, this wastewater may contain significant concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of volatile organics which could simply evaporate from the pond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It may be possible to reduce releases of volatile organics from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wastewater to the air by treating this wastewater in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newly constructed closed-tank wastewater treatment system instead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the old system of open surface impoundments. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final Listing Rule for F037/F038 established the Agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position that wastewater removed from wastewater treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludges by dewatering that is recycled to process operation or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned to the treatment system is not a ``derived from'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous wastes if it can be demonstrated that the water removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the sludge is no more contaminated than the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influent to the treatment unit from which the sludge was removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for dewatering (55 FR 46372, November 2, 1990). Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater from the sludge treatment system is excluded from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of hazardous waste and its management is not within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the jurisdiction of RCRA.

B. Proposed Alternative Treatment Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If this treatability variance is finalized, Citgo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation may renew the disposal of the treated sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by the onsite treatment system for sludges removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Surge Pond at the Lake Charles Refinery site in a Subtitle C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste disposal facility (since it remains a hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste), subject to the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The stabilized sludge generated by the treatment system must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the F037/F038 nonwastewater treatment standards for benzene, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chromium, and nickel and the NESHAP standard for benzene prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal in a subtitle C regulated facility. Treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene will also result in incidental treatment of volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organics in the waste. Meeting LDR and NESHAP standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene should also assure optimized operation of the treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, since it is designed to treat benzene. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents that are normally regulated for F037/F038 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonwastewaters are not regulated for this waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The vapor control system must be operated in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance specifications required by LDEQ, which state that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal oxidizer fire box temperature shall be maintained at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1600
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F or higher for one second or more. If the vapor control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system malfunctions, operation of the system must cease until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem has been corrected.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7 announces its intent to delete the Dupont County Road X23 Site,
Lee County, Iowa Site, from the National Priorities List (NPL), which constitutes Appendix B of the National Oil and
Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), and requests comments on this deletion. The EPA identifies
sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and maintains the NPL
as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substance
Response Fund (Fund). Pursuant to &sect;300.425(e)(3) of the National Contingency Plan (NCP), any site deleted
from the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions if future conditions at the site warrant such action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA will accept comments on its intention to delete this site from the NPL for thirty days after the publication
of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses the procedures
that the EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses how the site meets the deletion criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. NPL Deletion Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCP establishes the criteria that EPA uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR 300.425(e), sites
may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, EPA, in consultation
with the State, will consider whether any of the following criteria have been met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Responsible parties or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented and no further response action
by responsible parties is appropriate; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment
and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121(f)(1)(C) of CERCLA, and &sect;300.425(e)(2) of the NCP require State concurrence before deleting a
site from the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude eligibility for subsequent Fund-financed actions if future conditions
warrant such actions. Section 300.425(e)(3) of the NCP states: ``All releases deleted from the NPL are eligible for
further Fund-financed remedial actions should future conditions warrant such action. Whenever there is a significant
release from a site deleted from the NPL, the site shall be restored to the NPL, without application of the HRS [hazard
ranking system].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual's rights or obligations. The
NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist Agency management. As mentioned in Section I of
this notice, &sect;300.425(e)(3) of the NCP makes clear that deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude eligibility
for future Fund-financed response actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Deletion Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Region 7 will accept and evaluate public comments before making the final decision to delete the site from the NPL.
The Agency believes that deletion procedures should focus on notice and comment at the local level. Comments from
the local community are likely to be the most pertinent to deletion decisions. The following procedures were used
for the intended deletion of the site: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. EPA Region 7 has recommended the deletion and prepared the relevant documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The State of Iowa has concurred with the deletion decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Concurrent with this National Notice of Intent to Delete a notice has been published in local and community newspapers
and has been distributed to appropriate federal, state, and local officials and other interested parties. This notice
announces a thirty (30) day public comment period on the deletion package, which starts two weeks from September 13,
1994 and which will conclude on September 29, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Region has made all relevant documents available in the Regional Office and local site information repository.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments received during the notice and comment period will be evaluated before the final decision to delete is
made. The Region will prepare a Responsiveness Summary, if necessary, which will address any comments received during
the public comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A deletion will occur after the Regional Administrator places a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NPL will reflect any deletions in the next final update. Public notices and copies of the Responsiveness Summary
will be made available to local residents by Region 7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following summary provides the Agency's rationale for recommending deletion of the Dupont County Road X23, Lee
County, Iowa Site, from the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DuPont County Road X23 Site is located near West Point, Lee County, Iowa. The site is comprised of two subsites,
the Baier and the McCarl subsites, located within one mile of each other on County Road X23. The Baier and McCarl subsites
are located within NE1/4, SW1/4, Section 28, Township 68 North, Range 5 West and SE1/4, SW1/4, Section 22 Township
68 North, Range 5 West, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DuPont contracted with Charles Knoch to haul and dispose of paint wastes from its Fort Madison plant during the period

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1949&hyph;53. (Following this DuPont contracted to have the waste taken to the Strunk Farm which was cleaned up voluntarily
in 1981 by DuPont.) DuPont estimates that 48,000 to 72,000 55-gallon drums of waste were disposed of at the two subsites.
The Baier subsite, owned at that time by Mr. Knoch's sister, was the primary disposal site. In inclement weather when
the Baier subsite was inaccessible, Mr. Knoch would use the McCarl subsite. The McCarl subsite was purchased by DuPont
in 1986 to prevent a home being built on the site.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The paint waste was placed in trenches and burned. DuPont estimates that as a result of incomplete burning 4,500 to
7,000 tons of ash might remain on the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Baier site was listed as a potentially, uncontrolled, hazardous waste site in the Eckhardt Subcommittee Report
in November 1979. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The site was placed on the NPL with a hazard ranking System (HRS) score of 46.01 on August 30, 1990, 55 FR 169. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Preliminary Assessment (PA) of the Baier Farm was conducted in September 1980 by the U.S. EPA Field Investigative
Team (FIT). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Field Investigation of the Baier Farm was conducted by FIT in April 1983. Soil sample analysis found seven priority
pollutant metals in concentrations exceeding background (concentrations ranged from 90 to 18,000 ppm). Also detected
were six priority pollutant organics in soil samples (with concentrations up to 220,000 ppb). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 28, 1984, EPA sent an information request letter to DuPont regarding the waste site. DuPont's response indicated
another possible waste site at the McCarl property on Chalkridge Road.

In July 1985 FIT oversaw the installation of three ground water monitoring wells at the Baier Site. Analyses of ground
water samples collected from the wells showed elevated levels of aluminum, barium, calcium, magnesium, potassium,
sodium, iron, manganese and lead. A second round of sampling of these wells in 1986 resulted in similar findings, with
chromium exceeding the Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) set forth in 40 CFR part 141. Downstream surface water samples
showed high concentrations of metals including lead and chromium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Preliminary Assessment for the McCarl subsite was conducted in January 1985 by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIT conducted the Site Investigation for the McCarl subsite in July 1986, including the installation and sampling
of three ground water monitoring wells. Analysis of soil samples from the investigation showed concentrations in
excess of background for barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, copper, manganese, selenium and zinc. Analysis of ground
water samples showed concentrations in excess of MCLs for antimony (32 times the MCL), cadmium, chromium, selenium.
Other metals were also detected. DuPont sampled the McCarl ground water wells in July 1988 and found higher levels
of selenium than found by FIT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Special Notice letter for RI/FS negotiations was sent to DuPont on January 31, 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order (UAO) to DuPont on July 5, 1989. The UAO required a removal action
at the Baier/Fedler subsite and an RI/FS for both subsites. The Removal Action was indefinitely deferred in February
7, 1990, in an amendment to the UAO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RI/FS activities were completed in January 1991. As part of the RI/FS a Baseline Risk Assessment was performed, based
on data from the RI, to evaluate the potential risks to human health posed by potential soil and ground water contamination
at the Site. An ecological risk assessment was prepared in conjunction with the Baseline Risk Assessment. Protective
concentrations of contaminants were established, based on residential exposure for both the average and reasonable
worst-case scenarios. Action levels (cleanup criteria) based on these exposure scenarios were then developed for
soils at the Site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Baseline Risk Assessment indicated that ground water contamination posed no threat to human health because of
the lack of a complete exposure pathway due to the lack of yield from the contaminated water bearing unit. Few receptor
wells exist in the Site vicinity. Furthermore, the nearby residential wells, sampled periodically, indicated that
metals and volatile organic compounds were below all regulatory health-based standards. The ``no-action'' alternative
was selected for ground water.

Based on the completed RI/FS, the ROD was issued on May 28, 1991, and EPA successfully negotiated a Consent Decree (lodged
February 25, 1992, entered April 23, 1992, Case Number 3&hyph;92&hyph;CV&hyph;10028 in the United States District
Court, Southern District of Iowa, Davenport Division) for Remedial Design/Remedial Action (RD/RA) activities
with DuPont. DuPont completed the RA at the Site in September 1993. As required by the ROD, the RA included: (1) All surface
waste materials not amenable to the selected technology, such as metal, grinding balls, and paint cans, were to be
removed and disposed at an off-site RCRA-permitted hazardous waste landfill prior to stabilization/ solidification,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Construction of an on-site waste disposal cell,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Stabilization/solidification of contaminated soils and placement in the on-site disposal cell, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Construction of a soil cap over the disposal cell. Restrictions on the future use and development of the Site were
included to ensure the integrity of the cover and the underlying, solidified soil mass and to prevent human contact
with treated soils. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA in consultation with the State of Iowa, has determined that all fund-financed response activities under CERCLA
at the Dupont County Road X23 Site, Lee County, Iowa have been completed, and that no further response is necessary.
Therefore, it is proposed that the Site be deleted from the NPL.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 206, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Door Locks and Door Retention Components
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, by extending and expanding the standard's existing side door requirements to the back doors of passenger cars and
multipurpose passenger vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 4,536 kilograms (kg) (10,000 pounds
(lb)) or less, including hatchbacks, station wagons, sport utility vehicles, and passenger vans. The purpose of
the standard's requirements, which currently apply only to side doors, is to reduce the likelihood of occupants being
ejected from vehicles in real-world crashes. A recent agency study indicates that each year there are nearly 150 fatalities
in which an occupant is ejected through rear hatches, tailgates, and other back doors of these vehicles. This proposal
seeks to reduce the number of fatalities and serious injuries resulting from such ejections by extending and expanding
Standard No. 206's requirements for door locks and door retention components to back doors. Given the differences
between side doors and back doors, the agency is proposing minor modifications in the performance requirements and
test procedures to make them appropriate for back doors.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Existing Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 206, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Door Locks and Door Retention Components
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, specifies performance requirements for side door locks and side door retention components, including latches,
hinges, and other supporting means. The requirements are intended to minimize the likelihood of occupant ejections
from the vehicle in the event of a crash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard's full requirements apply to side doors other than cargo-type doors and sliding doors; more abbreviated
requirements apply to the latter two types of doors. The standard's full requirements can be summarized as follows.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, each door latch and striker assembly must have a fully latched position and a secondary latch position. The
secondary position serves as a backup to the primary latched position in the event the primary latch is not properly
engaged and adds an additional level of protection in case the primary latch position fails. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, latches and hinges must withstand specified load requirements. A door latch and striker assembly of a side
door, when in the fully latched position, must not separate when a longitudinal load of 11,000 Newtons (2,500 pounds),
or a transverse load of 8,900 Newtons (2,000 pounds), is applied to the latch (``Longitudinal'' loads are parallel
to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline and are applied perpendicular to the face of the latch. ``Transverse''
loads are perpendicular to the vehicle centerline and are applied in the direction in which the door opens). Reduced
load requirements are specified for the secondary latched position. Also, a door latch must not disengage from the
fully latched position when specified inertia loads are applied to the door latch system (Inertia is the property
of matter that requires that a load be exerted on a body to accelerate it. An inertial load is calculated by multiplying
the mass of a body by its acceleration). Door hinges must not separate when specified longitudinal and transverse
loads are applied to the hinge system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, side doors must be equipped with a locking mechanism with an operating means in the interior of the vehicle.
For side front door locks, the outside door handle must be inoperative when the locking mechanism is engaged. For side
rear door locks, both the outside and inside door handles must be inoperative when the locking mechanism is engaged.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard No. 206 specifies test procedures for many of its performance requirements. The standard incorporates
test procedures set forth in two Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) recommended practices: SAE J839b, Passenger
Car Side Door Latch Systems, and SAE J934, Vehicle Passenger Door Hinge Systems.

B. April 1990 Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its review of potential back door safety problems, NHTSA conducted an in-depth accident analysis using
1982&hyph;1986 and 1988 (no national data file for 1987) National Accident Sampling System (NASS) data relating
to door openings and ejections in passenger vehicles involved in crashes that required towing from the scene (hereinafter
referred to as towaway crashes). In addition, the 1988 Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) data were used to assess
the magnitude of the safety problem. The results of these analyses were published on April 5, 1990 in a report entitled
``Hatchback, Tailgate, and Back Door Opening in Crashes and Occupant Ejection through the Back Area'' (1990 Report).
A copy of this report is available in NHTSA Docket 90&hyph;08&hyph;GR&hyph;001. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report concluded that back doors of vehicles so equipped open in 5&hyph;6 percent of towaway crashes, compared
to 1&hyph;2 percent of side doors in such crashes. Further, a hatchback or tailgate was about 3 times as likely to open
as one of the front side doors and about 7&hyph;8 times as likely to open as one of the rear side doors. Of passenger vehicles
so equipped, an estimated 36,244 hatchbacks and tailgates opened in towaway crashes in 1988. More specifically,
an estimated 4,986 passenger van back doors opened in towaway crashes, representing about 4 times the rate of front
side door openings and about double the rate of right rear side door openings (very few passenger vans have left side
rear doors). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the data showed that 53 percent of the back door openings occurred in accidents involving vehicle rollovers,
as opposed to 23 percent of left front door openings and 40 percent of right front door openings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the frequency of back door openings, however, occupant ejection through the back door occurred in only 1 percent
of the towaway crashes involving back door openings. This compares with 8 to 13 percent of occupant ejections through
front door openings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FARS data indicated that there were 8,343 passenger car and MPV occupant ejection fatalities in 1988, 2,190 of which
were from vehicles with back doors. NHTSA's report set forth two methodologies, both using NASS data, to estimate
the number of these fatalities that represented occupant ejections through back doors. One methodology resulted
in an estimate that 93 of the fatally injured persons were ejected through back doors. The other methodology estimated
the number to be 130. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also on April 5, 1990, NHTSA wrote to nine manufacturers (Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Toyota,
Volkswagen, and Volvo) asking their thoughts on how to address the problem of back door openings and requesting information
on design specifications used for the production of back door latch/lock systems. Eight of the nine responded, indicating
that none of their back door latch assemblies, except certain Mazda vehicles, met the requirements of Standard No.
206. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They stated that they did not consider back door openings to be a significant safety problem, however, and indicated
that they had certain design guidelines and requirements that are followed in designing their back door latch assemblies.
Finally, they stated that proper use of seat belts is the most effective method of ejection reduction.

C. June 1990 Petition for Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 19, 1990, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety petitioned the agency to, among other things, extend
the requirements of Standard 206 to back doors. NHTSA denied this petition in a document published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 48261) on November 20, 1990, citing the 1990 Report in its denial. NHTSA concluded that increased use of seat
belts would be a more effective means of reducing back door ejections than extending the requirements of Standard
206 to back doors, and that there was not a safety need significant enough to justify the recommended rulemaking.

NHTSA continued to evaluate the issue of preventing back door ejections and on January 21, 1994, issued an update to
the 1990 Report. The updated report is entitled ``Door Opening and Occupant Ejection through Rear Hatches, Tailgates,
and Other Back Doors'' (1994 Report). The agency published a notice in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 3925) on January 27, 1994, requesting public review and comment on this report. This report is available in Docket

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NASS and FARS data from 1988&hyph;1992 were utilized for this report. Based on an analysis of those data, the report
estimated that each year there are 147 fatalities in which occupants are ejected through rear hatches, tailgates
and other back doors. The data also showed that approximately 95 percent of the victims were not secured by seat belts
and that approximately 10 percent of those victims were children under 10 years of age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In towaway crashes, rollovers accounted for 35 percent of left front door openings, 40 percent of right front door
openings, and 42 percent of back door openings. Also, the data showed that the most common damage associated with door
openings was damage to the latch and striker assemblies. This was true for 60 percent of opened left front doors, 50
percent of opened right front doors, and 71 percent of opened back doors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments were received in response to NHTSA's January 1994 notice. The American Automobile Manufacturers
Association (AAMA) stated that the report showed a low rate of passenger ejection through back doors, and contended
that the data again demonstrate that the most effective means of preventing back door ejections is through the proper
use of safety belts. AAMA encouraged NHTSA's efforts in promoting the use of safety belts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) agreed that a high percentage of vehicle ejections occur because
of lack of use or improper use of safety belts. Nevertheless, Advocates believes that back doors are opening at an unacceptable
rate. To address this problem, Advocates suggested that NHTSA should take multiple actions. That organization stated
that NHTSA should look at the fundamental character of latch/striker designs in addition to increasing latch/striker
strength. Further, Advocates stated that NHTSA should address the current roof strength and side impact standards
as they relate to latch/striker integrity. Finally, Advocates stated that because rear seat belts in some vehicles
are insufficient to assure ready availability to occupants, NHTSA should address that issue as well as evaluate how
rear seats themselves are attached in MPVs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment was also submitted by Mr. Nicholas Perrone of Perrone Forensic Consulting, Inc., and Mssrs. Clarence Ditlow
and Ray Gold of the Center for Auto Safety. They stated that the sum of injuries and fatalities from back door ejections
would approach 1,000 per year. They attached two case studies of back door ejections. These commenters suggested
that the Standard No. 206 test be changed, that the standard be extended to back doors, that laminated glass should
be used for all fixed windows, that side and roof strength for vehicles with high centers of gravity should be improved,
and that back door structures have dynamic integrity.

II. Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overall Proposal and Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the number of fatalities that are occurring as a result of back door ejections, NHTSA has decided to propose
extending and expanding Standard No. 206's side door requirements to the back doors of passenger cars and multipurpose
passenger vehicles (MPVs) with a GVWR of 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) or less, including hatchbacks, station wagons, sport
utility vehicles, and passenger vans. Given the differences between side doors and back doors in the orientation
of their hinges and latches in relation to the vehicle, the agency is proposing modifications to the test requirements/procedures
to make them appropriate for back doors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has previously concluded that Standard No. 206's requirements have been effective in reducing side door ejections.
In November 1989, the agency published ``An Evaluation of Door Locks and Roof Crush Resistance of Passenger Cars_Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 206 and 216 (DOT HS 806 489).'' The study concluded that door latch improvements in
passenger cars implemented during 1963&hyph;68 save an estimated 400 lives per year, reducing the risk of ejection
in rollover crashes by 15 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that extending the existing requirements of Standard No. 206 to back doors would make an additional
contribution toward reducing injuries and perhaps fatalities caused by back door ejections. The agency recognizes
that the increased use of seat belts is also an effective means of addressing this problem. However, despite continuing
efforts by NHTSA, state and local governments, safety organizations, manufacturers and others to promote safety
belt use, fatalities resulting from the ejection of unbelted occupants remain a serious safety problem. Therefore,
while the agency recognizes the importance of continuing efforts to increase safety belt use, it now believes that
an extension and expansion of Standard No. 206's requirements to back doors is appropriate as well. The agency also
believes that, given the increasing popularity of vehicles with back doors, especially vans, this safety problem
may become more serious unless action is taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also notes that the agency is in the process of conducting additional research examining the potential for improving
vehicle latch performance. While that research may lead to a future upgrade of Standard No. 206, the agency does not
believe it should delay the application of the standard's existing and/or modified requirements to back doors in
the interim. The agency believes that the back door ejection problem warrants immediate attention. Compliance should
not present any significant problems since the manufacturers are familiar with the design changes needed, as they
apply to back door latches to meet Standard No. 206's current requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the differences between side doors and back doors, NHTSA believes that some minor modifications in Standard
No. 206's test requirements and procedures are needed for back doors. Of particular note are the differences in the
orientation of hinges and latches in relation to the vehicle and in the variety of designs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The difference in orientation is significant because the requirements and procedures specified for longitudinal
loading of latches and hinges differ from those specified for transverse loading of those components. If all back
doors were just like side doors except for their location on the back of the vehicle, the longitudinal and transverse
directions of the loading would simply be reversed with respect to the latches and hinges of back doors. However, all
back doors are not just like side doors, thus the establishment of appropriate test requirements and procedures for
these doors is somewhat more complicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is considerably greater variety in the design of rear doors than side doors. Side doors almost always open to
the side and most have hinges on their front edges and latches on their rear edges. Rear doors may open upward, downward
or sideways, and have latches and hinges on the top, bottom or side. Moreover, while side doors are generally vertical,
when viewed in a front or back view, rear doors may be vertical or sloped (as in the case of many hatchbacks), when viewed
in a side view.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency notes that there are a number of different designs for rear doors and for their installation. Four typical
back doors used in production vehicles are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Door opens upward, with latch (or striker) at the bottom center of the door with a single striker (or latch) on the
back floor panel or door sill;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Door opens sideways, with striker located at the center of the back side frame and latch located at the side edge
of the door (for example, back doors of large station wagons); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Split doors with top, usually glass, opening upward and bottom tailgate opening downward, with striker at the
bottom of the top glass door and latches or rod/pin connectors at top and sides of the tailgate (for example, back doors
of sport utility vehicles); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Double cargo-type doors, a two-part door that latches to itself with one latch located at the center between the
doors (for example, back doors of some passenger vans). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible that other door designs, such as sliding back doors, may be used in future production vehicles. Therefore,
the agency must also include the sliding back door in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the wide variety of back door designs and latch and hinge orientations, NHTSA believes it is desirable to specify
back door load test requirements in terms of the latch and hinge rather than in terms of longitudinal and transverse
vehicle orientation. In addition, given the nature of the loading that back door latches and hinges are likely to experience
in the event of a side impact to the rear quarter panel of a vehicle, NHTSA believes it is appropriate to require latches
and hinges on doors that open upward to meet load requirements in three rather than two directions.

Requirements for Secondary Latch Position
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard No. 206 requires, for hinged side doors other than cargo-type doors, that each door latch and striker assembly
must be provided with a fully latched position and a secondary latched position. Load tests are specified for each
position. As previously indicated, the secondary position serves as a backup to the primary latched position in the
event the primary is not properly engaged and adds an additional level of protection in case the primary latch position
fails. The requirement for a secondary latch position does not apply to hinged cargo-type doors or sliding doors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of proposing to extend Standard No. 206 to back doors, NHTSA is considering applying the requirement for a secondary
latch position to some or all back doors. The agency requests comments on which types of back doors should be included/excluded
from this requirement and why.

2. Load Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard No. 206 specifies three load requirements for hinged side doors: longitudinal load, transverse load, and
inertia load. The standard specifies differing load requirements for the fully latched and secondary latched positions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Load Test One. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SAE J839 indicates that the purpose of the longitudinal load test for side doors is to determine the ability of the vehicle
latch and striker to withstand a test load perpendicular to the face of the latch. The test procedure states that the
specified load (11,000 Newtons (2,500 pounds) when in the fully latched position and 4,450 Newtons (1,000 pounds)
when in the secondary latched position) is applied perpendicular to the face of the latch. NHTSA is proposing to apply
the same basic test requirement and procedure to back doors. For back doors, however, the agency is proposing to use
the term ``Load Test One'' for this requirement, instead of ``longitudinal load,'' since the latter term would be
inappropriate given the orientation of most back door latches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Load Test Two. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SAE J839 indicates that the purpose of the transverse load test for side doors is to determine the ability of the vehicle
latch and striker to withstand the test load in the direction of door opening. The test procedure states that the specified
load (8,900 Newtons (2,000 pounds) when in the fully latched position and 4,450 Newtons (1,000 pounds) when in the
secondary latched position) is applied in the direction of the door opening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to apply a corresponding test requirement/procedure to back doors. To ensure that this second
load test requirement is not redundant and that latches can meet load requirements in various directions (as may occur
in real world crashes), the agency is specifying that the load for this test is applied in the direction of the fork-bolt
opening and parallel to the plane of the latch face. A depiction of the fork-bolt and the loading direction is given
in Figure 1. For most latches, this will be in the same direction as the door opening. The agency is proposing to specify
the term ``Load Test Two'' for this test requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Load Test Three. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, given the nature of the loading that back door latches and hinges are likely to experience in the
event of a side impact to the rear quarter panel of a vehicle, NHTSA believes it is appropriate to require latches on
doors that open upward to meet load requirements in three rather than two directions, i.e., directions that correspond
to the longitudinal and transverse directions for side doors, and a third direction that is orthogonal to the other
two directions. The agency is therefore proposing a third load test requirement in which a load would be applied in
a direction orthogonal to the directions specified in Load Tests One and Two (i.e., perpendicular to both of those
directions). The test set-up for Load Tests Two and Three is identical. However, the latch in Load Test Three is mounted
in a position perpendicular to that in Load Tests One and Two. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that, as indicated above, Standard No. 206 specifies, for the fully latched position, an 11,000 Newton
(2,500 pound) load for the longitudinal load test and an 8,900 Newton (2,000 pound) load for the transverse load test.
In proposing to extend the requirements to back doors, the agency is proposing the same loads as for the corresponding
Load Tests One and Two. The agency is considering whether an 11,000 Newton (2,500 pound) load or an 8,900 Newton (2,000
pound) load should apply to Load Test Three and requests comments on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inertia Load. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 206 requires that a side door latch not disengage from the fully latched position when a longitudinal
or transverse inertia load of 30g is applied to the door latch system. While the standard's procedures for the other
load requirements specify actual loading of a door latch in a test, mathematical analysis is specified for the inertia
load requirement. The agency notes that while Standard No. 206 only specifies that the inertia load requirement must
be met for longitudinal and transverse loads, SAE 839b recommends that the 30g requirement be met ``in any direction.''
The agency believes that this requirement should be met by back doors in any direction, since many latch orientations
are possible for back doors. NHTSA believes that this would best ensure adequate latch performance in the many loading
conditions experienced during real world crashes. The agency specifically requests comments on the appropriateness
of requiring latches to meet the inertia load requirement in any direction, as opposed to a limited number of directions,
such as those specified for Load Tests One, Two and Three. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Door Hinges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 206 specifies that door hinges must support the door and may not separate when a longitudinal load of 11,000
Newtons (2,500 pounds), or a transverse load of 8,900 Newtons (2,000 pounds), is applied. The same considerations
concerning longitudinal and transverse loads discussed above with respect to latches apply to rear door hinges.
Therefore, the agency is proposing to specify the following three load tests: Load Test One_load is applied in the
direction perpendicular to the hinge face plate; Load Test Two_load is applied in the direction perpendicular to
the axis of the hinge pin and parallel to the hinge face plate; Load Test Three_load is applied in the direction of the
axis of the hinge pin. The third test is proposed for hinges on doors that open upward. The agency is considering whether
an 11,000 Newton (2,500 pound) load or an 8,900 Newton (2,000 pound) load should be specified for these three tests
and requests comments on this issue.

D. Door Locks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 206 specifies that side doors must be equipped with a locking mechanism with an operating means in the
interior of the vehicle. For locks in side front doors, the outside door handle must be inoperative when the locking
mechanism is engaged. For side rear door locks, both the outside and inside door handles must be inoperative when the
locking mechanism is engaged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that many production vehicles do not have a true ``locking mechanism'' on their back doors and
provide no inside door handles. In many cases, unlatching can not be performed by occupants seated near such doors.
As part of proposing to extend Standard No. 206 to back doors, NHTSA is considering applying door lock requirements
to some or all back doors. The agency requests comments on whether the requirements for side front door locks or side
rear door locks should be extended to back doors, which types of back doors should be included/excluded from this requirement,
and why. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Leadtime 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing an effective date of the first September 1 that occurs following a two year period beginning
with publication of a final rule. NHTSA believes that a leadtime of about two years is needed, since manufacturers
will need to make design and tooling changes for many of their passenger cars and MPVs. The agency believes that a longer
leadtime would be unnecessary, since manufacturers are already familiar with the kinds of designs needed to comply
with the requirements of Standard No. 206. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Additional Considerations and Questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the wide variety of passenger car and MPV designs, both with respect to the back door latch itself and with respect
to passenger access to the back door, NHTSA recognizes that there may be a number of issues concerning whether some
of the proposed requirements should apply to only certain back doors and whether any additional modifications need
to be made in the test requirements and procedures to make them appropriate for all covered vehicles. The agency specifically
requests comments on the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. As discussed above, the full requirements of Standard No. 206 apply only to hinged side doors other than cargo-type
doors; abbreviated requirements apply to hinged cargo-type doors and to sliding doors. To what extent should full
versus abbreviated requirements apply to back doors? Are there any back doors, such as split back doors, to which the
requirements should not apply at all? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Are the proposed test requirements adequately clear and appropriate for all back doors? For example, are latch
faces and hinge faces designed so that the direction perpendicular to these components can readily be determined?
Commenters who believe that some of proposed requirements are not adequately clear are encouraged to suggest specific
changes to clarify the procedures. Depending on the comments, the agency may make changes in the procedures in a final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Identify which and how many of your current passenger car hatchbacks, station wagons, sport utility vehicles,
and vans would need to be upgraded to meet the proposed requirements for: (a) latching mechanisms; (b) hinges, and
(c) locks? Please indicate the consumer cost to upgrade and the relative increase in strength or other benefit for
each upgrade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Identify which and how many of your current passenger car hatchbacks, station wagons, sport utility vehicles,
and vans would pass the proposed requirements for: (a) latching mechanisms, (b) hinges, and (c) locks? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Please identify and/or provide any studies or data that might assist the agency in quantifying the safety or other
benefits of this proposed rulemaking action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

III. Costs and Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments to Standard No. 206 would affect back door locks and door retention components on passenger
car hatchbacks, station wagons, utility vehicles, and vans. About 1.5 million hatchbacks, 0.4 million station wagons,
1.6 million utility vehicles, and 1.8 million vans are expected to be produced in the 1997 model year, for a total of
about 5.3 million vehicles that would potentially be affected by the proposed amendments in this notice, if they are
required on a proposed effective date before September 1, 1997.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In an evaluation of back door latches in minivans (docket No. 94&hyph;70&hyph;N01), the agency conducted repeat
tests of 8 latches from different minivans in accordance with the testing procedures of Standard No. 206. Those 8 latches
represented vehicle sales of about 1 million vehicles in 1993. One of the tested latches failed the proposed Load Test
Two requirement and another failed the proposed Load Test One requirement. All the others exceeded those load requirements,
some passing by a margin of 125 percent in the Load Test Two direction and 90 percent in the Load Test One direction. The
6 complying latches represent about 50 percent (0.5 million) of the 1993 minivan sales. It is reasonable to conclude,
therefore, that approximately half of the minivan fleet already meets or exceeds the requirements proposed in this
notice. NHTSA has not tested the back door latch mechanisms of hatchbacks, station wagons and utility vehicles. Given
the data obtained from the minivan tests, however, and considering that most of the 1.6 million sport utility vehicles
have back door latch systems that are similar to those on minivans, the agency believes that about 50 percent (0.8 million)
of sport utility vehicles would also meet the requirements proposed in this notice. Although many additional vehicles
may also comply, the agency has conservatively assumed that all of the vehicles other than half the minivan and half
the sport utility vehicle fleets may require some modification to meet the proposed requirements. That leaves the
total number of affected vehicles at approximately 4.0 million. Although those vehicles could require some upgrading
of their current back door locks and door retention components, these proposed amendments are expected to require
not more than 1 or 2 minor to moderate changes in either latching, hinge, or locking mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating the costs of the 8 minivan latches tested, the agency compared the production costs of a failing latch
and a passing latch, which were $3.87 and $2.81 respectively. Thus, the cost of the superior latch was about $1.00 less
than that of the failing latch. The agency also examined the retail costs of the 8 latches tested, which ranged from
$22.03 to $81.74. The costs of the 2 failing latches were $23.52 and $63.19. The tests demonstrated, therefore, that
a latch that meets the requirements of Standard No. 206 need not be more expensive than one that does not. Other factors,
such as design features and materials used, could significantly affect the costs of latches. Given the assumption
that no more than 4.0 million vehicles may require upgrades because of the proposed requirements of this notice, and
that the cost of an upgrade is not necessarily higher than the cost of current designs, NHTSA has concluded that the
cost of extending the current requirements of Standard No. 206 to back doors would be minimal.

Proposed compliance tests for back door locks and door retention components typically would be conducted with similar
but at times slightly modified test equipment of the type that is currently used to evaluate side door locks and retention
components. Thus, no significant test equipment costs should be incurred by manufacturers. Compliance testing
costs should also be similar to that for side doors, about $110. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, about 147 deaths and 740 injuries occur each year that involve occupant ejection through back doors. The
amendments proposed in this notice should provide some benefits in reducing these deaths and injuries since over
80 percent of these ejection accidents involve hinge or latch damage and these components would be upgraded. However,
at this time, the agency is not able to quantify these benefits or costs with sufficient precision to determine the
cost effectiveness of this proposed rulemaking action. In this notice, the agency is seeking data and comments that
should allow more precise estimates to be made.

IV. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. E.O. 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice has not been reviewed under EO 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The agency has considered the
impact of this rulemaking action and has concluded that it is not ``significant'' under the DOT's Regulatory Policies
and Procedures. Since the amendments in this notice are primarily an extension of the present passenger vehicle side
door latch, hinge, and lock requirements to include the back doors of passenger motor vehicles with a GVWR of 4,536
kg (10,000 lb) or less, the agency believes that any necessary minor to moderate hardware changes can be readily incorporated
into back door designs within the leadtime provided, with very little or no economic impact. Given the lack of significant
industry impact and minor economic significance of this rulemaking, a Preliminary Regulator Evaluation is not considered
necessary and has not been prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that the proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Accordingly, the agency has not prepared a preliminary regulatory flexibility analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that few, if any, motor vehicle manufacturers qualify as small businesses. Therefore, small
businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units would be affected by this rulemaking only to the extent
that they may pay very slightly more for the vehicles that they purchase with the qualifying back door latches and hinges.

NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act and has determined
that implementation of this action would have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

D. E.O. 12612, Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612 and has determined
that the proposals in this notice do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. No state laws would be affected.

E. Civil Justice Reform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed amendments would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103(b), whenever a Federal motor
vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state or political subdivision of a state may prescribe or continue in effect
a standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of a motor vehicle only if the standard is identical to the Federal
standard. However, the United States Government, a state or political subdivision of a state may prescribe a standard
for a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment obtained for its own use that imposes a higher performance requirement
than that required by the Federal standard. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules
establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. A petition for reconsideration or other
administrative proceedings is not required before parties may file suit in court.

V. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the amendments proposed in this rulemaking action. It is requested
but not required that any comments be submitted in 10 copies each. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments must not exceed 15 pages in length (49 CFR 553.21). This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to
detail their primary arguments in concise fashion. Necessary attachments, however, may be appended to those comments
without regard to the 15-page limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, 3 copies of the complete submission
including the purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA at
the street address shown above, and 7 copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted
should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting
forth the information specified in 49 CFR 512, the agency's confidential business information regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments received on or before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal
will be considered, and will be available to the public for examination in the docket at the above address both before
and after the closing date. To the extent possible, comments received after the closing date will be considered. Comments
received too late for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking
action. Comments on the proposal will be available for public inspection in the docket. NHTSA will continue to file
relevant information in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue
to monitor the docket for new material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed
stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments the docket supervisor will return
the postcard by mail.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Parish's alkali grass is an ephemeral, annual species that occurs in small, widely disjunct populations in California,
Arizona, and New Mexico. Its habitat is desert seeps and springs. The grass is threatened by alteration of hydrologic
flows due to spring or seep development, water diversion or impoundment, and groundwater pumping; loss of habitat
from farming, grazing, and residential construction activities; limited distribution; and low population numbers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 28, 1994, the Service published a proposed rule to list the Parish's alkali grass as endangered under the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended. Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act requires that a public hearing be held if requested within
45 days of the proposal's publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A public hearing request was received within the allotted time period from Mr. Ron Wood, Kingman, Arizona.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has scheduled this hearing at 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. (Mountain Daylight Time), September 15, 1994, at the
Greyhills High School, Tuba City, Arizona. Anyone wishing to make an oral statement for the record is encouraged to
provide a written copy of their statement to be presented to the Service at the start of the hearing. In the event there
is a large attendance, the time allotted for oral statements may have to be limited. Oral and written statements receive
equal consideration. There are no limits to the length of written comments presented at this hearing or mailed to the
Service. Legal notice announcing the dates, time, and location of the hearing are being published in newspapers concurrently
with this

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the proposal originally closed on May 12, 1994. In order to accommodate the hearing, the Service
also reopens the public comment period. Written comments may now be submitted until September 26, 1994, to the Service

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 18, 1988, Congress enacted the Shore Protection Act (33 U.S.C. 2601, Public Law 100&hyph;688, 102 Stat.
4139 hereinafter referred to as ``SPA'') to minimize trash, medical debris and other unsightly and potentially harmful
materials from being deposited into the coastal waters of the United States as a result of inadequate waste handling
procedures by vessels transporting wastes on U.S. coastal waters and associated loading and off-loading facilities.
SPA is Title IV, Subtitle A of P.L. 100&hyph;688. The Congressional Conference Report on P.L. 100&hyph;688 stated
that landfills and their attendant barging operations are a major source of floatable waste in harbor areas. The report
concluded that this type of waste has fouled the beaches of this country on several occasions, reducing the quality
of coastal waters, endangering the health of humans, marine mammals, waterfowl and fish, and causing severe declines
in coastal economies dependent upon tourism and recreational uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4102 of SPA, titled Vessel Permits and Numbers, establishes that a vessel may not transport municipal or commercial
waste in coastal waters without: (1) A permit from the Secretary of Transportation; and (2) displaying a number or
other marking as prescribed by the Secretary under Chapter 123 of Section 12502(b) of Title 46, United States Code.
The Department of Transportation (DOT) has promulgated an interim regulation on vessel permitting and vessel numbering
system (33 CFR part 151, subpart B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4103(a) of SPA requires owners and operators of waste sources, vessels transporting waste and waste receiving
facilities to take all reasonable steps to minimize the amount of municipal or commercial waste deposited into coastal
waters both during vessel loading and unloading operations, and during vessel transportation from a waste source
to a receiving facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and DOT have been given authority to implement certain provisions of SPA. DOT is responsible for issuing permits
to the appropriate vessels and for prescribing the number or marking which the vessel must display under section 4102
of SPA. EPA is responsible for developing the regulations, in consultation with DOT, which prescribe waste handling
practices pursuant to section 4103(b) of SPA. This proposed rule, when promulgated, will fulfill EPA's obligation
under SPA section 4103(b). DOT is responsible for enforcing SPA, although the Secretary of Transportation may authorize
other officers or employees of the United States Government to enforce provisions of SPA under title 14 U.S.C. 89.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary of Transportation has designated the United States Coast Guard (USCG) as the lead entity in implementing
SPA on DOT's behalf. Vessel permits under SPA are issued by the USCG in accordance with 33 CFR part 151, subpart B. Under
Sections 4102(d), (e) and 4104(a) of SPA, EPA has a consultation role on USCG permits and can request that the USCG deny,
suspend or revoke a permit. Specifically, SPA section 4102(d) provides that DOT (USCG) and EPA can deny a permit if
the owner or operator of a vessel has a record indicating a pattern of serious violations of any of the following statutes:
The Shore Protection Act (33 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.); The Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.); The Marine
Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.); The Rivers and Harbors Appropriation
Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401 et seq.); or The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). SPA directs
the USCG to provide a hearing process for denial, suspension or revocation of a permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing these regulations to set waste handling practices for municipal and commercial waste transported
in U.S. coastal waters. SPA permits will require the permittee to comply with these EPA regulations when they are promulgated
in final form.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules draw on experience from the State of New York (6 NYCRR Part 360, Solid Waste Management Facilities
Document for Solid Waste and Semi-solid Waste Handling Practices), and from the State of Louisiana (Regulation 29&hyph;B,
section pertaining to permitting of vessels that haul municipal and commercial waste). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USCG has issued interim final regulations which prescribe permit application requirements for SPA permits (33
CFR part 151). The regulations proposed today are designed to work in concert with the USCG permit regulations to implement
SPA. These regulations apply in addition to, and not in lieu of, all applicable requirements under any other statutes.

II. Detailed Discussion of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 237.1, as proposed, essentially restates the regulatory authority given to EPA under section 4103(b) of
SPA. It requires EPA to prescribe regulations that provide methods to minimize waste deposits into coastal waters
during loading, offloading, and transport. It provides for the development and submission, as appropriate, of an
Operation and Maintenance manual that will identify procedures to prevent, report and clean up deposits of waste
and keep records. Moreover, it allows the Administrator to require owners or operators of waste sources, vessels,
and receiving facilities to operate a tracking system if the Administrator determines them necessary to assure adequate
compliance with SPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except for those exemptions described below, these proposed regulations apply to all owners and operators of vessels
transporting municipal or commercial waste in coastal waters; waste sources from which municipal or commercial
waste is loaded onto a vessel in coastal waters; and receiving facilities to which municipal or commercial waste is
offloaded from a vessel in coastal waters. Coastal waters is defined in the statute (SPA section 4101(2)) and in proposed
&sect;237.3(b). Where there is ambiguity on the applicability of SPA, we are providing clarification below.

Proposed &sect;237.2 states that the rule would apply to vessels which transport municipal or commercial waste in
coastal waters. Owners or operators of these vessels are required, among other things, to obtain permits from the
USCG, and to assure that any deposit of waste into coastal waters from the vessel during transport is minimized. The
preamble to the USCG's interim permitting regulations states that a vessel which regularly transports miscellaneous
cargo in coastal waters but is hired to transport municipal or commercial waste for a specific voyage is required to
have a permit to transport the municipal or commercial waste for that voyage. A SPA permit and compliance with waste
handling requirements of this rule (when finalized) are required of the vessel where the predominant business or
purpose of the vessel 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
for that voyage 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is transportation of municipal or commercial waste (54 FR 22546, 22547, May 24, 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing this regulation, EPA has worked with the USCG to identify vessels that have applied for SPA permits.
In doing so, it became clear that there are vessels currently transporting municipal and commercial waste that have
not applied for a permit under the USCG permitting requirements. For example, EPA is aware of a number of vessels that
support the offshore oil and gas industry by transporting packaged garbage, drilling fluids, and drill cuttings
from oil and gas platforms and developed and undeveloped lease blocks in coastal waters to shore for disposal. EPA
believes that these vessels fall within the scope of SPA because they are transporting commercial waste in coastal
waters. Therefore, EPA believes that vessels which are used, contracted, or hired to transport oil field municipal
and commercial waste from offshore development and production facilities to shore reception facilities, commonly
referred to as ``supply vessels,'' are required to comply with these regulations, when promulgated in final form.
After consulting with the USCG, the agency has been informed that the USCG believes that these ``supply vessels''
are also subject to the permitting requirements under 33 CFR part 151, subpart B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vessels used, contracted or hired for the purpose of pumping sewage from other vessels are also covered by these regulations.
The Agency considered excluding these pump-out vessels from the universe of regulated entities to encourage their
use, but concluded that the requirements imposed by these regulations are minimal, and should not discourage the
use of pump-out vessels.

Section 4102(a) of SPA clearly exempts public vessels from this regulation. Section 237.2(b)(1), as proposed, supports
this exemption by restating that these regulations do not apply to such vessels (as defined in 33 CFR 151.1006). ``Public
vessels'' are defined as vessels that are owned or demise chartered and operated by the United States government or
a government of a foreign country and are not engaged in commercial service. SPA states that vessels as defined in section
2101 of title 46 of the United States Code are not required to apply for a SPA permit to transport municipal or commercial
waste in coastal waters or comply with this rule. Note that a public vessel would not include a vessel owned by a municipality.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, these proposed regulations would not apply to vessels which transport some quantity of municipal or
commercial waste incidental to the predominant business or purpose of the vessel. For example, a ferry transporting
people and vehicles which also transports a garbage truck loaded with municipal or commercial waste is not required
to apply for a SPA permit and would be exempt from complying with this rule. In this example, the ferry's predominant
business or purpose is not waste transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conference report on P.L. 100&hyph;688 states that SPA was intended ``only to apply to vessels whose purpose is
the transportation of municipal or commercial waste, not all vessels. It was not intended to apply to vessels that
may generate waste during their `normal operations'.'' Examples of vessels exempt from this rule because of the normal
operation exemption would be a cruise ship and a fishing vessel, both of which transport waste generated by the crew
and passengers during a voyage. This ``normal operation'' exemption is set forth in section 4101(3)(B) of SPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If normal operational waste meeting the definition of municipal or commercial waste is transferred from the generating
vessel to another vessel contracted to transport waste, the vessel receiving the municipal or commercial waste is
subject to the requirements of SPA as a vessel and receiving facility and must comply with requirements under these
regulations when finalized. The waste generating vessel is not regulated under SPA. This clarification allows vessels,
such as cruise ships and fishing vessels, to offload their normal operational waste without being subject to SPA requirements.

Waste Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SPA section 4103(a)(1) requires owners or operators of waste sources to take all reasonable steps to assure that all
municipal or commercial waste is loaded onto a vessel in a manner that assures that waste deposited into coastal waters
is minimized. There are a variety of entities that handle municipal or commercial waste that are considered waste
sources for purposes of these regulations. These include trucks, certain vessels, waste transfer stations, and
island docks or piers. The following provides some examples of how and when this regulation applies to some of these
waste sources. Offshore oil and gas exploration platforms will not be considered waste sources under SPA, for the
reasons set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A truck transporting municipal or commercial waste will be considered a waste source (i.e., rolling stock or motor
vehicle) if it directly loads its waste onto a vessel. If a truck will be transferring municipal or commercial waste
to a vessel by means of a waste transfer station, EPA is proposing in &sect;237.2(b)(4) that the truck not be considered
a waste source, and therefore not be subject to the requirements of these regulations on its own. Instead, the waste
transfer station would be considered the waste source responsible for ensuring that the waste transfer meets the
waste handling standards for these regulations. Section 237.4(e)(1)(ii) should be interpreted to require the owner
or operator of a waste source to incorporate guidelines in the Operation and Maintenance manual that accounts for
the truck or vessel transfer. The waste transfer station more typically will have the necessary equipment and personnel
to comply with these regulations. Rolling stock and motor vehicles typically are not equipped with containment or
diversionary structures e.g. dip nets, oily water separators etc., and will not, in most cases, be able to comply with
requirements being proposed in &sect;237.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the situation where waste is transferred from an offshore oil and gas development and production facility, the
oil and gas facility is not a waste source for purposes of these regulations. That transfer is governed by the Clean
Water Act (National Pollution Discharge Elimination System), which regulates, among other things, the discharge
of pollutants from point sources, including offshore oil and gas development and production facilities, and the
Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act (MPPRCA) which governs the regulation of garbage generated by
ships. Under the Clean Water Act, EPA has promulgated effluent limitation guidelines and new source performance
standards for the offshore oil and gas industry (58 FR 12453, March 4, 1993). Coverage of these offshore oil and gas
development and production facilities under SPA would be duplicative and unnecessary.

Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 237.3 lays out definitions to be used to interpret and implement these regulations. Some of the definitions
are the same as the definitions in SPA. Others are clarifications or additions to those definitions. Unless otherwise
noted, those terms are consistent with USCG definitions under 33 CFR part 151. The definitions proposed today that
are different or in addition to those in SPA include definitions for the terms waste source, receiving facility, operator,
owner, SPA, waste deposit, and waste transfer station. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes to include within the coverage of this regulation a typical waste transfer from vessel to vessel (with
exceptions noted in the discussion of vessels excluded under the applicability section) by including the term ``vessel''
in the definition of waste source and the definition of receiving facility. This is clearly within the intent of the
statute. Vessels which transfer municipal or commercial waste to other vessels, unless excluded as described above,
will be required to comply with these regulations as a waste source or receiving facility (depending on whether the
transfer is loading onto or offloading from the vessel) and to clean up waste deposited into U.S. coastal waters as
a result of inadequate waste transport or transfer practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``vessel'' includes non self-propelled vessels and the attendant towing vessel. This is included
to ensure that barges tied to a towing vessel are covered by these regulations. They would be considered one vessel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``waste source'' includes any rolling stock or motor vehicles from which waste is directly loaded
onto vessels. As explained 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, once rolling stock (e.g., a garbage truck) enters a waste transfer station, the transfer station, and not the rolling
stock would be the sole waste source responsible for all appropriate waste handling practices and requirements under
these proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that the definition of ``municipal and commercial waste'' is proposed as defined in section 4103 of SPA, as ``solid
waste'' and includes solid, semi-solid, and liquid materials (as defined in section 1004 of the Solid Waste Disposal
Act, 42 U.S.C. 6903), with exceptions as defined in Section 4101(3) of SPA. It also includes waste drilling fluids
and drill cuttings.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;237.4 would require the owner or operator of a waste source or receiving facility to: (1) Meet standards
related to loading and offloading municipal or commercial waste to assure that any deposit of waste in coastal waters
is minimized; (2) provide methods and procedures to promptly clean up waste deposited in coastal waters; (3) have
fixed lighting; (4) develop, adopt, and submit, as appropriate, an Operation and Maintenance manual; and (5) maintain
records of waste deposited in coastal waters. EPA considered other alternatives to the regulations proposed today,
such as identifying specific methods and tools for clean up required by the regulations instead of generic waste handling
practice standards. Rather than require the use of specific methods or tools, EPA believes that the generic waste
handling practices contained in the proposed regulations, if promulgated in final form, will be sufficient to eliminate
the waste problems resulting from inadequate municipal and commercial waste handling activities in coastal waters
while preserving necessary flexibility on how to best achieve that result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the proposed waste handling practices for waste sources and receiving facilities are requirements for containment
or diversionary structures. EPA believes this equipment, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, booms, dip nets, and oily water separating equipment, is necessary to control or contain the waste that is deposited
in coastal waters. In addition, EPA proposes that waste sources and receiving facilities must have fixed lighting
when conducting loading and offloading operations between sunset and sunrise. Such lighting is necessary to provide
waste handling personnel with the visual ability to control and contain waste transfers with a minimum of improper
disposal into coastal waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also contains requirements for owner or operators of waste sources and receiving facilities to clean
up all municipal or commercial waste that may have been deposited into coastal waters during loading or offloading.
EPA is proposing that such clean up must occur before the first high tide after the disposal occurs. EPA believes that
requiring this time frame for the clean up is appropriate because otherwise the waste would disperse at high tide beyond
the waste source or receiving facilities' ability to contain or control the waste. Among the cleanup methods set forth
in the proposed rule are sweeper boats, manned boats with nets, booms or other equipment, and/or shoreline cleanup
personnel. The proposed rule would require that cleanup resources be in continuous operation or on standby for loading
and offloading operations which take place during an ebb tide. EPA believes that this requirement will ensure that
waste that is deposited into coastal waters is contained or controlled before it has the chance to disperse with an
ebb tide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also would require waste sources and receiving facilities to have a placard located at the facility which
is readily visible to persons involved in waste handling practices. Such placard would need to display the name and
telephone number of the individual responsible for notifying the USCG National Response Center (NRC) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;424&hyph;8802
in the event of a deposit of waste into coastal waters that is not cleaned up. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPA section 4103(b)(2) provides that the Administrator may require responsible parties to submit Operation and
Maintenance manuals, as appropriate. EPA proposes to require that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 waste sources and receiving facilities covered under SPA (with the exceptions noted in &sect;237.2), develop and
adopt these manuals and that each of the waste sources and receiving facilities submit to the EPA a letter certifying
that the manual was developed in accordance with the guidelines provided. The Operation and Maintenance manual shall
then be submitted to the Administrator only upon request, and, if requested, within two weeks of the request by the
Administrator for the manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives, such as requiring the submission of operation and maintenance manuals by a subset of the regulated
community, or ``as appropriate,'' depending on the circumstances, would be difficult to implement and more likely
an obstacle to meeting the intent of SPA. The development of operation and maintenance manuals by all of the regulated
community will ensure that owners and operators are aware of waste handling procedures, including who shall be responsible
for the cleanup of waste deposits, notification and reporting requirements, and equipment needed to contain and
or clean up a waste deposit. Submission of manuals upon request will help assure that there is a minimum standard of
waste handling practices for the regulated community. To facilitate implementation of this requirement, EPA is
proposing as an appendix to this regulation information on developing an operation and maintenance manual. The proposal
leaves the content of the manual flexible_each responsible party will develop its own procedures and document these
procedures in the manual, following the general guidance in the appendix. EPA encourages those that have already
developed operation and maintenance manuals consistent with the guidelines prescribed in Appendix A to use these
manuals. Those that have not yet developed a relevant operation and maintenance manual are encouraged to use the guidelines
provided in Appendix A to develop a manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, the Administrator or the Secretary may review these manuals and either accept the manual or reject
the manual with comment if the manual fails to provide the necessary information prescribed in the regulations. Operations
may continue during this review process. Failure to develop an operation and maintenance manual, or to follow the
procedures adopted in the facility's manual, would be a violation of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Operation and Maintenance manual must include procedures for notifying the USCG in the event of a deposit of regulated
waste into coastal waters that is beyond the capacity of the owner or operator to clean up. In addition, it must identify
an individual responsible for such notification. This individual must be designated by the owner or operator of the
waste source or receiving facility. The identification of this person and his or her responsibilities shall provide
a process for reporting and requesting assistance in the case of a deposit beyond the capacity of the waste source,
vessel or receiving facility to contain and clean up after implementing clean up procedures outlined in the operation
and maintenance manual. The responsible individual must be a supervisory employee responsible for waste handling
activities or an officer of the company owning or operating the waste source, vessel or receiving facility, who is
responsible for some aspect of waste handling activities (e.g. vice president in charge of operations). Therefore,
the responsible individual can be an owner or operator of the company. When a municipal or commercial waste deposit
is beyond the capacity of the regulated entity to clean up after implementing the clean up procedures outlined in the
Operation and Maintenance manual, the responsible individual is accountable for notifying the USCG NRC in the case
of a deposit of waste into coastal waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations would require that the Operation and Maintenance manual be accessible to all employees involved
in waste handling activities. In addition to the notification requirements, any person witnessing a deposit of municipal
or commercial waste into coastal waters is encouraged to contact the USCG NRC when it is suspected that there is a violation
of these regulations. Owners and operators are encouraged to put this USCG NRC number on the placard.

Specific Waste Handling Practices for Vessels During Transport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;237.5 provides a standard for waste handling practices for vessels during transport of municipal
or commercial waste in coastal waters. This standard requires that the owner or operator ensure that the deposit of
waste into coastal waters from a vessel is minimized. For example, open hopper barges transporting municipal solid
waste could comply by covering the entire open area of the hopper barge with a net suitable for minimizing waste deposits
into coastal waters during transport. In addition to meeting this standard, all vessels requiring a SPA permit will
be required to submit an Operation and Maintenance manual to the appropriate USCG office with their permit application.
The permittee or applicant should call the USCG NRC to obtain the address of the appropriate USCG office for the area
in which the vessel will operate. The owners or operators of vessels which have already obtained a conditional permit
under the USCG interim permitting rule (33 CFR Part 151) would be required to submit an Operation and Maintenance manual
within 180 days of the effective date of the rule. Owners and operators of vessels not yet permitted would need to submit
an Operation and Maintenance manual at the time they submit a permit application to the USCG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation and Maintenance manual requirements for vessels are similar to those proposed for waste sources and receiving
facilities discussed above. EPA considered requiring vessel owners and operators to submit to the USCG a letter certifying
the development of the Operation and Maintenance manual rather than the manual itself; however, EPA decided that
because vessels are required to submit an application for a permit it is logical to include a copy of their manual. Submission
of the manual with the permit application ensures that the permit applicant has fully considered these waste handling
practices, cleanup measures, record keeping, and reporting requirements and has documented them accordingly.
Guidance for development of a vessel Operation and Maintenance manual is found in Appendix A of this proposal. Failure
to develop an Operation and Maintenance manual is a violation of SPA and these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that the owner or operator of a vessel subject to this regulation must secure the waste to ensure that
deposit in coastal waters is minimized. In particular, vessels must not be loaded in excess of their design capacity
or in a manner inconsistent with the vessel's Operation and Maintenance manual. Loading of a vessel in excess of its
capacity would clearly pose risks of waste deposition in coastal waters. In addition, the proposal contains a provision
which would require vessels to have and use a drainage containment system. Such a system will reduce the amount of leachate
discharge into coastal waters. EPA is also proposing that all ports and valves which may be used for flushing or discharging
waste residue from the hull or tanks must be labelled and valve seals shall be placed on the valves. This requirement
would ensure that waste handling personnel would easily be able to control the movement of leachate and waste on the
vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing that owners or operators of vessels remove all municipal or commercial waste deposited into
coastal waters during transport, or, when appropriate, during the waste transfer. This proposal also would require
the vessels to have the capability on board to clean up the waste deposited or to call a support unit to clean up the waste
deposited. In addition, as EPA proposed for waste sources and receiving facilities, the proposal would require vessels
to have a placard located on board which is readily visible to persons involved in waste handling practices. The placard
would have to display the name and telephone number of the individual responsible for notifying the USCG NRC of a deposit
of waste in coastal waters that is beyond their capacity to clean up. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposal would require vessel owners or operators to maintain records of municipal or commercial waste
deposited in coastal waters. The records are to include information on the date and time of day the deposit occurred;
the type of waste deposited; the estimated amount and type of waste recovered; and the name of the vessel from which
the deposit occurred. Section 4103(b)(2) authorizes EPA to include record keeping requirements in the regulations,
and the Agency believes that such requirements are reasonable, and will encourage proper handling of waste so that
deposits into U.S. coastal waters do not occur. Similar requirements have been proposed for the owners and operators
of waste sources and receiving facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with waste handling practices proposed for waste sources and receiving facilities, EPA considered alternatives
to regulating these vessels, such as specific procedures and equipment required on board a vessel. Because of the
variability in nature of municipal and commercial waste transported, in addition to the variety of vessels, waste
sources and receiving facilities affected by this rule, EPA chose to propose a waste handling practice standard alternative
today that is flexible yet sufficient to carry out the goals of the statute.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4103(b)(3) of SPA allows for tracking systems to be required if the Administrator determines that tracking
systems will be necessary to assure adequate enforcement of the requirements in SPA and these regulations. EPA, in
consultation with the USCG, conducted a study on the need for tracking systems for vessels transporting municipal
and commercial waste. The results of this study are documented in a Report to Congress submitted by EPA in August of
1992, titled ``The Need for Tracking Systems on Vessels Transporting Municipal or Commercial Wastes.'' EPA is proposing
to follow the recommendation outlined in that report and require a tracking system in the future only if deemed necessary
by the Administrator (on a case-by-case basis). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing in &sect;237.6 today that a tracking system may be required for owners and operators of waste sources,
vessels, and receiving facilities which have been identified as persistent violators. In determining whether to
require a tracking system, EPA is proposing that the Administrator consider the following variables: (1) The owner's
and operator's history of compliance with SPA; (2) the owner's and operator's history of compliance with other environmental
statutes; (3) the characteristics and amounts of waste transported; and (4) the feasibility of installing a specific
kind of tracking system.

Sections 4105 and 4108 of SPA give the Secretary of Transportation the authority to enforce the requirements of SPA
and assess penalties. The Secretary has delegated this authority to the USCG. Under SPA, EPA also is provided authority
under sections 4105 and 4104 to: (1) Conduct investigations of an owner or operator of a vessel or facility if the owner
or operator has five or more separate violations during a six-month period; and (2) request that the Secretary of Transportation
suspend or revoke a permit issued to a vessel for a violation of SPA or regulations promulgated under SPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPA section 4108 states that after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, a person found by the Secretary of Transportation
to have violated the SPA or a regulation promulgated under it for which a civil penalty is provided is liable to the United
States for the civil penalty so provided. 33 U.S.C. section 2608(a). Section 4109 of the SPA establishes that a person
who violates SPA requirements is liable to the United States government for a civil penalty of not more than $25,000.
33 U.S.C. Section 2609(a). The Act specifies that each day of a continuing violation is a separate violation.

Proposed &sect;237.7(a) codifies the notice and opportunity for a hearing provisions from the statutory language
of SPA section 4108(a). The legislative history of SPA makes it clear that the assessment of civil penalties should
not require an ``on the record'' hearing within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. H. Conf. Rep. No.
100&hyph;1090, at 46 (Oct. 18, 1988). As noted above, the USCG has been delegated the authority to enforce the requirements
of SPA, and the legislative history specifically cites the USCG civil penalty procedural rules under 33 CFR 1.07 as
providing the appropriate level of due process, notice, and opportunity to be heard.

 Thus, &sect;237.7(a) of the proposed rule specifies that prior to issuing a SPA civil penalty, notice and an opportunity
for a hearing will be conducted in accordance with the Coast Guard's civil penalty procedures. The Coast Guard has
indicated to EPA its intent to utilize the procedures in 33 CFR 1.07 for imposition of civil penalties under SPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 237.7(b) provides the legal authority for the imposition of a civil penalty for any violation of the substantive
provisions of part 237 by restating the statutory penalty level provided in section 4109(a) of SPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the ``person'' liable for penalties, section 4104(c) broadly defines the term ``person'' to mean an
``individual, trust, firm, joint stock company, corporation (including a government corporation), partnership,
association, state, municipality, commission, political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body.'' 33 U.S.C.
2604(4). Under the terms of &sect;237.3, any of such ``persons'' could qualify as an owner or operator of a regulated
entity, and be subject to the assessment of civil penalties by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), The Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, whenever an agency is developing regulations, it must prepare and make available for public comment the impact of
the regulations on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions).
However, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required if the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Agency has prepared a Regulatory
Impact Analysis (RIA). This RIA shows that the estimated first year cost is approximately $1,609,000 for vessels,
waste sources, and receiving facilities. Annual costs during the next 5 years are estimated at $249,000 for vessels,
waste sources, and receiving facilities. The average first year costs per vessel of $253&hyph;$1,413 are not considered
significant. The average first year costs for waste sources and receiving facilities are estimated at $126&hyph;$2,316.
The largest share of compliance costs, measured as first year costs, will be for waste transport vessels, primarily
supply boats transporting muds and packaged garbage from offshore rigs. Based on EPA's analysis of the effected regulated
community, I certify that this proposed rule imposes no significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small
entities.

Appendix A_Guidance on Operation and Maintenance Manuals for Waste Sources, Vessels and Receiving Facilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This appendix provides a basic structure for the development of operation and maintenance manuals for the regulated
entities. The operation and maintenance manual developed by a vessel permitted under the Shore Protection Act, or
associated waste source and receiving facility should be a clear statement of: (1) operation and maintenance procedures
for preventing waste from accidentally spilling into coastal waters of the United States, (2) clean up procedures
the regulated entity will follow when a waste deposit does occur, and (3) reporting procedures the regulated entity
will follow when a waste deposit does occur. Each regulated vessel, or associated waste source and receiving facility
should develop an operation and maintenance manual to suit its particular characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The owners or operators of the following vessels (unless excluded, as discussed below) are required to develop
and submit an operation and maintenance manual (&sect;237.2(a)): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A vessel transporting municipal or commercial waste in coastal waters; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Vessels that regularly transport miscellaneous cargo but are hired, contracted, or used to transport municipal
or commercial waste for a specific voyage; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Vessels that transport operational waste from other vessels that meet the definition of municipal or commercial
waste_this does not include vessels transporting their own operational wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The owners or operators of the following vessels, and some others, are excluded from developing and submitting
operation and maintenance manuals (&sect;237.2(b) for full list of exclusions): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Public vessels, defined as vessels that are owned, demise chartered, and operated by the United States Government
or a government of a foreign party, and do not engage in commercial service; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Vessels that transport some quantity of waste incidental to the predominant business or purpose of the vessel.
For example, a ferry which transports a garbage truck loaded with municipal or commercial waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The owners or operators of waste sources and receiving facilities, as defined below and in section 237.3(g) and
(l) are required to develop and submit (upon request) an operation and maintenance manual: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A facility, vessel, or operation that receives municipal or commercial waste unloaded from a vessel; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A vessel or a facility from which municipal or commercial waste is loaded onto a vessel, including any rolling stock
or motor vehicles from which that waste is directly loaded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. The Manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The structure and detail of each operation and maintenance manual may vary as the vessel, waste source, or receiving
facility will vary and as the type of waste transferred and transported will vary. As a result of the variation in the
physical nature of municipal and commercial waste, the structure and requirements provided in this appendix are
necessarily generic and will require further elaboration based on the specifics of the operations and maintenance
nuances at your facility, source, or vessel. However, it is expected that an operation and maintenance manual meeting
the minimum requirements of this regulation need not exceed 20 to 30 pages in length.

III. Operation and Maintenance Manuals for Vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The operation and maintenance manual for vessels consists of three parts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Waste transfer procedures; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Waste clean up procedures; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Waste deposit reporting procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The first part of the operation and maintenance manual shall identify the measures that you will take to minimize
the deposit of waste into coastal waters during transport and transfer activities. In the operation and maintenance
manual you should (&sect;237.5(d)(ii)): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Describe the roles and responsibilities of each relevant member of the crew during waste transfer and transport.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provide a detailed step-wise description to the vessel crew on the implementation of the technologies and techniques
that will be employed during waste transfer and transport. These should include appropriate containment or diversionary
structures, or other equipment designed to minimize waste deposits. The technologies and techniques described
shall be appropriate to the size and nature of the vessel and must represent a responsible effort to minimize the spillage
of waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Instruct the crew to secure the waste in such a way as to prevent the deposit of waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Direct the crew not to load the vessel in excess of its capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Direct the crew that all ports and valves that may be used for flushing or discharging waste or waste residue from
the hull or tanks must be clearly labelled and that all ports and valves must be sealed except for the purpose of transferring
wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Describe record keeping procedures, i.e. record of amount and type of waste offloaded, or amount and type of waste
received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provide a detailed step-wise description to relevant employees on the implementation of technologies and techniques
that will be employed during waste transfer. These should include appropriate containment or diversionary structures,
or other equipment designed to minimize waste deposits. The technologies or techniques described must be appropriate
to the waste type and size and nature of the vessels loaded/unloaded, and represent a responsible effort to minimize
the deposit of wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Describe record keeping procedures, i.e record of amount and type of waste offloaded, or amount and type of waste
received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The second part of the operation and maintenance manual describes for your employees the procedures that will be

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This action proposes to amend Food Stamp Program regulations to implement several provisions of the Mickey Leland
Childhood Hunger Relief Act. The provisions in this proposal would: simplify the household definition; establish
eligibility for children who live with their food stamp eligible parents in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation center;
exclude from resources the value of vehicles used to transport fuel or water; increase the fair market value exclusion
of vehicles for determining a household's resource limit; exclude certain general assistance vendor payments;
exclude the earnings of students under age 22 who live with their parents; increase the maximum amount of the dependent
care deduction; eliminate the current Federally imposed limit and require State agencies to establish a statewide
limit on the dependent care reimbursement paid to participants in the Food Stamp Employment and Training Program;
and require proration of benefits only after a break of more than one month in certification.

The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under No. 10.551. For the reasons
set forth in the proposed rule and related notices of 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V (48 FR 29115), this Program is excluded
from the scope of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This proposed rule is not intended to have retroactive effect
unless so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In
the Food Stamp Program, the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) For Program benefit recipients_State
administrative procedures issued to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative
procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities)
or part 275 (for rules related to QC liabilities); (3) for Program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures

The Department has also reviewed this proposed rule in relation to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). Ellen Haas, Assistant Secretary for Food and
Consumer Services, has certified that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. The proposed requirements will affect food stamp applicants and recipients and the State and local
agencies that administer the Program. Eligibility criteria will be simplified and some currently participating
households will realize an increase in Program benefits.

Need for Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This action is required as a result of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act which amends the Food Stamp Act
of 1977, as amended, to include provisions that would: (1) Simplify the household definition; (2) establish eligibility
for children who live with their food stamp eligible parents in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation center; (3) exclude
from resources the value of vehicles used to transport fuel or water; (4) increase the fair market value exclusion
of vehicles for determining a household's resource limit; (5) exclude certain general assistance vendor payments;
(6) exclude the earnings of students under age 22 who live with their parents; (7) increase the maximum amount of the
dependent care deduction; (8) eliminate the current Federally imposed limit and require State agencies to establish
a statewide limit on the dependent care reimbursement paid to participants in the Food Stamp Employment and Training
Program; and (9) require proration of benefits only in the initial month of certification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing a public hearing on January 20, 1994. The public hearing was scheduled to provide an opportunity for State
agencies, advocacy groups, and other interested parties to engage in public dialogue on issues concerning the regulatory
provisions that are to be published in connection with the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (Act) amendments made by the Mickey
Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act, Chapter 3, Title XIII, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66,
enacted August 10, 1993 (Leland Act). All provisions of the Leland Act pertinent to the Food Stamp Program (Program)
were included as topics of dialogue during the public hearing, including the provisions contained in this proposed
rulemaking.

Simplifying the Household Definition for Households with Children and Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Food Stamp Act of 1977 was enacted, the concept of a ``household'' was defined as: (1) An individual living
alone; (2) an individual living with others but customarily purchasing food and preparing meals for home consumption
separate and apart from the others; (3) an individual who is a boarder living with others and paying reasonable compensation
to the others for meals for home consumption; (4) a group of individuals living together for whom food is customarily
purchased in common and for whom meals are prepared together for home consumption; or (5) a group of individuals who
are boarders, living with others and paying reasonable compensation to the others for meals for home consumption.
Separate household status was not granted to a spouse of a household member, or to children under 18 years of age under
the parental control of a member of the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 101 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;35) amended section 3(i) of the Act to
provide that parents and children living together could be considered as separate households if they purchase and
prepare meals separately, but only if at least one parent is 60 years of age or older or is disabled. The final rule to
implement this revision was published on March 28, 1986 (51 FR 10764). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 142 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;253) amended section 3(i) of the Act
to provide that siblings living together had to be included in the same household unless at least one of the siblings
is elderly or disabled and they purchased and prepared their meals separately. The Department construed the term
``siblings'' to include natural, adopted, half or step-siblings. The final rule to implement this revision was published
on March 28, 1986 (51 FR 10764). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1987, section 802 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;77) (McKinney Act)
amended section 3(i) of the Food Stamp Act to provide an exception to the parent-child rule which allows three generations
living together to form two separate households if the parent with minor children and the minor children are purchasing
and preparing meals separately from the minor children's grandparent(s). The McKinney Act also provided an exception
to the sibling rule which allowed two siblings living together to form two separate households if one sibling is a parent
of minor children in residence and the parent and minor children purchase and prepare meals separately from the parent's
sibling. The Department considered children under 18 years of age who are under the parental control of an adult household
member to be minors. In addition, section 802 of the McKinney Act specifically provided that such households be subject
to reexamination at least once every six months. Accordingly, the Department published a final rule at 58 FR 58444
to implement these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13931 of the Leland Act amended section 3(i) of the Food Stamp Act to require that persons who live together
and purchase food and prepare meals separately may apply as separate households, except for (1) spouses who live together,
(2) parents and their children 21 years of age or younger (who are not themselves parents living with their children
or married and living with their spouses), and (3) children (excluding foster children) under 18 years of age who live
with and are under the parental control of a person other than their parent. These groups shall be treated as a group
of individuals who customarily purchase and prepare meals together for home consumption even if they do not do so.
The parent/child and siblings provisions of 7 CFR 273.1(a) are no longer valid. The provision of section 3(i) of the
Act which grants separate household status to individuals who are 60 years of age or older and unable to purchase food
and prepare meals, was not changed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress amended the household definition for several reasons. According to the legislative history cited below,
the current household definition was too ``convoluted,'' thereby making it ``needlessly complex and error-prone.''
In addition, the current household definition did not recognize that more and more families and individuals must
share housing because of high housing costs or unemployment. The legislative history further states that the change
in household definition would remove the burden imposed on relatives who ``double up'' but still purchase food and
prepare meals separately. (House Report No. 111, 103rd Congress, lst session (199), p.34). Congress also prohibited
minor children who are under the parental control of an adult household member from establishing a separate household.
This prohibition prevents minor children from being treated as separate households when they are in the care of adults,
whether or not legal adoption has taken place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is planning to retain the current language regarding the rule that, with a few exceptions, persons
who live together and purchase food and prepare meals together are one household. The Department is proposing to revise
the exceptions which require some related individuals to be included in the same household even if they purchase food
and prepare meals separately. Under the proposal, spouses who live together must be considered one household. Natural,
adopted, and stepchildren and other children under 18 years of age who are under the parental control of a member of
the household, other than a parent, must be included in the same household as the parent or other person with parental
control even if they purchase food and prepare meals separately unless the child is living with his or her own children
or is married and living with his or her spouse. In addition, children ages 18, 19, 20, and 21 who are natural, adopted,
or stepchildren must be included in the same household as the parent even if they purchase food and prepare meals separately,
unless the child is living with his or her children or is married and living with his or her spouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Food Stamp Program Policy Memo 3&hyph;93&hyph;6 dated March 26, 1993, children under parental control
for food stamp eligibility purposes are ``minors who are dependents_financial or otherwise_of the household as
opposed to independent units.'' This definition was intended to transcend State laws which vary widely on parental
control. The Department is proposing to amend this definition to specify that children who are married and living
with their spouse are not under parental control and, further, that children who are living with children of their
own are not under parental control. This will provide the same treatment for children under 18 living with an adult
other than a parent that is provided for natural, adopted and stepchildren; i.e., they may be a separate household
if they are living with their children or married and living with their spouse and they purchase and prepare their meals
separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2) (i)(B) through (D) accordingly. The Department is also proposing
two conforming amendments. The first proposed conforming amendment would amend 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2)(ii) to include
a reference to 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2)(i)(C). The second proposed amendment would amend 7 CFR 273.10(f)(2), which mandates
certification periods of up to six months for households meeting the parent/child or siblings provision of 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2)(i)(C)
and (D). The Department proposes to remove this section because this requirement was removed from the Food Stamp Act
when the household definition was changed. The Department is proposing no change to paragraph 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2)(i)(A)
regarding the grouping of spouses since the rule is unaffected by the Leland Act.

Eligibility of Children of Parents Participating in Drug or Alcohol Treatment Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 3(i) of the Food Stamp Act, food stamp benefits are authorized for narcotic addicts or alcoholics who
live under the supervision of a private non-profit institution for the purpose of regular participation in a drug
or alcoholic treatment program. Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.1(f)(2) (i) and (ii) permit residents of alcohol
or drug treatment centers to apply as a one-person household and be certified for food stamps through the use of an authorized
representative who is an employee of and designated by the publicly operated community mental health center or the
private non-profit organization or institution that is administering the treatment and rehabilitation program.
According to the Act at section 3(i) and 7 CFR 273.1(e), spouses and children living with residents of alcohol or drug
treatment centers are not eligible if the center provides the majority of their meals. If the center does not provide
the majority of their meals, the spouses and children may qualify for food stamps as a separate household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the implementation of this regulation, there have been changes in some drug and alcohol treatment centers'
policy regarding addicts and their children. Previously, addicts with children were required to leave them with
family or friends, or place them in foster care since children were not permitted to remain with their parents during
treatment. Now, several residential treatment programs permit addicts with children to live as a family unit while
the parents participate in treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While some residential treatment programs accept addicts and their children, the Food Stamp Act did not authorize
benefits for these children even though their parents were eligible for food stamps when the center provided the majority
of their meals. In the past, the Department received several waiver requests from State agencies to add children who
live with their parent(s) while the parent(s) is (are) a resident(s) of an alcohol or drug treatment center to the parent's
food stamp household. But the provisions of the Food Stamp Act did not permit the Department to waive the regulations
for these children.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13932 of the Leland Act amended the Food Stamp Act to provide Food Stamp Program eligibility to children living
with their eligible parent(s) in a drug or alcohol treatment center regardless of whether or not the center provides
the majority of the children's meals. The children would be considered part of the parent's household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the household definition stated in section 13931 of the Leland Act, parents and their natural, adopted or stepchildren
21 years of age or younger are considered one household except when the child under 21 is living with his/her children
or is married and living with his/her spouse. Then the child's household can be considered a separate household from
that of the parent(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of parents and children living in a drug or alcohol treatment center, the circumstances are different.
In the course of discussion during the January 20, 1994 public hearing, one State agency representative asked that
children and parents living in residential drug or alcohol treatment programs be considered separate households.
The State agency representative explained that the State agency provided different funding amount for meals served
to adults and children living in residential drug or alcohol treatment centers. Permitting separate household status
for the parents and children residing in these treatment centers would provide the State agency with an easy method
for calculating and issuing food stamp benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered these comments and believes that there are significant problems with this suggested
policy of granting separate household status to parents and children living in residential drug or alcohol treatment
centers even though such a policy may be less complicated for a particular State agency. The revised household definition
of section 13931 of the Leland Act requires parents and children under 21 years of age to be considered one household
with two exceptions. Therefore, to provide separate household status to parents and children under 21 who live together
in a residential drug or alcohol treatment center would violate section 13931 of the Leland Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, under current regulations at 7 CFR 273.1(f)(2), residents of drug or alcohol treatment centers are permitted
to apply for food stamps through an authorized representative. If parents and children living in a drug or alcohol
treatment program were treated as separate households, problems resulting from the need for authorized representatives
for both the parent and child could become very confusing. Under 7 CFR 273.1(f)(2), the authorized representative
for residents of a drug or alcohol treatment center must be an employee of the institution administering the treatment
program. The Department believes that it was the intent of Congress to include parents and children in the same household
even when the parent is in a drug or alcohol treatment center. By including the parent and child in the same household,
the parent's income would be counted only once and no authorized representative would be needed for the child. Currently,
residents of a drug or alcohol treatment center are certified through an authorized representative of the center.
The Department believes that the authorized representative of the center should represent the entire household
while the household lives in the center and the center provides the majority of its meals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.1(e)(1)(ii) to extend food stamp eligibility to children
of narcotic addicts or alcoholics who are residents of drug or alcohol treatment centers. Conforming language is
also being proposed to include children of narcotic addicts or alcoholics in the ``Eligible foods'' definition of
7 CFR 271.2 so that these children will become eligible for meals served to eligible households by drug or alcohol rehabilitation
centers. A conforming amendment is also being proposed to 7 CFR 273.1(f)(2).

Vehicles Necessary to Carry Fuel or Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, a vehicle is totally exempt from being counted as a resource if it is used primarily (over 50 percent of the
time) for income producing purposes; annually produces income consistent with its fair market value; necessary
for long-distance travel, other than daily commuting, that is essential to the employment of a household member;
used as the household's home; or is necessary to transport a physically disabled household member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13923 of the Leland Act amended section 5(g)(2) of the Act to exclude from resources the value of a vehicle that
a household depends upon to carry fuel for heating or water for home use when such transported fuel or water is the primary
source of fuel or water for the household. It is the intent of Congress that households without heating fuel or piped
water into their homes receive this resource exclusion without having to meet any additional tests concerning the
nature, capabilities, or other uses of the vehicle. House Report No. 111, 103rd Congress, 1st Session, p. 33. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule mirrors the language of section 13924 of the Leland Act and the accompanying legislative history.
The Department believes the proposed regulation is general enough to permit State agencies the greatest flexibility.
During the January 20, 1994 public hearing, some individuals illustrated the need for flexibility by stating that
in remote areas of Alaska, households bring in their fuel and water by boat. Under this proposed rule, the State agency
would have the flexibility to determine if the boat meets the vehicle exclusion requirement of section 13923 of the
Leland Act because the Department does not define the term ``vehicle''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not proposing any specific verification requirements for determining if the value of a vehicle
should be excluded under section 13924. However, the Department expects that State agencies will verify the need
for a vehicle to carry fuel and water for the household's use and is soliciting comments on the best means of verification.
Some State agencies may decide to add a question to their food stamp applications that asks if a household depends on
a vehicle to carry water or fuel for heating. Other State agencies may instruct its eligibility workers to ask such
a question at a household's certification interview.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department understands that there will be some instances where households are hooked up to public utilities,
such as heat and water, but are unable to use these utilities for whatever reason, such as non-payment of utility bill.
The Department believes that as long as a household is using a vehicle to carry fuel for heat or water, access to public
utilities should have no bearing on the vehicle exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.8(h)(1) to add a new paragraph (vi) to exclude as a resource
the value of a vehicle that a household depends upon to carry fuel for heating or water for home use when such transported
fuel or water is the primary source of fuel or water for the household. Households will receive this resource exclusion
without having to meet any additional tests concerning the nature, capabilities, or other uses of the vehicle. Furthermore,
the household will not be required to provide documentary evidence, as required in 7 CFR 273.2(f)(4), unless the basis
for the exclusion of the vehicle is questionable. If the basis for the exclusion of a vehicle is questionable, the State
agency must require documentation showing that the vehicle is used to carry fuel for heating or water for home use.
Also, the Department is proposing a technical amendment to 7 CFR 273.8(h)(6) to correct an oversight in the summary
of how vehicles are handled. The Department failed to list vehicles necessary to transport a physically disabled
household member as an exclusion. The Department proposes to add this exclusion in addition to the exclusion for a
vehicle used to carry fuel or water.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.8(h)(3), in accordance with section 5(g) of the Act, require that all licensed vehicles
be evaluated to determine their fair market value over $4,500. The fair market value over $4,500 is counted as a resource
for one vehicle per household and for vehicles used for work, training or education, or to seek work. For other vehicles,
the fair market value over $4,500 or the equity value, whichever is greater, is counted as a resource. 7 CFR 273.8(h)
excludes a vehicle as a resource if the vehicle is used primarily for income producing purposes; annually produces
income consistent with its fair market value; is necessary for long-distance travel that is essential to employment;
is used as a household's home; or is necessary to transport a physically disabled household member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has received numerous comments from State agencies, the general public and advocate groups about
the $4,500 fair market value resource exclusion, which has remained unchanged since the enactment of the Food Stamp
Act of 1977. The comments expressed the belief that the $4,500 fair market value resource exclusion is too low and does
not accurately reflect changes due to inflation, and thus was detrimental to food stamp households. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13923 of the Leland Act amended section 5(g)(2) of the Act to increase the fair market value resource exclusion
of vehicles in the following manner. The current $4,500 fair market value resource exclusion will remain in effect
through August 31, 1994. On September 1, 1994, the resource exclusion will increase to $4,550 and be effective through
September 30, 1995. On October 1, 1995, the resource exclusion will increase again to $4,600 and be effective through
September 30, 1996. On October 1, 1996 and on every October 1 thereafter, the fair market value resource exclusion
of vehicles shall be adjusted annually, using a base of $5,000, to reflect changes in the new car component of the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending
the preceding June 30th, rounded to the nearest $50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to implement Section 13923 of the Leland Act, the Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.8(h)(3) in accordance
with the timetable prescribed by Section 13923. The Department would provide the yearly fair market value resource
exclusion for the period beginning October 1, 1996 and thereafter to State agencies on an annual basis.

General Assistance (GA) Vendor Payments_7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(b)(2)(i) require State agencies to count payments from GA programs (as defined
in 7 CFR 271.2) as unearned income even if provided in the form of a third-party payment, unless the vendor payment is
specifically exempt under 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13915 of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act (the 1993 Leland Act), Chapter 3, Title XIII of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 674, enacted August 10, 1993), amended section
5(k)(1)(B) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (the Act), 7 U.S.C. 2014(k)(1)(B), to change the treatment of GA
vendor payments. As amended, section 5(k)(1)(B) provides that GA provided to a third party on behalf of a household
by a State or local government shall be considered money payable directly to the household if the assistance is provided
in lieu of a benefit payable to the household for housing expenses (exclusive of energy or utility-cost assistance)
under a State or local general assistance program or another basic assistance program comparable to GA (as determined
by the Secretary). Previously, assistance provided for living expenses was included as income, with specified exceptions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
House Report 103&hyph;111, p. 30 (May 25, 1993) indicates that administration of the current provision requiring
that GA assistance provided for living expenses be counted as income is complex. It also states that a recipient's
need for food stamp assistance is not materially affected by many of the vendor payments, such as a voucher for gasoline
to get to a job interview or a one-time payment to a utility company to prevent a shutoff of service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the House Report indicates that Congress wanted to reduce the number of GA vendor payments counted as
income in States that provide some GA in cash. Under section 1722 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade
Act of 1990, (Pub. L. 101&hyph;624), GA vendor payments are excluded from income pursuant to section 5(k)(1)(H) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. 2014(k)(1)(H), in States in which, by State law, no cash assistance is provided. Section 13915 of
the 1993 Leland Act would reduce the differences in treatment of GA payments from one State to another. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 Leland Act did not remove the provision of section 5(k)(2) that the requirement to count public assistance
(PA) or GA payments shall not apply to certain energy assistance, assistance provided by a State or local housing authority,
emergency assistance for migrant or seasonal farmworker households during the period such households are in the
job stream, housing assistance payments made to a third party on behalf of a household residing in transitional housing
for the homeless, or special or emergency assistance.

Therefore, we are proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1)(ii) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that housing assistance provided to a third party on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

basic assistance program comparable to GA (as defined in &sect;271.2)

following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Assistance provided for utility costs. The exclusion is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

are made under the program in cash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1)(ii) address both PA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GA vendor payments. The Food Stamp Program regulations at 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
271.2 define GA as assistance financed by State or local funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``as part of a program which provides assistance to cover living 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses or other basic needs intended to promote the health or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well-being of recipients.'' PA is defined in that section to mean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain specified programs authorized under the Social Security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1935, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AFDC) and aid to the aged, blind and disabled. The 1993 Leland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act did not make any changes in the provisions of section 5(k) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act concerning treatment of PA vendor payments. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PA and GA vendor payments must be treated differently, and we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing in this rule to separate the provisions for treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of PA and GA vendor payments. Because of the need to reorganize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) to distinguish between treatment of GA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and PA payments, we are proposing to take advantage of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to restructure 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) in its entirety. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are proposing this reorganization to make specific vendor payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusions easier to locate in the regulations. We are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing any changes in the requirements of the section except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those required by the 1993 Leland Act related to the GA vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments. We are proposing minor changes in the language of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section for clarity. We are also proposing to remove the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference in current 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1)(iii) to the experimental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing allowance programs in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and South 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bend, Indiana, because the programs are no longer in existence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed reorganization of &sect;273.9(c)(1), the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for excluding vendor payments would be divided into seven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs as follows:

Student Earned Income Exclusion_7 CFR 273.9(c)(7) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(c)(7) require State agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to exclude from household income the earned income of children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who are members of the household, students at least half-time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and under 18. The exclusion applies during temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interruptions in school attendance, provided the child's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment will resume following the break. If the child's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earnings or amount of work performed cannot be differentiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from that of other household members, the total earnings are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prorated equally among the working members and the child's pro 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rata share is excluded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current regulations, individuals are considered children if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are under the parental control of another household member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exclusion does not apply if the student has formed a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household. No distinction is made between students who live with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their parents in a separate food stamp household and students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
live separately from parents. In addition, the regulations do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not specify what type of educational institution the student must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be attending (high school, college, vocational training, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13911 of the 1993 Leland Act amended section 5(d)(7) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act, 7 U.S.C. 2014(d)(7), to exclude ``income earned by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child who is a member of the household, who is an elementary or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary school student, and who is 21 years of age or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
younger *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The legislative history (House Report 103&hyph;111, pp. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27&hyph;28) indicates that the provision is intended to assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families with high school students whose education has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delayed (for example, students who have to learn English in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classroom) and who have not been able to complete high school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before age 18. Under current rules, the income of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students would be counted in determining the eligibility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of the household and could result in a reduction in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family's benefits or ineligibility. The Report also indicates at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
p. 28 that ``[t]he Committee wishes to emphasize that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment in no way changes current law regarding those students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who live away from home and have formed a separate household.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several issues have arisen in connection with the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision that will continue to be relevant under the changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed to implement section 13911 of the 1993 Leland Act. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue has been whether a student has to be under the parental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of a household member, as currently required, for his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her income to be excluded. Parental control was the issue in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989 lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District of Maine (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dion v. Commissioner, Maine Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Social Services v. Sullivan and Yeutter.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The case involved a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high school student under 18 with a child. The student and child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lived with the student's parents but were certified as a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food stamp household. The State agency did not exclude the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's earnings from part-time work because the student was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not under parental control. The District Court decided that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parental control provision of the current regulations was invalid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the Act does not expressly contain such a limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This decision was subsequently upheld by the First Circuit Court 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Appeals, 933 F.2d 13 (1st Cir. 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory language of section 13911 does not specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrict the student income exclusion to students living with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their parents or under the parental control of another adult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a literal reading of the amended statute, the exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would apply to any high school or elementary school student under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22, even if the student was living separately from his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parents. The House Report at p. 28 indicates, however, that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion was not intended to apply to students who have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established a separate residence. Both the House Report and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dion 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decision support allowing the exclusion to students who live 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with their parents but who may have a separate food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household. This is a middle position between the extremes of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unrestricted exclusion and one limited to students under parental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, and it is the position we are proposing to adopt. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invite comments concerning the best way to implement this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision so as to limit the income exclusion to the households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress intended to help without placing an unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative burden on households and State agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this rule we are proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(c)(7) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that the earned income of elementary or high school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who are 21 years of age or younger and living with their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parents (rather than in a separate living arrangement) shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded. The exclusion would apply if the student is in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same food stamp household as a natural, adoptive or step-parent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or is under the parental control of another member of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food stamp household. The exclusion would also be allowed if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student is in a separate food stamp household but is living with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a natural, adoptive or step-parent. Parental control would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a factor if the student is in a separate food stamp household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue concerning the income of students that has come to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our attention is whether to require that students be attending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school at least half-time for the exclusion to apply. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislative history of section 13911 of the 1993 Leland Act did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not address this issue. However, because the legislation extends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exclusion to students age 21 and under, we believe it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important that the exclusion be limited only to those students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who are seriously pursuing a regular high school diploma or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Equivalency Diploma (GED). According to House Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
103&hyph;111, Congress intended this income exclusion to assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households in which a student's education has been delayed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Frequently, students who have dropped out of school for a time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decide to obtain a GED instead of a regular high school diploma. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These students may be earning sufficient income to adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the household's benefits if the earnings were counted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we are proposing that the earned income of elementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or high school students be excluded if the student is attending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school (including GED classes) at least half-time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A related issue is the point at which a student's earnings must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be counted. For example, a household applies on June 10, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student will be 21 on June 20. Or, a household is certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through December 31, and the student turns 21 on August 10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This issue was addressed in Policy Memo 84&hyph;6 dated October 24, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1983, which has since been rescinded. The Policy Memo provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that if a student turned 18 in the month of application, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caseworker should determine at the time of the interview how much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income the student received or anticipated receiving after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turning 18. That amount would be counted as income to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household, and any amount received prior to the 18th birthday 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be excluded. For participating households, the Policy Memo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that the student's earned income should not be counted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before he or she turned 18. Because it would not be feasible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine and count only the portion of a month's income that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received after the birthday for an ongoing household, the income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be counted in the month the student turned 18 only if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change occurred on the first of the month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 4, 1991 (56 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 63597), amended the regulations for retrospective budgeting to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporate the provisions of Policy Memo 84&hyph;6 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrospectively budgeted households into the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.21(j)(1)(vii)(A) provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the earned income of a student is counted only if the student is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18 years of age or older ``at the beginning of the budget month.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By way of providing an example, the preamble to the rule (56 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 63602) clarifies that in a two-month retrospective budgeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, if a student turns 18 during the month of September, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's earned income is not counted until the month of October 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becomes the budget month. That is when the student is 18 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of age at the beginning of the budget month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An objection was raised to the provision in Policy Memo 84&hyph;6 that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required State agencies to treat applicant and ongoing households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differently. For the month of application, workers were required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to count the income received by a student after he turned 18. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in an ongoing household, the income was not to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted unless the student turned 18 on the first of the month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To make the requirements for applicant and ongoing households and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective and retrospective budgeting procedures the same, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are proposing to add a new paragraph (E) to 7 CFR 273.10(e)(2)(i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide that for prospective eligibility and benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination, the earned income of a high school or elementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school student shall be counted beginning with the month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following the month in which the student turns 22. We are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.21(j)(1)(vii) to provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrospective eligibility and budgeting purposes that the income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an elementary or secondary student shall be counted beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the budget month after the month in which the student turns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. In the examples above, the earnings of the student who will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be 22 in the middle of June, the month of application, would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be included in household income until July. The earnings of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student who turns 22 in August in the middle of the certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period would not be included in household income until September. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eligibility workers would have to be alert to a change in the age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a student during the certification period. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, a student's earnings would be included in budget month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income the month following the month the student turns 22 under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both prospective and retrospective budgeting and at application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and during the certification period. Under retrospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budgeting, the effect of including a student's earnings would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be reflected in the allotment until the issuance month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corresponding to the budget month following the month in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student becomes 22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule proposes to amend 7 CFR 273.9(c)(7) to provide that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earned income of an elementary or secondary school student shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be excluded if the student is (1) 21 years of age or younger; (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
living in the same food stamp household with a natural, adoptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or step-parent, under the parental control of another member of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same food stamp household other than a parent, or in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate food stamp household but living with a natural, adoptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or step-parent; and (3) attending school (including GED classes) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least half-time. We are retaining the provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulations regarding the continuation of the exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during temporary interruptions in school attendance and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proration of income when the child's share cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differentiated. We are also proposing to amend 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.10(e)(2)(i) and 7 CFR 273.21(j)(1)(vii)(A) to provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the earnings of elementary and secondary school students shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be counted until the month following the month in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student becomes 22. For clarity, we propose to amend the phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the first sentence of 7 CFR 273.21(j)(1)(vii)(A) regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
averaged income to add a reference to 7 CFR 273.21(f), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifies the circumstances under which retrospectively budgeted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income may be averaged.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4), households are allowed to deduct from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their income their actual dependent care expenses up to a maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of $160 per month per dependent. These dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses must be necessary for a household member: (1) to accept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or continue employment, (2) to participate in the Food Stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program's Employment and Training (E&amp;T) Program or an equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort by those not subject to E&amp;T, or (3) to attend training or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive education or training which is preparatory to employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 404 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;435 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HPA), amended section 5(e) of the Act to increase the dependent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care deduction for certain households and to provide that other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households would not be entitled to the dependent care deduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HPA provided that households eligible for the dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction can deduct up to $160 a month per dependent rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$160 per household, and specified that the dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction cannot be taken for dependent care expenses which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursed under an employment and training program as specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 6(d)(4)(I) of the Act. Accordingly, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4) and 7 CFR 273.10(e)(1)(i)(E) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement HPA changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 13, 1988, the Family Support Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;485, (Family Support Act) was enacted. Section
302 of Title III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Family Support Act provides for Transitional Child Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TCC) for eligible families which have ceased to receive Aid to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Program benefits as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of increased hours or increased income from employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 301 of Title III also specifies that any money received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as payment for child care or any reimbursement for costs incurred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for child care shall not be treated as income for purposes of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other Federal or federally assisted program that bases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility or the amount of benefits upon need. In response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title III, the Department amended 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a deduction for only the portion of child care expense which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not reimbursed or not paid for by the Job Opportunities and Basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Skills Training (JOBS) program under Title IV&hyph;F of the Social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 681, et seq.) or the Transitional Child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorizing TCC are found in section 402(g)(1) of the Social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 602(g)(1).) With the enactment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 13922 of the Leland Act amended section 5(e) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by replacing the $160 a month maximum dependent care deduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a two-tier maximum dependent care deduction. For each child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the age of two, the maximum monthly dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction is $200; for all other dependents, the maximum monthly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent care deduction is $175. Implementation of the two-tier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum dependent care deduction shall take effect and shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented on September 1, 1994. In its discussion on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing the two-tier maximum dependent care deduction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress urged that implementation be conducted in ways that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize administrative burdens on State agencies. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when a child reaches his or her second birthday before the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a certification period, the State agency should not be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reduce the maximum monthly dependent care deduction from $200 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to $175 until the household's next recertification (House 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conference Report No. 213, 103rd Congress, 1st Session (1993), p. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
926). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 7 CFR 273.10(e) by replacing the $160 a month maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent care deduction with the $200 a month maximum dependent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care deduction for each child under two years of age and $175 a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month maximum dependent care deduction for each other dependent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also adding a requirement that whenever a child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaches his or her birthday during the certification period, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum dependent care deduction shall be adjusted no later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next regularly scheduled recertification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Department is proposing a conforming change to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to replace the term ``child care expense'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the term ``dependent care expense'' in order to clarify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is dependent care expenses reimbursed by the JOBS or TCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs which are not deductible for food stamp households, not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just child care expenses.

Since 1971, individuals who are not specifically exempted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act have been required to register for work at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application as a condition of eligibility for food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits. Currently, 7 CFR 273.7(a) requires that they register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at application and once every 12 months thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In April 1987, State agencies began operating the Food Stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employment and Training (E&amp;T) Program, a program aimed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically at improving food stamp recipients' ability to gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment, increase earnings and reduce their dependency on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public assistance. State agencies operate a variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment and training activities, including job search and job 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
search training, self-employment efforts, and vocational and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work registrants are the most job ready of the food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population and comprise approximately 8 percent of all food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients. Of those food stamp recipients who register for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work, about 70 percent are subject to the E&amp;T requirements.

Certain work registrants are exempted from E&amp;T participation by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies and are not required to participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Food stamp recipients may also volunteer to participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the E&amp;T program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(ii) require State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to provide payments or reimbursements to participants in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Food Stamp E&amp;T program for certain expenses that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably necessary and directly related to participation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E&amp;T program. The Federal government matches half the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies spend to reimburse participants under 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.7(d)(1)(ii)(B) for the actual costs of transportation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other costs (excluding dependent care) that are determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency to be necessary and directly related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the E&amp;T program. Therefore, the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government will pay up to $12.50 of the $25 per month. State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies may supplement this amount, but without Federal matching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies must also provide payments or reimbursements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E&amp;T participants for dependent care expenditures of up to $160 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per dependent per month. The Federal government will pay up to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$80 of the $160 per month. A reimbursement cannot be provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a dependent age 13 or older unless the dependent is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physically and/or mentally incapable of caring for himself or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
herself or is under court supervision. The Federal government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not reimburse more than the actual cost of dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses up to $80 per dependent per month, regardless of how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many household members are participating in E&amp;T. Finally, an E&amp;T 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participant is not entitled to the reimbursement for dependent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care expenditures if a member of the participant's food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household provides the dependent care services.

Changes to Dependent Care Reimbursements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13922 of the Leland Act amended section 6(d) of the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stamp Act to remove the $160 cap on dependent care reimbursements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to participants in the E&amp;T program. In place of the cap, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies must reimburse the actual costs of dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses up to a limit set by the State agency. Section 13922 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stipulates that the statewide limit set by the State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be less than the limit for the dependent care deduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 5(e) of the Act, that is, $200 per month for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent under age 2 and $175 per month for each other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent. In no event may the reimbursement exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable local market rate as determined by procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the JOBS Program. Thus, the State agency must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimburse actual costs for dependent care up to either the local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market rate or the statewide limit set by the State agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is lower. The Department will continue to match State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency expenditures for reimbursements at the 50 percent level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An example will help to explain the above provision. Assume that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State agency sets a statewide limit of $250, which is higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the dependent care deduction, on the amount of dependent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care costs it will reimburse. In City A, the local market rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is also $250. Thus, the State agency would reimburse a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participant in the E&amp;T program for actual costs up to $250. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
City B, the local market rate is $225. Even if the actual cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for dependent care is $250, the State agency will only reimburse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the participant for $225, the local market rate, as the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency cannot provide reimbursement payments which exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local market rate. In City C, the local market rate is $275. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State agency would reimburse the participant for $250, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statewide limit. In any of the scenarios above, if the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of dependent care was less than the statewide limit of $250, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State agency would only reimburse the actual cost of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hence, the State agency must pay the lowest of the actual cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent care, the local market rate, or the statewide limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State agency may supplement this amount, but without Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matching funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons determined by the State agency to have actual monthly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses that are reasonably necessary and directly related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the E&amp;T program which exceed the allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement amount (i.e., exceed the local market rate) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be considered by the State agency to have good cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for nonparticipation in an E&amp;T component.

Defining the Statewide Limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13922(b) of the Leland Act directs each State agency to establish a statewide limit on reimbursable dependent
care expenses. The statewide limit may be any amount the State agency chooses provided it is equal to or higher than
the amount of the dependent care deduction under 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4), that is, at least $200 per month for dependents
under age 2 and $175 per month for all other dependents. The statewide limit may be a single amount of at least $200 per
month or it may be two different amounts (one for dependents under age 2 and another for dependents age 2 and over). Additionally,
the State agency may establish different statewide limits for dependents with special needs and for full-time and
part-time care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statewide limit would be used only when it is lower than both the local market rate and the actual cost of care. If
the local market rate is lower than either the statewide limit or the actual cost, the statewide limit would not affect
how much the State agency must pay_it is obligated to pay the local market rate. Likewise, if the actual cost of dependent
care is lower than either the statewide limit or the local market rate, the State would pay for actual expenditures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statewide limit would apply equally to four categories of care (center care, group family care, family day care
and in-home care) in all areas of the State. Unless the State agency chooses to establish a different statewide limit
for children with special needs or physically or mentally disabled adults, the same limit would apply to these categories
of dependents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is proposing that State agencies, in revising their current E&amp;T reimbursement procedures to
include a statewide limit, adopt the limit(s) already established and in use by State IV&hyph;A agencies pursuant
to section 402(g) of the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620 (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.)) and specify the limit(s) in their
State E&amp;T Plans.

Defining the Local Market Rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13922 of the Leland Act also directs State agencies to determine local market rates using procedures consistent
with section 402(g) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 602(g). Section 402(g) programs set local market rates at
the 75th percentile of the cost of child care based on a survey of actual charges in a local area. This process is described
in 45 CFR 255.4(a) (2) and (3), in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 602(g)(3)(B)(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 402(g), local market rates are determined for the same four categories of care that apply to the statewide
limit, i.e., center care, group family care, family day care and in-home care. Local market rates must also vary according
to the age or special needs of the child. For example, rates must reflect care for infants, toddlers, preschool, and
school children. Finally, local market rates must also differentiate between full-time and part-time care, and
reflect considerations for reductions in the cost of care for additional children from the same family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is proposing that State agencies, in revising their current E&amp;T reimbursement procedures, adopt
the local market rates for child care already established and in use by State IV&hyph;A agencies. This would alleviate
the need for the State agencies to conduct separate surveys and determinations as described above. State agencies
would be required to specify local market rates in their E&amp;T State Plans. However, a description of the methodology
used to establish the local market rates would not be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food Stamp E&amp;T reimbursements may be used to pay the cost of care for a broader range of dependents than allowed
under section 402(g) programs. Section 402(g) programs provide child care for AFDC-eligible dependents who are:
Under age 13; physically or mentally incapable of caring for themselves; or under court supervision, to the extent
that such child care is necessary to permit AFDC-eligible family members to work or attend educational or training
programs. AFDC child care is generally limited to dependents under age 18, due to AFDC eligibility criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(ii), dependent care reimbursements must be provided under the E&amp;T program
for dependents who are: Age 13 or younger; physically and/or mentally incapable of caring for themselves; or under
court supervision, regardless of the age of the dependent. Therefore, State agencies would be required to establish
separate local market rates that address the cost of care for dependents over age 18 (or no longer AFDC-eligible) who
are physically and/or mentally incapable of caring for themselves or under court supervision, as this type of care
is not addressed under section 402(g). State agencies would not be required to follow the procedures under section
402(g) for determining local market rates for this type of care. The separate local market rates established by the
State agency would be included in the E&amp;T State Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifty percent Federal funding will be available to State agencies for the actual cost of dependent care up to the local
market rate or the statewide limit established by the State agency. State agencies would not pay an amount lower than
the lowest of the actual cost of care, the statewide limit, or the local market rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is proposing that two paragraphs be added to 7 CFR 273.7(c)(4) of the current regulations. They would
require that State agencies include the dependent care statewide limit(s) and the local market rates to be used in
determining dependent care reimbursement amounts in their State E&amp;T Plans.

care reimbursements. Instead, State agencies would reimburse participants in the E&amp;T program for dependent
care expenses up to the actual cost of dependent care, the local market rate, or the statewide limit, whichever is lowest.

Proration of Benefits_7 CFR 273.10(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.10(a)(2) require that if an application for recertification is submitted after
a household's certification period has expired, the application shall be considered an initial application and
the household's benefits for the first month shall be prorated in accordance with 7 CFR 273.10(a)(1)(ii). Section
13916 of the 1993 Leland Act amended Section 8(c)(2)(B) of the Food Stamp Act, 7 U.S.C. 2017(c)(2)(B), to eliminate
proration of first month's benefits if a household is recertified for food stamps after a break in participation of
less than one month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.10(a)(1)(ii) require that a household's benefit level for the initial month of certification
be based on the day of the month it applies for benefits and that the household receive benefits from the date of application
to the end of the month. Prior to the enactment of the 1993 Leland Act, ``initial month of certification'' referred
to the first month for which an allotment is issued to a household following any period in which such household was not
participating in the Food Stamp Program. Section 13916 of the 1993 Leland Act, however, revised the definition of
``initial month'' to now mean the first month for which an allotment is issued to a household following any period of
more than one month in which such household was not participating in the Food Stamp Program. Therefore, if a household
reapplies for benefits after a break in participation of less than one month, that month of application is not considered
an initial month, and the household's benefits for that month cannot be prorated. Current regulations already prohibit
the proration of first month's benefits for migrant and seasonal farmworker households that apply for benefits within
30 days following the end of their last certification period. The Department is proposing to revise 7 CFR 273.10(a)(1)(ii)
and (2)(i) to prohibit the proration of first month's benefits for all households that apply for benefits after a break
in participation of less than one month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also proposing to remove from the regulations paragraphs (a)(2) (ii) and (iii) of 7 CFR 273.10. Both
provisions, which prohibit proration in the first month of a household's new certification period, have been made
moot by Section 13916 of the 1993 Leland Act.

Section 13971 of the Leland Act requires implementation of the provisions contained in this proposed rule on September
1, 1994. Therefore, we are proposing that the amendments made by this rule be effective and implemented on September
1, 1994. State agencies would be required to adjust the cases of ongoing households at the next recertification, at
household request, or when the case is next reviewed, whichever comes first, and provide restored benefits back to
the required implementation date. If for any reason a State agency fails to implement on the required date, restored
benefits shall be provided, if appropriate, back to the required implementation date or the date of application,
whichever is later. Variances resulting from implementation of the provisions of the final rule would be excluded
from error analysis for 120 days from the required implementation date, in accordance with section 13951 of the Leland
Act.

of the vehicle is questionable. If the basis for exclusion of

documentation from the household, in accordance with

(3) Each licensed vehicle not excluded under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h)(1) of this section shall be evaluated individually to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine its fair market value resource exclusion limit, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that portion of the resource exclusion limit which exceeds $4,500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for FY 1993, shall be attributed in full toward the household's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource level regardless of any encumbrances. The $4,500 fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market value resource exclusion limit for licensed vehicles shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in effect through August 31, 1994. On September 1, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through September 30, 1995, the fair market value resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion limit shall be increased to $4,550. On October 1, 1995 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through September 30, 1996, the fair market value resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion limit shall be increased to $4,600. On October 1, 1996 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and each October 1 thereafter, using a base of $5,000, the fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market value resource exclusion limit for licensed vehicles shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be adjusted to reflect changes in the new car component of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending on June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 preceding the date of such adjustment and rounded to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearest $50. Any value in excess of the appropriate fair market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value resource exclusion limit shall be attributed in full toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household's resource level, regardless of any encumbrances on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vehicle. For example, in November 1994 a household owning an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automobile with a fair market value of $5,550 shall have $1,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied toward its resource exclusion level. Any value in excess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of $4,550 (the fair market value resource exclusion limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that time period) shall be attributed to the household's resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level, regardless of the amount of the household's investment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vehicle, and regardless of whether or not the vehicle is used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to transport household members to and from employment. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle shall be appraised individually. The fair market value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource exclusion limit of two or more vehicles shall not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added together to reach a total fair market value resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion in excess of the fair market value resource exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the appropriate time period.

follows: First, the vehicle shall be evaluated to determine if it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is an income producer, a home, necessary to transport a disabled

household member, or necessary to carry fuel for heating or water

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their place the words ``$200 a month for each dependent child

directly to the household, including in-kind benefits and certain

vendor payments. In-kind benefits are those for which no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monetary payment is made on behalf of the household and include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meals, clothing, housing, or produce from a garden. A vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is a money payment made on behalf of a household by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person or organization outside of the household directly to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the household's creditors or to a person or organization

PA vendor payments

are counted as income unless they are made for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) medical assistance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) child care assistance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) energy assistance as defined in paragraph (c)(11) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) emergency assistance (including, but not limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing and transportation payments) for migrant or seasonal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
farmworker households while they are in the job stream; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) housing assistance payments for households living in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transitional housing for the homeless; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) emergency and special assistance. PA provided to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third party on behalf of a household which is not specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded from consideration as income under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) through (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be considered for exclusion under this provision. To be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered emergency or special assistance and excluded under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this provision, the assistance must be provided over and above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the normal PA grant or payment, or cannot normally be provided as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of such grant or payment. If the PA program is composed of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various standards or components, the assistance would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered over and above the normal grant or not part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant if the assistance is not included as a regular component of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the PA grant or benefit or the amount of assistance exceeds the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum rate of payment for the relevant component. If the PA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program is not composed of various standards or components but is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to provide a basic monthly grant or payment for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible households and provides a larger basic grant amount for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all households in a particular category, e.g., all households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with infants, the larger amount is still part of the normal grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or benefit for such households and not an ``extra'' payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded under this provision. On the other hand, if a fire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroyed a household item and a PA program provides an emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount paid directly to a store to purchase a replacement, such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is excluded under this provision. If the PA program is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not composed of various standards, allowances, or components but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is simply designed to provide assistance on an as-needed basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than to provide routine, regular monthly benefits to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
client, no exclusion would be granted under this provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the assistance is not provided over and above the normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant, it is the normal grant. If it is not clear whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain type of PA vendor payment is covered under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision, the State agency shall apply to the appropriate FNS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Office for a determination of whether the PA vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments should be excluded. The application for this exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination must explain the emergency or special nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor payment, the exact type of assistance it is intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide, who is eligible for the assistance, how the assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is paid, and how the vendor payment fits into the overall PA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit standard. A copy of the rules, ordinances, or statutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which create and authorize the program shall accompany the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General assistance (GA) vendor payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vendor payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made under a State or local GA program or a comparable basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance program are excluded from income except for some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor payments for housing. A housing vendor payment is counted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as income unless the payment is for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) assistance provided for utility costs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) energy assistance (as defined in paragraph (c)(11) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1)(i)(F) of this section; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) assistance provided under a program in a State in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no GA payments may be made directly to the household in the form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of cash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Rent or mortgage payments made to landlords or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mortgagees by HUD are excluded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Educational assistance vendor payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance provided to a third party on behalf of the household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for living expenses shall be treated the same as educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance payable directly to the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vendor payments that are reimbursements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reimbursements made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the form of vendor payments are excluded on the same basis as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursements paid directly to the household in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(5) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Demonstration project vendor payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In-kind or vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments which would normally be excluded as income but are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
converted in whole or in part to a direct cash payment under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally authorized demonstration project or waiver of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of Federal law shall be excluded from income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other third-party payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other third-party payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be handled as follows: Moneys legally obligated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise payable to the household which are diverted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider of the payment to a third party for a household expense 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be counted as income and not excluded. If a person or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organization makes a payment to a third party on behalf of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household using funds that are not owed to the household, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment shall be excluded from income. This distinction is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illustrated by the following examples: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A friend or relative uses his or her own money to pay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household's rent directly to the landlord. This vendor payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be excluded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A household member earns wages. However, the wages are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garnished or diverted by the employer and paid to a third party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a household expense, such as rent. This vendor payment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted as income. However, if the employer pays a household's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rent directly to the landlord 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in addition to paying the household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its regular wages, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the rent payment shall be excluded from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income. Similarly, if the employer provides housing to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee in addition to wages, the value of the housing shall not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be counted as income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A household receives court-ordered monthly support payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the amount of $400. Later, $200 is diverted by the provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and paid directly to a creditor for a household expense. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is counted as income. Money deducted or diverted from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
court-ordered support or alimony payment (or other binding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written support or alimony agreement) to a third party for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household's expense shall be included as income because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is taken from money that is owed to the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, payments specified by a court order or other legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
binding agreement to go directly to a third party rather than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household are excluded from income because they are not otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable to the household. For example, a court awards support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments in the amount of $400 a month and in addition orders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$200 to be paid directly to a bank for repayment of a loan. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$400 payment is counted as income and the $200 payment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded from income. Support payments not required by a court 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order or other legally binding agreement (including payments in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess of the amount specified in a court order or written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement) which are paid to a third party on the household's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf shall be excluded from income.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) adopted two recommendations and one formal statement
at its Fiftieth Plenary Session. The recommendations concern the use of audited self-regulation as a regulatory
technique and procedures for civil forfeiture of property or other assets. The statement presents the views of the
Conference on the Social Security Administration's proposal to reengineer the disability benefits process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Administrative Conference of the United States was established by the Administrative Conference Act, 5 U.S.C.
591&hyph;596. The Conference studies the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness of the administrative procedures
used by federal agencies in carrying out administrative programs, and makes recommendations for improvements to
the agencies, collectively or individually, and to the President, Congress, and the Judicial Conference of the United
States (5 U.S.C. 594(1)). At its Fiftieth Plenary Session, held June 16, 1994, the Assembly of the Administrative
Conference of the United States adopted two recommendations and a formal statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recommendation 94&hyph;1, The Use of Audited Self-Regulation as a Regulatory Technique, suggests that when certain
prerequisites and safeguards are present, Congress and federal agencies should consider the possibility of delegating
regulatory power to a private self-regulatory organization. The recommendation emphasizes the necessity of ensuring
the effectiveness and the fairness of the process, and identifies standards for determining whether such a delegation
may be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recommendation 94&hyph;2, Reforming the Government's Procedure for Civil Forfeiture, suggests improvements
in this process. The United States Government has in recent years made increasing use of its power to confiscate the
property or assets of persons involved in illegal activities through civil forfeitures. Notice of an impending administrative
forfeiture is sent to the last known address of the owner and is published in newspapers. This system has been criticized
as unduly expensive and ineffective. The recommendation suggests that the establishment of a centrally maintained
Civil Forfeiture Registry, which would be published and made widely available, would not only provide better and
more reliable notice, it would provide a better overview of the entire forfeiture process, thus improving public
and congressional oversight. The recommendation also proposes that Congress impose a statutory 60-day time limit
on the agency to provide notice in the Civil Forfeiture Registry and to send written notice of a seizure to the last known
address of the owner or interest holder in the property.

Statement No. 17, Comments on the Social Security Administration's Proposal on Reengineering the SSA Disability

on SSA's proposal. The Conference generally supported the proposed changes to SSA's procedures, which would reduce
the number of administrative stages from four to two, while offering claimants increased opportunity for face-to-face

The following recommendations were adopted by the Assembly of the Administrative Conference on June 16, 1994:

Recommendation 94&hyph;1, The Use of Audited Self-Regulation as a Regulatory Technique
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Audited self-regulation is defined as congressional or agency delegation of power to a private self-regulatory
organization to implement and enforce laws or agency regulations with respect to the regulated entities, with powers
of independent action and review retained by the agency. This self-regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organization is often an association of regulated entities formed for the explicit purpose of self-regulation.
Audited self-regulation is an alternative for Congress to consider in legislating any regulatory program. Properly
implemented and monitored, a program of audited self-regulation may effectively advance the statutory objectives
consistent with the public interest and the interests of the regulated entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In certain circumstances, this approach may result in better regulation because the agency's statute and rules are
supplemented and enforced by those entities directly involved in the regulated activity, which may have more detailed
knowledge of the operational or technical aspects of that activity. The regulatory program also may be more effective
because it can be tailored to the individual industry or group. In addition, the agency's regulatory enforcement
costs may be reduced by this approach, although such cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions should be considered only if they can be achieved without eroding the effectiveness of enforcement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the other hand, audited self-regulation may present the significant risks of uneven enforcement, capture of the
regulators by the regulated industry, and creating barriers to entry or competition. Where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for institutional self-interest is too great, self-regulation is undesirable. Other risks can be lessened
by requiring the self-regulatory organization to establish and follow procedures similar to those that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be applicable if the self-regulatory organization were an agency.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 For these procedures to work, effective interest groups must exist, and must have access to the agency, to raise concerns
about the conduct of the self-regulatory organization. And of course, the agency itself must vigilantly oversee
the activities of the self-regulatory organization and of the regulated entities themselves.

Such procedures generally provide for public participation and require all points of view to be taken into account
and addressed. For example, rulemaking ordinarily should provide notice and opportunity for comment to all affected
parties, and adjudications should be open to the public and include notice and hearing safeguards.

A survey of agency experience with audited self-regulation
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 reveals several common elements typically present in effective programs: (1) Industry members are organized, expert,
and motivated to comply; (2) the regulatory program requires individualized application of clear rules which can
be objectively applied; and (3) the agency itself has sufficient expertise to audit the self-regulatory activity
effectively. The survey also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revealed that audited self-regulation programs that were terminated or not implemented lacked at least one of these
elements.

Recommendation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Congress and agencies should consider audited self-regulation as a regulatory technique when designing, revising,
or reevaluating regulatory programs, but only where it can be effective, as specified in Paragraph 2 below, and only
where it can operate fairly, as specified in Paragraph 3 below. Audited self-regulation is defined as congressional
or agency delegation of power to a private self-regulatory organization to implement and enforce laws or agency regulations
with respect to the regulated entities, with powers of independent action and review retained by the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effectiveness.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Audited self-regulation can be effective if it meets the following requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The substantive standards, whether imposed by statute, regulation, or otherwise, are clearly stated and are capable
of objective application, even if judgments must be made in applying them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. A self-regulatory organization with the ability and incentive to implement these substantive standards in cooperation
with the agency exists or can be created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The organization must have the expertise, experience, authority, and commitment to design, implement, and evaluate
effective compliance measures. It must also, by itself or in combination with other self-regulatory organizations,
have jurisdiction over all regulated entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Incentive. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The organization must be motivated to undertake effective and fair self-regulation consistent with the public interest,
as that interest has been articulated by Congress and the agency. This motivation can be provided by, among other things:
(A) the members' common incentives; (B) effective monitoring by groups that may be harmed by noncompliance; (C) potential
legal liability of the self-regulated entities or the self-regulatory organization; or (D) the potential for direct
government regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The agency responsible for implementation and oversight must have the ability and incentive to implement the substantive
standards through a self-regulatory program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency must have (A) statutory authority, including at least the powers specified in Paragraph 2(d) below; (B)
sufficient substantive expertise; (C) knowledge of organizational behavior and internal control procedures of
the self-regulatory organization and its members; and (D) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient resources, including effective auditing capability to monitor compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Incentive. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency must have the incentive to implement the self-regulatory program effectively. Effective implementation
requires that the agency be committed to achieving the objectives of the statutory scheme through the self-regulatory
program. It also requires that the agency consider the rights and needs of the intended beneficiaries of the regulatory
program, who may be harmed by noncompliance, as well as the rights and needs of the regulated entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The self-regulatory program is expressly authorized by legislation that includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. an explicit statement of the scope of permitted delegation to the self-regulatory organization; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. authority for the agency (A) independently to enforce the law, agency regulations, and rules of the self-regulatory
organization relevant to the program; (B) to enforce the organic requirements of the self-regulatory organization
against the organization, and require that the organization in turn enforce its own rules against its members; (C)
to review all rules and enforcement actions of the self-regulatory organization relevant to the program; and (D)
to amend, repeal or supplement the rules of the self-regulatory organization or require the self-regulatory organization
to do so; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. a requirement that the agency, in promulgating its own rules or reviewing the rules of the self-regulatory organization,
examine the effects of those rules on competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fairness.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Audited self-regulation can operate fairly only if the procedures of the self-regulatory organization ensure that
the decisionmaker is properly informed and unbiased. Procedures for adjudication and for establishing rules of
general applicability should conform generally to those that would be followed if the proceeding were conducted
by the agency. In addition to the agency's plenary review authority referred to in Paragraph 2(d)(ii)(C), the agency
should provide parties with a right of appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Access to records and proceedings of the self-regulatory organization.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Congress and the agency should provide public access to records of the self-regulatory organization relating to
the organization's regulatory activities, to the extent such records would be available under the Freedom of Information
Act if the self-regulatory organization were an agency. Congress and the agency also should consider whether to require
any nonadjudicatory proceeding of the organization to be open to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative dispute resolution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rules of the self-regulatory organization should provide for use of informal and consensual procedures to resolve
disputes where appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrative Conference has repeatedly encouraged agencies to use alternative dispute resolution and negotiated
rulemaking techniques in appropriate circumstances. The same factors supporting those recommendations suggest
the value of informal and consensual processes in the context of self-regulatory organizations. See, e.g., Recommendations
82&hyph;4 and 86&hyph;3.

Recommendation 94&hyph;2, Reforming the Government's Procedure for Civil Forfeiture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Government has in recent years made increasing use of its power to confiscate the property or assets
of persons involved in illegal activities through the civil forfeiture process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The law classifies forfeitures as criminal or civil according to the procedure by which the government perfects its
title in the confiscated property. Criminal forfeiture follows as a consequence of criminal 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
conviction 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of the property owner. The government cannot obtain clear title until a post-trial proceeding is held. Civil forfeiture
is accomplished by civil proceedings, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in rem, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
against the property itself. Civil forfeiture has numerous advantages over criminal forfeiture in that the property
itself is the ``defendant'' in the suit, and the property may be forfeited even if the owner is dead or has fled the United
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Over a hundred statutes authorize civil forfeiture, with most involving drug, racketeering, money laundering,
or immigration violation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A civil forfeiture begins with a ``seizure'' of a privately-owned property by the investigative/prosecutorial
government agency. Constitutionally, the agency must meet the probable cause test showing that there are reasonable
grounds for belief that the property has been used in the commission, or constitutes proceeds, of the crime. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Civil forfeiture proceedings are of two types. Congress has provided for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
administrative
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 forfeiture in cases where the property is cash, the value of the property is under $500,000 or is a boat, plane or car
used to carry or store drugs, or if the seizure goes uncontested. Notice of an impending administrative forfeiture
is sent to the last known address of the owner and is published in newspapers.

A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Judicial
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 forfeiture proceeding is required when a claimant contests the seizure, when the property seized is real estate,
and when the value of the seized property (other than cash) is over $500,000. If the case proceeds, it does so in federal
district court where there is a right to a jury trial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This recommendation addresses a few procedural issues regarding civil forfeiture.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Many other issues, both procedural and substantive, have been raised by courts and by critics of the forfeiture process.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 There is a fundamental issue about the fairness and effectiveness of the entire administrative civil seizure/forfeiture
process. It currently involves an extremely informal administrative process and, for the small proportion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of judicial forfeiture cases that are taken that far, a trial in the federal district court.

This recommendation only applies to seizures by agencies acting under the authority of statutory administrative
forfeiture provisions. It does not apply to agency seizures of property under the authority of regulatory statutes
that do not have administrative forfeiture provisions, or to seizures of property that by its nature is violative

Federal adoption of state forfeiture actions is one issue which has received recent scrutiny. Under the Comprehensive
Crime Control Act of 1984, forfeited assets (property, or money derived from its sale) are allocated exclusively
for law enforcement purposes rather than to the general Treasury. Additionally, the Department of Justice and the
Customs Bureau gained authority to transfer forfeited property and cash to state and local agencies that directly
participate in law enforcement efforts leading to seizures and forfeitures. This has led some officials in six states
which require forfeited property to revert to the general state treasury, to ask federal officials to adopt state
cases and convert them into federal forfeitures. The Department of Justice asset sharing program shared over $736
million in cash and $90 million in property with state and local agencies from the state of the program in fiscal year
1986 through fiscal year 1991. In

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is good reason to be concerned that fines, uniquely of all punishments, will be imposed in a measure out of accord
with the penal goals of retribution and deterrence. Imprisonment, corporal punishment and even capital punishment
cost a State money; fines are a source of revenue. As we have recognized in the context of other constitutional provisions,
it makes sense to scrutinize governmental action more closely when the State stands to benefit.

After forfeiture, an owner may petition for remission (return) or mitigation (partial return) of the property. Of
course, in many instances, especially those involving cash, no one claims ownership. According to federal common
law, the authority to grant remission or mitigation is totally at the discretion of the seizing agency. A decision
on the merits for remission or mitigation is non-reviewable by the judiciary.

 and ineffective. The

Time Limits. At present, federal statutes provide no time limit on the agency to provide notice to the owner of the seized
property. Unlike the requirements imposed on a person contesting the seizure to file a claim to the property, deadlines
have not been similarly imposed on the agency within which it must commence a forfeiture action in district court.
Current Department of Justice policy is to send a notice of seizure to each person known to have an ownership or possessory
interest in the seized article within 60 days of the seizure. The notice triggers the running of the time specified
by the enabling statute (usually 30 days) within which a person may file a claim to the property (thus converting an
administrative forfeiture into a judicial one). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress should provide a statutory 60-day time limit on the agency to provide notice in the Civil Forfeiture Registry
and to send written notice of a seizure to the last known address of the owner or interest holder in the property. Granting
extensions or waivers of the 60-day notice requirement should be within the discretion of a federal judge or magistrate,
upon a showing by the government of good cause. Failure to meet the filing time limit (absent a waiver or extension)
should result in a return of the property pending further forfeiture proceeding.

Recommendation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Congress should provide for the establishment of a Civil Forfeiture Registry, centrally maintained, kept current,
and made widely available by the Department of Justice, in lieu of the current requirements to publish notices in specific
locations or specific media. The Department of Justice should then maintain the Civil Forfeiture Registry to provide
a well-known and continuing place for notifying owners of seized property about proposed forfeitures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Congress should modify the forfeiture laws to require the government to publish notice in the Civil Forfeiture
Registry and mail specific notice to the last known address of each person known to have an ownership or possessory
interest in the seized article within 60-days following seizure, recognizing that extensions or waivers are available
with appropriate safeguards against abuse. If the seizing agency fails to provide notice in the Civil Forfeiture
Registry (absent good cause) or to the last known address of the party from whom the property was seized within the time
limits, and no waiver or extension was granted, the seized article should be returned to the party pending further
forfeiture proceedings.

In April 1994, the Disability Process Reengineering Team of the U.S. Social Security Administration issued a proposal
on Disability Process Redesign (Redesign Proposal or Proposal). The SSA has asked for comments on this Proposal.
This Statement constitutes the official comments of the Administrative Conference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the Conference supports most of the procedural changes that the Reengineering Team has proposed. Many
of these changes have been recommended by the Conference as part of its past recommendations. In this Statement, the
Conference presents its views concerning the Disability Process Redesign Proposal in light of these recommendations.
This Statement does not address those aspects of the Proposal that relate to disability decision methodology.

The sections of the proposal that address disability decision methodology relate to the structure for making the
substantive decision whether a particular claimant meets the criteria for disability benefits. See Disability

A. The Redesign Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Reengineering Team has made a series of significant proposals to change the way that disability claims are decided.
The Proposal eliminates two of the current four administrative stages of the process, and assigns responsibility
for developing the record to a claim manager at the initial stage and to an ``adjudication officer'' at the appeal stage.
It retains the use of an administrative law judge for the appeal stage.

B. Past Administrative Conference Recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrative Conference has undertaken a series of studies over the last 15 years that address aspects of the
procedures relating to the processing of claims for disability benefits under the Social Security Act. This series
of recommendations has centered at least once on each of the many steps in the process as it currently exists. The focus
of many of these recommendations has been to improve the quality of decisionmaking by making sure that as much of the
necessary information is in the record as early in the process as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1978, the Conference issued Recommendation 78&hyph;2, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures for Determining Social Security Disability Claims
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 which primarily addressed the administrative appeal stage of Social Security disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit adjudications. It recommended the continued use of ALJs, and made suggestions concerning the development
of the evidentiary hearing record, including recommendations that ALJs take more care in questioning claimants,
seek to collect as much evidence prior to the hearing as possible, make greater use of prehearing interviews, and make
better use of treating physicians as sources of information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 addressed the organization and function of the Appeals Council. Recommendation 87&hyph;6 was based on early results
from demonstration projects involving the state-level disability determination process. It recommended additional
experimentation with face-to-face procedures. Recommendation 87&hyph;7 suggested wide-ranging and substantial
changes in the working of the Appeals Council, including that it move away from its historical function as a case review
panel. The recommendation suggested that the caseload be significantly limited, and that the Appeals Council focus
on important issues on which it could issue precedential opinions.

 addressed a variety of issues involving medical decisionmaking in disability claim determinations. It proposed
enhancement of the role of medical decisionmakers, increased effort to develop medical evidence in the record, and
improved training of the medical staff on legal and program issues. It recommended use of optional face-to-face interviews
and elimination of the reconsideration step. It also recommended that claimants be informed of deficiencies in the
medical evidence prior to the issuance of an initial determination, and that the opinion of a claimant's treating
physician be given the weight required by court decisions and SSA rules. Recommendation 89&hyph;8, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Agency Practices and Procedures for the Indexing and Public Availability of Adjudicatory Decisions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

would apply to the SSA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Initial Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Role of Disability Claim Manager 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would assign full responsibility for claim development and initial decisionmaking to a disability
claim manager. It also stresses the need to develop the record for decision as completely as possible at this stage.
The Conference has consistently encouraged the development of as complete a record as possible, as early in the process
as possible. Assigning that responsibility to a single well-trained person is consistent with the Conference's
recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Conference suggests that claim development practices be undertaken consistent with Conference Recommendation
89&hyph;10, which emphasizes the importance of full and complete factual development of disability claims, in particular
the medical aspects of such claims. Recommendation 89&hyph;10 also supports the current team approach to disability
decisionmaking, and suggests an enhanced role for medical personnel in both claim development and disability determination.
As discussed in more detail below, the Redesign Proposal retains a role for medical personnel as consultants to claim
managers. The Conference recommends that claim managers be directed to consult with medical sources regularly on
medical matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposal would allow third parties to help develop the information necessary to decide a claim. This concept is
a reasonable one, so long as the claim manager retains ultimate responsibility for developing an adequate record
and for making the decision on benefits based on the record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Role of Medical Personnel as Consultants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Redesign Proposal suggests that claim managers may use medical consultants for advice on medical issues. The
Conference, in Recommendation 89&hyph;10, suggested that the evaluation of medical evidence and decisions on medical
issues should be made by a medical professional (physician or psychologist), who should also have responsibility
for developing such evidence in the record. This recommendation was based on the two-member team approach currently
in use at the state Disability Determination Service level. The Conference continues to believe that medically-trained
personnel should have an important role in the decisionmaking process on medical evidence. Although the Proposal
does state that disability claim managers will call on the services of medical consultants, it contemplates that
the final decision on all matters, including the resolution of disputed medical issues, would rest with the claim
manager. The Conference continues to stress the need to ensure that adequate consultation with medical experts takes
place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appropriate guidelines for such consultation should be developed.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 The Conference also recommends the establishment of guidelines that set priorities for the use by claim managers
of treating physicians, examining physicians, and nonexamining physicians, including specialists.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Conference supports the aspects of the Proposal designed to improve the quality of evidence provided by medical
sources for disability adjudications. Many of these improvements and proposals track suggestions included in Recommendation
89&hyph;10. For example, the Conference has recommended that physicians be adequately compensated for their work,
and that all contacts be documented routinely in writing and included in the record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Predenial Notice With Opportunity for Face-to-Face Interview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Conference supports instituting the opportunity for a face-to-face interview between the claim manager and
the claimant at the initial stage.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 Such an opportunity will not only provide the claim manager with relevant information and the chance to ask for and
get information efficiently, but it should also give claimants more confidence in the fairness of the process, by
giving them an opportunity to be heard. This may have the effect of reducing appeals, even when benefits are denied,
because the process will be seen to have increased legitimacy.

</FOOTNOTE>

The Conference also supports the Redesign Proposal's concept of a predenial notice. The Conference has long supported
the idea that claimants should be made aware of the deficiencies in their applications, and provided the opportunity
to correct them.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 Such steps are likely to lead to more accurate early decisionmaking.

4. Issuance of Full ``Statement of the Claim'' Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Conference supports the issuance of full decisions on disability benefit claims. The proposed contents for ``Statement
of the Claim'' decisions are consistent with those the Conference recommended in Recommendation 90&hyph;4. Providing
sufficient information to claimants helps them make informed decisions about future action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Elimination of the Reconsideration Step 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Conference has also previously recommended that the reconsideration stage be eliminated if the claimant has
an opportunity for face-to-face contact with the decisionmaker at the initial stage.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 The Reengineering Team's proposal to provide such opportunity and to eliminate the redundancy of reconsideration
is an important and positive step.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Conference has long supported the concept of developing the record for an appeal as early in the process as possible.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, the approach of designating someone to prepare the claim for appeal is one the Conference supports. The Conference
also supports the idea that claims be granted based on evidence in the record without a hearing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Conference supports the use of prehearing conferences and stipulations, which could streamline the hearing
process by narrowing issues and ensuring that the necessary evidence will be available at the hearing. In some cases,
a prehearing conference may obviate the need for a hearing. It is our understanding, based on discussions with the
Redesign Team, that the Proposal would limit prehearing conferences to cases where claimants are represented. This
is consistent with Conference recommendations.

The Conference believes that improved case development will result from the special responsibilities given to disability
claim managers at the initial decisionmaking level and to prehearing officers at the administrative hearing level.
At the same time, the Conference supports retaining authority for administrative law judges to consult with medical
sources, as needed. The Conference believes that, in doing so, ALJs should follow practices similar to those set out
in Recommendation 89&hyph;10.

effectiveness of ALJ decisionmaking. The Conference's recommendations, however, have been predicated on the presumption
that an ALJ would have the ultimate decisionmaking responsibility. Although others may be available to assist, the
ALJ must retain the responsibility for the content and quality of his or her decisions.

5. Role of the Appeals Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Conference has previously recommended that the Appeals Council role in the disability process be limited.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 The Conference believes that, in reviewing cases, the Council should focus on cases raising precedential questions.
The Conference supports the Proposal's idea of having the Appeals Council also review cases on a random basis, looking
at both grants and denials. The Conference also believes that the Appeals Council should have a role in providing guidance
to decisionmakers at all stages in the claims process, through the use of precedent and interpretive guidelines concerning
adjudicatory principles and decisional standards.

2. Representatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Conference has recommended that claimants be provided information about sources of representation, both attorneys
and nonattorneys.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 It also has suggested that appropriate standards be adopted concerning proper practice, and that nonattorney representatives
be encouraged.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 The Redesign Proposal contains similar types of suggestions.

3. Precedent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposal calls for a single presentation of all substantive policies used for determination of eligibility for
benefits. This is consistent with a number of Conference recommendations that SSA make more use of agency guidance
in disability benefits cases.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 The Conference also recommends use of precedent and clear agency statements of policy to encourage uniform outcomes
among similar cases. The Appeals Council could undertake, as one of its functions, the review of ALJ determinations
for use as precedent.

4. Reopening the Record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposal implies that the record will be closed at the ALJ level. We support the idea that the record should close
following the ALJ hearing, at a time set by the ALJ, and suggest that this be made explicit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposal is silent on the availability of any opportunity to reopen the record following the ALJ hearing. While
the Conference does not generally encourage such reopenings, SSA should consider offering a limited opportunity
to reopen the record in appropriate cases, consistent with Recommendation 90&hyph;4(4), (5).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340, ``Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering
Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests,'' require a person to obtain a permit before
introducing (importing, moving interstate, or releasing into the environment) into the United States certain genetically
engineered organisms and products that are considered ``regulated articles.'' The regulations set forth procedures
for obtaining a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article, and for obtaining a limited permit
for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 22, 1991, a notice of intent to prepare a revised draft supplement to the final environmental impact statement
(EIS) for the Early Winters Alpine Winter Sports Study on the Okanogan National Forest was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 2158). Because there is no longer any party proposing development of this alpine winter sport site and, subsequently,
no need for a land exchange in the project area, the Forest Service has decided to cancel this revised supplemental
EIS. The data developed and collected from the environmental and the land exchange analyses, as directed by Public
Law 101&hyph;560, is completed and will be made a part of the public record.

The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicated that the project will not cause significant
local, regional, or national adverse impacts to the environment. As a result of these findings, Lynn A. Brown, State
Conservationist, has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement is not needed
for this project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project purpose is to improve the water quality of the Yakima River. The major practice proposed is the conversion
of surface irrigation to drip irrigation on approximately 5,000 acres. This practice will virtually eliminate tailwater
from these fields therefore eliminating irrigation induced erosion which has contributed to poor water quality
in the Yakima River.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other proposed conservation practices include: irrigation water management, nutrient management, and pesticide
management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The North Yakima Conservation District will be sponsors of the proposed project. They will encourage development
and installation of conservation plans on all eligible land within the watershed. They will provide leadership through
an aggressive information and education program to encourage the application of land treatment measures necessary
for the success of this plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Notice of a Finding Of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency
and to various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are
available to fill single copy requests at the above address. Basic data developed during the environmental assessment
are on file and may be reviewed by contacting Frank R. Easter, Assistant State Conservationist (Programs).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No administrative action on implementation of the proposal will be taken until 30 days after the date of this publication

The purpose of this notice is to provide advance information concerning a test of a new code of service to move international
household goods (HHG) shipments under the MTMC international through Government Bill of Lading Program (ITGBL).
MTMC is proposing to test a new code of service, (Code 3), for ITGBL HHG shipments moving between CONUS and Korea, Japan,
and Okinawa, effective with the international summer (IS95) cycle, 1 April 1995. Carrier single factor rate (SFR)
submissions for Code 3 service will include all charges and the performance services currently in the Code 4 rate except
ocean freight charges. The Military Sealift Command (MSC) over-ocean routing rates will be used for the ocean segment.
The terms, conditions, and rules, contained in the International Personal Property Rate Solicitation will apply.
Certain provisions will be added to the MTMC ITGBL rate solicitation to authorize use of the MSC ocean rates by approved
freight forwarders and will provide conditions for forwarder participation. The IS95 solicitation is scheduled
to be distributed to industry in mid October, to be effective 1 April 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
MTMC proposes testing a new code of service (Code 3) for international containerized HHG shipments moving between
CONUS and Korea, Japan, and Okinawa. Department of Defense-approved ITGBL carriers having Code 4 approval to transport
HHG shipments to/from Korea, Japan, and Okinawa, will be automatically, unless otherwise requested, approved to
participate in the test. ITGBL carrier participation and/or rate submission, is optional. The transportation SFR
for Code 3 shipments will include all services in Item 432 of the International Personal Property Rate Solicitation
except over-ocean transportation charges. MSC rates published in the MSC Container Agreement and Rate Guide will
be used for the ocean segment. Code 3 service will be in addition to the other established codes of service, such as Codes
4 and 5. Movement of these shipments will be predicted on the policy, administrative requirements, terms, conditions,
and rules, contained in the International Personal Property Rate Solicitation, the MSC Container Agreement and
Rate Guide, and are subject to the following requirements.

The MSC Worldwide Container Agreement contains authority for MTMC approved ITGBL carriers to use MSC negotiated
ocean rates. Section C&hyph;5 of the Worldwide Agreement defines the Government as the U.S. Government, its agents,
and contractors. The ocean carrier is obligated in accordance with Sections C&hyph;4 and C&hyph;6 of the MSC Worldwide
Container Agreement to transport cargo tendered by the Government. The ocean carrier will perform services in accordance

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Ordering Activity Designation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MTMC, as the Administrative Contracting Officer for MSC will designate ITGBL carriers with accepted Code 3 rates
on file, as ordering activities of the Government. As an ordering activity of the Government, the ITGBL carrier will
have authority to book containers on behalf of the Government within the limits of delegation and subject to Government
oversight. Ordering activity authority will allow the ITGBL carrier to utilize MSC negotiated rates. The ITGBL carrier
will be responsible for exercising its administrative authority in accordance with the delegation authority granted
by MTMC, and with the terms and conditions of the MSC container agreement with oversight by MTMC. ITGBL carriers designated
as ordering activities of the Government will sign an agreement acknowledging the terms, conditions, and responsibilities,
associated with the delegated authority. A listing reflecting those ITGBL carriers designated as ordering activities
of the Government will be provided to the MSC ocean carriers prior to the effective date of the cycle.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Withdrawal of Ordering Activity Authority. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MTMC may revoke the ordering activity authority of any ITGBL carrier who fails to comply with the terms, conditions,
and responsibility associated with use of the MSC negotiated rates. This will preclude the ITGBL carrier from further
participation in Code 3 traffic for the remainder of the solicitation period and cycle. Repetitive violations of
ordering activity authority may result in removal of the ITGBL carrier from further Code 3 participation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4. Ocean Carrier Cargo Allocations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the MSC Container Agreement, the low cost ocean carrier will be offered
75 percent of the available cargo on a given route. The remaining 25 percent of the cargo will be offered to other participating
ocean carriers. All Code 3 HHG shipments, under this test will be offered initially to the low cost ocean carrier and
included in the 75 percent cargo allocations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
5. Ocean Container Bookings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MTMC will provide port information and administrative institutions to ITGBL carriers and adjust such instructions,
as required, to provide for compliance with HHG distribution requirements. ITGBL carriers will be required to adhere
to these instructions. ITGBL carriers will offer all Code 3 shipments to the ocean carrier establishing the lowest
MSC rate for the applicable route unless instructed to do otherwise by MTMC. If the shipments are declined by low cost
ocean carrier, a nonavailability statement will be issued by the ocean carrier and required to accompany the ITGBL
carriers billing to the appropriate Defense Finance and Accounting Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
6. Container Utilization.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ITGBL carriers participating in Code 3 traffic will be required to optimize ocean container utilization. Imposition
of utilization factors are necessary to incentivize optimal loading of containers since MSC rates are based on rates
per measurement ton utilizing 100 percent of the inside cubic capacity of the container regardless of the actual of
HHGs loaded in the container. (See paragraph a. 10.(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
7. Coloading. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To permit carriers ability to continue traditionally accepted commercial coloading practices, carriers may coload
Code 3 shipments. Code 3 shipments may only be coloaded in ocean containers with Code 3 shipments. The ITGBL carrier's
Ordering Activity will be revoked if it is found that Code 3 and Non-Code 3 shipments are coloaded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
8. Payment of Ocean Charges. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ITGBL carrier who orders services from the ocean carrier on behalf of the Government is responsible for payment
of MSC ocean rates to the ocean carrier. Ocean freight charges shall be earned by the MSC ocean carrier upon delivery
of the shipment to the destination named in the shipping order in accordance with MSC's agreements and rate guides.
Payment by the ITGBL carrier shall be made within 30 days after receipt of a proper invoice from the MSC ocean carrier
of evidence of delivery whichever occurs later. ITGBL carriers will be reimbursed for over-ocean movement costs
for Code 3 shipments tendered to the low cost ocean carrier or when a nonavailability statement is provided by the low
cost ocean carrier indicating the shipment was refused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
9. Failure to Pay Ocean Carrier. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the MSC Container Agreement, the Government is responsible for payment
of ocean charges if the ITGBL carrier fails to pay the MSC ocean carrier. MSC will maintain a reserve fund for use in paying
the ocean carrier. MTMC will initiate set-off action against ITGBL carriers for ocean charges, applicable interest,
and any other costs incurred for nonpayment of ocean charges. Designation of ordering activity authority will be
revoked, and the ITGBL carrier will be precluded from further participation in Code 3 traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
10. Reimbursement of Ocean Charges._
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The ITGBL carrier will be reimbursed for its pro rata share of the average ocean charges incurred by the use of MSC's
contract carriers based on the net hundredweight of the HHG shipment. The ITGBL carrier will be paid that portion of
the average ocean charges in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph a.10.(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The ITGBL carrier will be paid its pro rata share of the average ocean charges incurred under Code 3 shipments based
on multiplying the net hundredweight of the HHG shipment shipped with the ITGBL carrier against an MSC determined
ocean rate factor. The MSC ocean rate factor is based on dividing MSC's total ocean charges for the movement of a standard
40
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; by 8
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; by 8
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;6
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; dry ocean container (40
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; standard container) of general cargo over a specific traffic channel by the average amount of net hundredweight
of HHG 
<!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;cargo that can be loaded into that size container. The average net hundredweight of HHG cargo that can be loaded
into a 40
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; standard container is calculated to be 130.41. That 130.41 net hundredweight is calculated by using a load
factor of 10 average size Type II containers (152A) in a 40 standard container. At 189 cubic feet each, these 10 average
Type II containers will hold 13,041 reduced to a hundredweight factor, divided into the MSC calculated per 40
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; standard container rate for a given movement shall be the applicable ocean freight reimbursement factor.
This MSC ocean rate factor is then multiplied against the net hundredweight of the ITGBL carrier's shipment over that
channel and the ITGBL carrier is paid the resulting amount. The predetermined ocean freight reimbursement factor
for each Code 3 channel shall be computed by MSC and provided to the applicable paying office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The ITGBL carrier will bill the appropriate finance and accounting office responsible for payment of transportation
charges for Code 3 shipments. Over-ocean charges will be identified as a separate line item charge on the public Voucher
for Transportation Charges, SF&hyph;1113. An MSC Over-Ocean Charge Item will be included in Chapter V of the International
Personal Property Rate Solicitation. This item number must be reflected on the SF&hyph;1113 with the over-ocean
charge. All billings must be supported by appropriate documents identified in the Tender of Service, Figure A&hyph;8,
of the Personal Property Traffic Management Regulation (PTMR), DOD 4500.34R, with the following exceptions; the
shipping order must be submitted in lieu of billing document number 8, commercial ocean bill of lading, and a copy of
the nonavailability statement must be submitted, in order to justify payment, for those instances where the low MSC
ocean carrier refused the shipment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The CB/NRDA is being conducted by Federal and State agencies and tribal governments identified as Natural Resource
Trustees for the Commencement Bay environment pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CERCLA), the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 33 U.S.C. 2701&hyph;2761 (OPA), and other applicable law. The Trustees will
be developing a RP/EIS to help guide restoration actions associated with the CB/NRDA. The RP/EIS will develop a set
of preferred restoration alternatives and a restoration management plan and will evaluate the environmental impacts
of the proposed plan. The Programmatic EIS will also incorporate and build upon existing information developed in
the Commencement Bay Cumulative Impact Study (CG/CIS) (published 6/93) and information and policies developed
through the CB/NRDA restoration planning process. While this RP/EIS will be a document prepared under NEPA guidelines,
it is anticipated that the RP/EIS will also meet the requirements of the Washington State Environmental Policy Act,
Chapter 43.21C RCW (SEPA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal of the RP/EIS is to develop a restoration management plan that will benefit the natural resources of Commencement
Bay that have been injured as a result of the release of hazardous substances or the discharge of oil. There are two objectives
associated with this goal that will help address the injured trust resources. The first is to provide within the immediate
Commencement Bay environment a diversity of sustainable habitat types using a landscape perspective to directly
benefit the injured resources. The second objective, within the larger study area, is to provide additional alternative
resource and habitat restoration or replacement opportunities, or to acquire the equivalent of the affected resources
or habitats for those injured resources that will require additional efforts to achieve or promote restoration.
Because the planning, selection, design, construction, monitoring and funding of specific restoration measures
will unfold over a period of many years, a tiered EIS process has been selected for environmental compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A preliminary list of alternatives is being developed and will be described in initial scoping documents sent to all
agencies, organizations, and individuals on the RP/EIS mailing list, along with a listing of significant issues
identified by agencies and public comment. The scoping document will include a brief discussion regarding the basis
for the study, information concerning the alternative areas evaluated for restoration, restoration alternative
strategies, and the programmatic nature of the study at each of the alternative areas. This information would be supplemented
with graphics delineating the areas of interest and alternative configurations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EIS Content
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft RP/EIS will document restoration planning at a programmatic level consistent with the results of scoping.
Restoration planning will focus upon the ``key resources'' identified through the CG/NRDA process as having been
injured due to releases of hazardous substances or discharges of oil. Beginning with the information developed through
the CB/NRDA restoration planning process and the CB/CIS, the draft RP/EIS will identify habitat types and functions
significant for important life stages of one or more groups of key resources or of representative individual key resource
species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RP/EIS will effectively serve as a menu of restoration alternatives to function as a framework for managing the
Commencement Bay NRDA Restoration Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Alternative section will be based on the following:

Cooperating Agencies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several agencies have been identified as cooperating agencies. They are: The Puyallup Tribe of Indians, the Muckleshoot
Indian Tribe, the Washington Department of Ecology, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Environmental Protection
Agency. The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has been designated by the lead agencies as the primary agent for preparing
the RP/EIS.

Study Area
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The study area for the RP/EIS includes Commencement Bay (that portion of Puget Sound enclosed within a line extending
from Brown's Point to Point Defiance); the watershed of Commencement Bay and its main tributaries (the Puyallup/Carbon
River, the White River, Hylebos Creek, Wapato Creek, Puget Creek); and Puget Sound coastal areas adjacent to Commencement
Bay (southern Vashon and Maury Islands, Dumas Bay). Within the study area, the RP/EIS will focus on those areas that
serve as habitat for or otherwise support the natural resources of Commencement Bay potentially injured as a result
of releases of CERCLA hazardous substances and discharges of oil.

Institutions that become Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO participants will be required to increase the Institutional
Capital Contribution (ICC) to at least a dollar-for-dollar match with any portion of the 1994&hyph;95 award year
Federal Capital Contribution (FCC) received. Only new FCC received on or after July 1, 1994, would be matched at the
increased rate. Institutions would not match funds received prior to July 1, 1994, at the higher rate. Institutions
receiving no new FCC for the 1994&hyph;95 award year may still elect to participate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program
ELO.

Institutions that become Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO participants may make loans to eligible students at higher
maximum annual and aggregate limits than is the case with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonparticipating institutions. ELO participating institutions that do not ultimately make any loans at the higher
ELO levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the 1994&hyph;95 award year must still honor the ELO Participation Agreement to deposit in the Federal Perkins
Loan Program Fund an ICC at least equal to the 1994&hyph;95 award year FCC deposited into the Fund. All other administrative
procedures would remain the same as for institutions not participating in the Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO.

 Under section 456 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA), 20 U.S.C. 1234e (1982) (in effect in August of 1988
when the final audit determination was received by the auditee), the Secretary of Education (Secretary) intends
to repay to the Idaho State Division of Vocational Education (Idaho), under a grantback arrangement, an amount equal
to 75 percent of the principal amount of funds recovered by the U.S. Department of Education (Department) as a result
of the final audit determination in this matter. The Department's recovery of funds followed a settlement reached
between the parties under which Idaho refunded a total of $115,000 in principal to the Department in full resolution
of the Department's final audit determination. This notice describes Idaho's plan for the use of the repaid funds
and the terms and conditions under which the Secretary intends to make those funds available. This notice invites
comments on the proposed grantback.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under a settlement agreement between the Department and Idaho, the Department recovered $115,000 from Idaho in full
resolution of all claims arising from an audit of Idaho's State Division of Vocational Education, covering fiscal
years (FYs) 1983 through 1985. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's original claim of $376,538 was contained in a final letter of determination issued by the Assistant
Secretary for Vocational and Adult Education on August 8, 1988. The claim arose from findings related to Idaho's administration
of its vocational education program under provisions of the Vocational Education Act of 1963, 20 U.S.C. 2301, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1982) (VEA). In the August 8, 1991 letter, the Assistant Secretary determined that Idaho had violated the prohibition
against supplanting State and local funds with Federal funds awarded under the VEA. The supplanting prohibition
was contained in section 106(a)(6) of the VEA (20 U.S.C. 2306 (a)(6))(1982), in effect at the time. The Assistant Secretary
had also determined that Idaho had improperly awarded vocational education funds to local educational agencies
(LEAs) that failed to meet the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement in section 111(b)(1) of the VEA (20 U.S.C. 2311(b)(1))(1982),
in effect at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In responding to these findings, Idaho asserted that the MOE violations resulted when it misinterpreted the VEA's
MOE requirements, using the wrong years when calculating MOE for compliance purposes. Idaho further asserted that
the supplanting violations resulted from Idaho's attempts to mitigate potential maintenance of effort problems
at the local level. The VEA requirements relating to local maintenance of effort, which were among the primary subjects
of the August 8, 1988 final letter of determination issued to Idaho, are no longer in effect. Under the current program
authority, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins II), local educational
agencies (LEAs) are not required to maintain local effort (20 U.S.C. 2463(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The settlement negotiations that followed Idaho's appeal of the Assistant Secretary's August 8, 1988 determination
in this matter culminated in a settlement agreement in which Idaho agreed to repay $115,000 to the Department. The
settlement agreement was executed on September 29, 1991. On December 11, 1991, the Department received full payment
from Idaho in the amount of $115,000.

B. Authority for Awarding a Grantback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 456(a) of GEPA, 20 U.S.C. 1234e(a), the authority applicable to this grantback request, provides that whenever
the Secretary has recovered funds following a final audit determination with respect to any applicable program,
the Secretary may consider those funds to be additional funds available for the program and may arrange to repay to
the State or local education agency affected by that determination an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the recovered
funds. The Secretary may enter into this grantback arrangement if the Secretary determines that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The practices and procedures of the State or local education agency that resulted in the audit determination have
been corrected, and the State or local agency is, in all other respects, in compliance with the requirements of the
applicable program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State or local agency has submitted to the Secretary a plan for the use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback
arrangement, which meets the requirements of the program, and, to the extent possible, benefits the population that
was affected by the failure to comply or by the misexpenditures that resulted in the audit exception; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement in accordance with the State or local agency's
plan would serve to achieve the purposes of the program under which funds were originally granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Plan for Use of Funds Awarded Under a Grantback Arrangement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 456(a)(2) of GEPA, Idaho has applied for a grantback of $86,250, or 75 percent of the $115,000 repaid
to the Department under the settlement agreement, and has submitted a plan for use of the proposed grantback funds,
consistent with Perkins II, currently in effect. Generally, Idaho plans to purchase vocational-technical training
equipment to improve vocational-technical programs in Idaho's State system of vocational and applied technology
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Idaho plans to utilize the requested grantback funds totaling $86,250 to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Replace outdated equipment in the electronics program at North Idaho College, School of Vocational-Technical
Education by purchasing two Oscilloscopes ($7,000); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Purchase two Pentium Work Stations necessary for establishing an interdivisional CD ROM Instructional Lab at
Lewis-Clark State College, School of Technology ($5,625); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Purchase equipment needed by Boise State University, College of Technology, to implement an Academic Skills
Development unit at the Canyon County Center ($23,445); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Purchase updated equipment for the Licensed Practical Nurse and Welding programs at the College of Southern Idaho
School of Vocational-Technical Education ($12,500); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Purchase equipment for establishing an integrated learning experience laboratory at Idaho State University,
School of Applied Technology ($22,680); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Purchase an Eberline HBM&hyph;1 Hand/Foot counter to be used in the Radiation Safety program at Eastern Idaho
Technical College ($15,000). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The postsecondary institutions for which Idaho plans to purchase equipment with the grantback funds will participate
with comprehensive high schools in the various regions in which the institutions are located throughout the State
to deliver Tech-Prep programs and coordinate initiatives for future delivery of youth apprenticeship training.
As is indicated in Idaho's grantback plan, the additional equipment Idaho plans to purchase will serve to advance
the quality of programs delivered by, and coordinated through, the postsecondary State system, resulting in Statewide
benefit to vocational education, and maximizing the impact of the grantback funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Idaho's plan further indicates that these equipment purchases are intended to improve vocational-technical programs
by maintaining high-quality State programs with state-of-the-art training stations. These training stations
will be of critical importance in advancing the development of Idaho's workforce. Laboratories in the postsecondary
vocational-technical education system will provide preparatory training essential for new entrants into highly
skilled occupations. In addition, industry upgrade and retraining of employees will be provided on the campuses
of Idaho's postsecondary system of technical institutions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under a Settlement Agreement negotiated between the Department and Iowa, the Department recovered $127,600 from
Iowa in full resolution of all claims arising from an audit of Iowa's State Department of Education, covering fiscal
year (FY) 1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's original claim of $338,128 was contained in a final letter of determination issues by the Assistant
Secretary for Vocational and Adult Education (Assistant Secretary) on September 29, 1989. The claim arose from findings
related to Iowa's allocation of vocational education program payroll expenditures under provisions of the Carl
D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 2301, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1988) (Perkins I). In the September 29, 1989, letter the Assistant Secretary determined that Iowa had violated the
Federal requirements that salaries of employees chargeable to more than one program o other cost objectives be supported
by appropriate time distribution records. The Federal requirements are derived from Office of Management and Budget
Circular No. A&hyph;87, Attachment B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The settlement negotiations which followed Iowa's appeal of the Assistant Secretary's September 29, 1989, determination
in this matter culminated in a tentative Settlement Agreement being reached between the parties in which Iowa agreed
to repay $127,600 to the Department. The Settlement Agreement was executed on February 5, 1991. On February 20, 1991,
the Department received full payment from Iowa in the amount of $127,600.

B. Authority for Awarding a Grantback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 459(a) of GEPA, 20 U.S.C. 1234h(a), provides that whenever the Secretary has recovered funds following a
final audit determination, the Secretary may consider those funds to be additional funds available for the program
and may arrange to repay to the State or local agency affected by that determination an amount not to exceed 75 percent
of the recovered funds. The Secretary may enter into this grantback arrangement if the Secretary determines that:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The practices and procedures of the State or local agency that resulted in the audit determination have been corrected,
and the State or local agency is, in all other respects, in compliance with the requirements of the applicable program;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State or local agency has submitted to the Secretary a plan for the use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback
arrangement which meets the requirements of the program and, to the extent possible, benefits the population that
was affected by the failure to comply or by the misexpenditures that resulted in the audit exception; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement in accordance with the State or local agency's
plan would serve to achieve the purposes of the program under which funds were originally granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Plan for Use of Funds Awarded Under a Grantback Arrangement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 459(a)(2) of GEPA, Iowa has applied for a grantback of $95,700_75 percent of the $127,600 repaid
to the Department_and has submitted a plan for use of the proposed grantback funds, consistent with the Carl D. Perkins
Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of 1990 (Perkins II). Iowa plans to utilize the requested grantback
funds, totaling $95,700, to purchase computer equipment, software, and printers to be used to design new systems
and improve existing systems of administering Perkins II, including: (1) Reviewing local applications; (2) monitoring
and evaluating program effectiveness; (3) providing technical assistance to grant recipients; (4) ensuring compliance
with all applicable Federal laws, including required services and activities for individuals who are members of
special populations; and (5) supporting the activities of technical committees established under 34 C.F.R. &sect;403.12(b)(1).
Iowa's plan further indicates that this equipment will supplement and enhance Iowa's ability to achieve the goals
and objectives of the current State plan (FYs 1995 and 1996). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The equipment purchased with the grantback funds will permit administrative activities under Perkins II funds to
use a local area network and all personnel involved in administering the Perkins II programs will have direct access
to that network and information regarding Perkins II grant awards, recipients, and applications. The results of
the use and availability of this equipment are expected to be (1) Improved quality and compliance monitoring, and
the evaluation of program effectiveness by facilitating timely access to needed information and standardizing
report formats; (2) improved capacity for staff to provide, in a more timely manner, written responses to requests
for technical assistance and to track technical issues; (3) shared information among staff responsible for Perkins
II administration through use of an electronic mail system; (4) reduction in time spent preparing reports; and (5)
facilitation of the collection of data and statistical analysis leading to better evaluation and targeting of technical
assistance to programs and populations with the greatest needs.

D. The Secretary's Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has carefully reviewed the plan submitted by Iowa. Based upon that review and a review of other information,
the Secretary has determined that the conditions under section 459 of GEPA have been met. This determination is based
upon the best information available to the Secretary at the present time. If this information is not accurate or complete,
the Secretary is not precluded from taking appropriate administrative action. In finding that the conditions of
section 459 of GEPA have been met, the Secretary makes no determination concerning any pending audit recommendations
or final audit determinations.

 The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires the Secretary of Energy to prepare a least-cost energy plan a resource and technology
inventory of the least-cost energy strategy. The inventory (1) provides a description of each current and anticipated
primary energy input available to the U.S. economy, (2) describes the system for electricity generation and distribution,
and (3) lists available and anticipated energy technologies that are sufficiently defined so as to permit measurement
or estimation of their cost and effectiveness over the period from the present to the year 2015. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 1602 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) requires the Department to provide a Least-Cost Energy Strategy
(LCES) to accompany the National Energy Policy Plan (NEPP) it submits pursuant to the legislation that established
the Department. Implicitly, EPAct recognizes that the LCES and the NEPP are distinct, reflecting in part the fact
that least-cost modeling exercises may fail to account for important real-world considerations that may enter into
energy policy formulation. Notwithstanding this distinction, the LCES can be an important source of insights for
use in developing energy policy. It can also provide important insights into other issues facing the Department,
such as strategic planning, the identification of research and development priorities, long-term climate mitigation
policy, and sustainable development initiatives, by identifying energy-related technologies that have the largest
leverage on attainment of social objectives related to the nexus of energy and economic growth.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The least-cost strategy will provide a list of policy options that, when implemented, could meet the goals and reflect
the priorities outlined in Section 1602 of EPAct. The least-cost strategy will call upon available and anticipated
resources and technologies to satisfy final energy demands at minimum long-run cost, subject to these goals and priorities.
Section 1602(a) lists the following goals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Stabilization and eventual reduction in the generation of greenhouse gases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An increase in the efficiency of the Nation's total energy use by 30 percent over 1988 levels by 2010 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An increase in the percentage of energy derived from renewable resources by 75 percent over 1988 levels by the
year 2005
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A reduction in the nation's oil consumption from the 1990 level of approximately 40 percent of total energy
use to 35 percent by the year 2005.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In addition, Section 1602(d) lists the following energy production, utilization, and energy conservation
priorities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Implement standards for more efficient use of fossil fuels; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Increase the energy efficiency of existing technologies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Encourage technologies, including clean coal technologies, that generate lower levels of greenhouse gases;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Promote the use of renewable energy resources, including solar, geothermal, and sustainable biomass, hydropower,
and wind power; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Affect the development and consumption of energy and energy efficiency resources and electricity through
tax policy; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Encourage investment in energy efficient equipment and technologies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Encourage the development of energy technologies, such as advanced nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, that
produce energy without greenhouse gases as a byproduct, and encourage the deployment of nuclear electric generating
capacity.

II. Content of the Energy Resources and Technology Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 1602(b) of EPAct requires an inventory of energy resources and technology. Conservation technologies,
which reduce the amount of energy required to provide a given energy service, are considered as energy technologies
for purposes of this inventory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the inventory, known and anticipated primary energy inputs will be inventoried. These include coal, oil
and gas (both domestic and imported), renewable sources (including diverse solar forms, biomass, wind and ocean
energy, hydro, geothermal, and municipal waste methane), nuclear, hydrogen, and synthetic fuels and coal gases.

Some technologies included in the inventory, such as the power plant example presented above, are cohesive single
engineering processes. In other cases, a technology in the inventory will reflect an aggregation of engineering
innovations, reflecting our inability to separately model each individual device. For example, a future vehicle
technology might embody several innovations such as ultra light-weight construction, low rolling resistance tires,
hybrid propulsion with automatic engine shut-off, and regenerative braking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suggestions and comments are invited on both the addition of categories for the Energy Resource and Technology Inventory
and for the nomination of specific technologies to be included. To be considered for inclusion, a technology must
be sufficiently concrete that parameters for its cost, performance and applicability to the U.S. economy are discernible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents are invited to suggest either single technologies or logical aggregates of technologies, as in the examples
above, so long as the performance parameters can be described in terms similar to those in the example provided above.
Respondents are requested to provide performance parameters in a standard format (Appendix A) for technologies
that they nominate for the technology inventory, but may supplement this minimum requirement with additional information.

III. Least-Cost Concepts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The term ``least-cost'' is open to various interpretations. Depending on how the term is defined, a wide variety of
energy strategies might be categorized as meeting a least-cost criterion. It is our intent to explore strategies
consistent with a variety of ``least-cost'' concepts reflecting alternative treatments of issues including, but
not limited to, private versus social cost minimization, environmental impacts, and the role of non-modeled attributes
and institutional factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
Private and Social Cost Minimization
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
It is widely accepted that private and social costs may fail to coincide unless all markets are perfectly competitive.
Energy-related markets provide many instances where the assumption of competition may be called into question.
For example, pricing in electricity markets, which are generally subject to economic regulation at the state level,
are based on average, not marginal, costs. Least-cost decisions based on the prices actually paid by electricity
users may differ from least-cost decisions based on marginal costs. Capital markets provide another example of possible
departures from perfect competition. Capital costs may differ significantly from the social opportunity cost of
investment, and vary widely across and within groups of decisionmakers. Projects that minimize costs using social
discount rates may fail to do so at discount rates reflecting the opportunity cost of capital faced by decisionmakers
in the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE plans to consider a wide range of cases that reflect the differences between social and private cost minimization,
and consider how each affects least-cost choices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
Environmental Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Environmental impacts can also enter into the definition of a ``least cost'' energy strategy. For example, in a case
where two technologies that differ widely in energy efficiency can be used to provide the same energy service, purchasers
will often ignore the social costs of environmental impacts that may be associated with higher levels of energy use.
Theory and regulatory practice in some states suggests that this issue can be addressed by incorporating a ``shadow
price'' for environmental impacts in the least-cost objective function. The least-cost strategy will consider
alternative approaches to addressing the impact of recognizing environmental costs on least-cost choices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
Role of Non-Modeled Attributes and Institutional Factors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
No model can adequately capture the full detail of all influences on energy-related decisions. For example, decisions
regarding personal transportation technologies may involve issues such as safety, performance, and room, as well
as tradeoffs between acquisition cost and fuel cost. Institutional factors, such as the divorce between ownership
and tenancy in many commercial buildings, can also have an important influence on energy-related decisions. Ignoring
the range of attributes that enter into consumer decisions or institutional factors could lead to ``apples to oranges''
cost comparisons that do not compare alternative approaches to providing the same service. On the other hand, adoption
of a pure ``revealed preference'' approach, in which the fact that a particular technology is used in the market is
prima facie evidence of its least-cost nature, is both tautological and inconsistent with the spirit of the least-cost
strategy exercise. Given the unsuitability of the two extremes, we intend to explore a range of intermediate cases.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public is invited to comment on these issues, as well as others that may bear on the interpretation or definition
of the ``least-cost'' concept. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
IV. Least-Cost Modeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The methods selected for developing the least cost energy plan include use of the optimization model known as MARKAL&hyph;MACRO
described in ``MARKAL&hyph;MACRO: A linked model for energy-economy analysis,'' BNL&hyph;47161, Brookhaven
National Laboratory, February 1992. Copies of this report are available by request from the Office of Economic Analysis
and Competition (202) 586&hyph;4767. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MARKAL&hyph;MACRO links the MARKAL model that is used to determine least-cost provision of fixed end-use energy
service demands with the substitution opportunities between energy services and other productive inputs in MACRO.
MARKAL is an optimization model that minimizes the cost of providing its target level of energy services drawing on
the available set technology and resources. Information from the energy resource and technology inventory is directly
reflected in the MARKAL data structure, so that changes in the parameters for technologies already represented or
the inclusion of new technologies may significantly influence the modeling results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In MACRO the inputs of capital, labor and energy services are substitutes for each other under an assumption of diminishing
marginal returns. With the link between MARKAL and MACRO, rising energy costs can change the composition of energy
supply, of energy technologies and of energy investments (through MARKAL), and may also change the balance among
energy services, labor and capital input decisions, and affect future output levels (via the MACRO link).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The draft strategic plan sets forth EE's goals, objectives, and strategies for program implementation. EE will use
this draft document as part of a comprehensive planning process involving stakeholders and oriented toward careful
identification and thorough analysis of strategic issues. The outcome of the effort will be a final version of the
strategic plan and a five-year program plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft strategic plan is divided into four sections: overview, mission and vision, goals and objectives, and EE
strategy. The EE goals and objectives are aligned with those expressed in the Department of Energy's strategic plan,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fueling a Competitive Economy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The strategy section addresses EE's technology, market, and organizational strategies. A series of short appendices
is also included in the draft strategic plan: situation analysis, description of EE stakeholder categories, description
of EE sectors' individualized missions, and evolution of EE's strategic planning process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of its strategic planning process, EE is sponsoring the development of ten issue papers that analyze driving
forces and trends and present options for EE's objectives and strategies vis-a-vis sustainable development, pollution
prevention, electric utility restructuring, natural gas utilization, and other issues. Participation in the workshop
discussion is by invitation, and limited to individuals who have been actively involved in the analysis and review
of these issues on behalf of EE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the workshop is to provide feedback to EE on whether its draft strategic plan adequately addresses needs
identified in issues analyses. Workshop participants will review the goals, objectives and strategies in the draft
strategic plan to see if they are consistent with the issues analyses. Anticipated products from the workshop include
options for revised or new goals and objectives; technology, market, and organizational strategies that better
reflect the insights gained in the issues analyses; and ideas for near-term activities designed to set an immediate
course for progress on each issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The workshop will be structured to elicit individual views, not to reach consensus. Members of the general public
are invited to observe the workshop, and submit written comments on the draft strategic plan by the previously noticed
September 30 deadline. The views expressed at the meetings will be considered in revising the strategic plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set
out below. The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute
to eligible claimants $100,697.87, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE pursuant to a June 21, 1982 Remedial
Order. In the Remedial Order, the DOE found that, during the period August 1, 1979 through March 31, 1980, Beacon Bay
had sold motor gasoline at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling price, in violation of Federal petroleum
price regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OHA has tentatively determined to distribute the funds obtained from Beacon Bay in two stages. In the first stage,
we will accept claims from identifiable purchasers of gasoline from Beacon Bay who may have been injured by overcharges.
The specific requirements which an applicant must meet in order to receive a refund are set out in Section IV of the Proposed
Decision. Claimants who meet these specific requirements will be eligible to receive refunds based on the number
of gallons of gasoline which they purchased from Beacon Bay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If any funds remain after valid claims are paid in the first stage, they may be used for indirect restitution in accordance
with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501-07.
Applications for Refund should not be filed at this time. Appropriate public notice will be provided prior to the acceptance
of claims. Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting
parties are requested to provide two copies of their submissions. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publication
of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. All comments received in this proceeding
will be available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal
holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E-234, 1000 Independence
Ave., S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition
for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) to distribute the
funds which Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc. (Beacon Bay) remitted to the DOE pursuant to a June 21, 1982 Remedial Order.
Beacon Bay has remitted $100,697.87 pursuant to the order, to which $3,131.82 in interest has accrued as of July 31,
1994. In accordance with the provisions of the procedural regulations at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V (subpart V), the
ERA requests in its Petition that the OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects
of regulatory violations set forth in the Remedial Order. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan
to distribute these funds.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period relevant to this proceeding, Beacon Bay operated 11 retail service stations in Southern California.
The ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Beacon Bay on July 29, 1980. The PRO alleged that, during the period
August 1, 1979, through March 31, 1980, Beacon Bay sold motor gasoline at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling
price, in violation of Federal petroleum price regulations. The DOE amended the PRO and issued a Final Remedial Order
on June 21, 1982, after considering Beacon Bay's objections to the PRO. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Beacon Bay Enterprises, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9 DOE &para; 83,039 (1982). On August 23, 1982, Beacon Bay appealed the DOE's Final Remedial Order to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). The FERC issued a Proposed Order, on November 15, 1982, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Beacon Bay Enterprises, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 FERC &para; 62,295 (1982), and an Order, on January 25, 1983, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Beacon Bay Enterprises, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22 FERC &para; 61,059 (1983) the two of which affirmed and adopted the DOE's Final Remedial Order. Beacon Bay has since
remitted $100,697.87 to the DOE, in compliance with the Remedial Order, which is now available (the Beacon Bay Remedial
Order fund) for distribution through Subpart V.

II. Jurisdiction and Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing
a plan for the distribution of funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart
V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion
procedures to distribute refunds, see

We have considered the ERA's Petition that we implement a Subpart V proceeding with respect to the Beacon Bay Remedial
Order fund and have determined that such a proceeding is appropriate. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth
the OHA's tentative plan to distribute this fund. We intend to publicize our proposal and solicit comments from interested
parties before taking the actions proposed in this Decision. Comments regarding the tentative distribution process
set forth in this Proposed Decision and Order should be filed with the OHA within 30 days of its publication in the

III. Proposed Refund Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to implement a two-stage refund procedure for distribution of the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund. In the
first stage, purchasers of gasoline from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order may submit Applications
for Refund. From our experience with Subpart V proceedings, we expect that potential applicants generally will fall
into the following categories: (i) end-users; (ii) regulated entities, such as cooperatives; and (iii) resellers
and retailers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claims Based Upon Overcharges.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to receive a refund, each claimant will be required to submit a schedule of its monthly purchases of gasoline
from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order_August 1979 through March 1980. If the gasoline was
not purchased directly from Beacon Bay, the claimant must establish that the gasoline originated with Beacon Bay.
Additionally, a reseller or retailer claimant, except one who chooses to utilize the injury presumptions set forth
below, will be required to make a detailed showing that it was injured by Beacon Bay's overcharges. This showing will
generally consist of two distinct elements. First, a reseller or retailer claimant will be required to show that it
had ``banks'' of unrecouped increased product costs in excess of the refund claimed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Second, because a showing of banked costs alone is not sufficient to establish injury, a claimant must additionally
provide evidence that market conditions precluded it from increasing its prices to pass through the additional costs
associated with the overcharges. See

Claimants who have previously relied upon their banked costs in order to obtain refunds in other special refund proceedings
should subtract those refunds from any cost banks submitted in this refund proceeding. See

Our experience also indicates that the use of certain presumptions permits claimants to participate in the refund
process without incurring inordinate expense and ensures that refund claims are evaluated in the most efficient
manner possible. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Presumptions in refund cases are specifically authorized by the applicable Subpart V regulations at 10 C.F.R.
205.282(e). Accordingly, we propose to adopt the presumptions set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Calculation of Refunds. First, we will adopt a presumption that the overcharges were dispersed equally in all of
Beacon Bay's sales of gasoline during the period covered by the Remedial Order. In accordance with this presumption,
refunds are made on a pro-rata or volumetric basis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the absence of better information, a volumetric refund is appropriate because the DOE price regulations generally
required a regulated firm to account for increased costs on a firm-wide basis in determining its prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
If an individual claimant believes that it was injured by more than its volumetric share, it may elect to forego this
presumption and file a refund application based upon a claim that it suffered a disproportionate share of Beacon Bay's
overcharges. See,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
 e.g., Mobil Oil Corp./Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Co.,

Mobil Oil Corp./Marine Corps Exchange Service,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 17 DOE &para; 85,714 (1988). Such a claim will be granted if the claimant makes a persuasive showing that it was ``overcharged''
by a specific amount, and that it absorbed those overcharges. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co./Western Petroleum Co., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
19 DOE &para; 85,705 (1989). To the degree that a claimant makes this showing, it will receive an above-volumetric
refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the volumetric approach, a claimant's ``allocable share'' of the Remedial Order fund is equal to the number
of gallons purchased from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order times the per gallon refund amount.
In the present case, the per gallon refund amount is $0.0690. We derived this figure by dividing the amount of the Remedial
Order fund, $100,697.87, by 1,460,321 gallons, the volume of gasoline which Beacon Bay sold from August 1, 1979, through
March 31, 1980. A claimant that establishes its eligibility for a refund will receive all or a portion of its allocable
share plus a pro-rata share of the accrued interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As in previous cases, we propose to establish a minimum refund amount of $15. In this proceeding, any potential claimant
purchasing less than 211 gallons of gasoline from Beacon Bay would have an allocable share of less than $15. We have
found through our experience that the cost of processing claims in which refunds for amounts less than $15 are sought
outweighs the benefits of restitution in those instances. See

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the volumetric presumption, we also propose to adopt a number of presumptions regarding injury for
claimants in each category listed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. End-Users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, we propose to adopt the presumption that an end-user or ultimate consumer
of gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay whose business is unrelated to the petroleum industry was injured by the overcharges
resolved by the Remedial Order. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., Texas Oil and Gas Corp.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 12 DOE &para; 85,069 at 88,209 (1984) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
TOGCO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Unlike regulated firms in the petroleum industry, members of this group generally were not subject to price controls
during the period covered by the Remedial Order, and were not required to keep records which justified selling price
increases by reference to cost increases. Consequently, analysis of the impact of the overcharges on the final prices
of goods and services produced by members of this group would be beyond the scope of the refund proceeding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We therefore propose that the end-users of gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay need only document their purchase volumes
from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order to make a sufficient showing that they were injured
by the overcharges.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Regulated Firms and Cooperatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We further propose that, in order to receive a full volumetric refund, a claimant whose prices for goods and services
are regulated by a governmental agency, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a public utility, or an agricultural cooperative which is required by its charter to pass through cost savings to its
member-purchasers, need only submit documentation of purchases used by itself or, in the case of a cooperative, sold
to its members. However, a regulated firm or a cooperative will also be required to certify that it will pass any refund
received through to its customers or member-customers, provide us with a full explanation of how it plans to accomplish
the restitution, and certify that it will notify the appropriate regulatory body or membership group of the receipt
of the refund. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Marathon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14 DOE at 88,514&hyph;15. This requirement is based upon the presumption that, with respect to a regulated firm, any
overcharges would have been routinely passed through to its customers. Similarly, any refunds received should be
passed through to its customers. With respect to a cooperative, in general, the cooperative agreement which controls
its business operations would ensure that the overcharges, and similarly refunds, would be passed through to its
member-customers. Accordingly, these firms will not be required to make a detailed demonstration of injury.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Resellers and Retailers. a. Small Claims Presumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to adopt a ``small claims'' presumption that a firm which resold gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay and
requests a small refund was injured by the overcharges. Under the small claims presumption, a reseller or retailer
seeking a refund of $5,000 or less, exclusive of interest, will not be required to submit evidence of injury beyond
documentation of the volume of gasoline it purchased from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order.
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
TOGCO,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 12 DOE at 88,210. This presumption is based on the fact that there may be considerable expense involved in gathering
the types of data necessary to support a detailed claim of injury; for small claims the expense might possibly exceed
the potential refund. Consequently, failure to allow simplified refund procedures for small claims could deprive
injured parties of their opportunity to obtain a refund. Furthermore, use of the small claims presumption is desirable
in that it allows the OHA to process the large number of routine refund claims expected in an efficient manner.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Mid-Level Claim Presumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a reseller or retailer claimant whose allocable share of the refund pool exceeds $5,000, excluding interest,
may elect to receive as its refund either $5,000 or 40 percent of its allocable share.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The use of this presumption reflects our conviction that these larger, mid-level claimants were likely to have experienced
some injury as a result of the overcharges. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Marathon,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 14 DOE at 88,515. In some prior special refund proceedings, we have performed detailed analyses in order to determine
product-specific levels of injury. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., Getty Oil Co.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 15 DOE &para; 85,064 (1986). However, in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gulf Oil Corp., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16 DOE &para; 85,381 at 88,737 (1987), we determined that based upon the available data, it was more accurate and efficient
to adopt a single presumptive level of injury of 40 percent for all mid-level claimants, regardless of the refined
product that they purchased, based upon the results of our analyses in prior proceedings. We believe that approach
generally to be sound, and we therefore propose to adopt a 40 percent presumptive level of injury for all mid-level
claimants in this proceeding. Consequently, an applicant in this group will only be required to provide documentation
of its purchase volumes of gasoline from Beacon Bay during the Remedial Order period in order to be eligible to receive
a refund of 40 percent of its total allocable share or $5,000, whichever is greater.

Under the mid-level presumption, a claimant which purchased between 72,471 gallons and 181,177 gallons of gasoline
from Beacon Bay would be eligible to receive a principal refund, exclusive of interest, of $5,000. A claimant purchasing
more than 181,177 gallons of petroleum products would be eligible for a principal refund equal to 40 percent of its
allocable share.

A claimant who attempts to make a detailed showing of injury in order to obtain 100 percent of its allocable share but,
instead, provides evidence that leads us to conclude that it passed through all of the overcharges, or that it was injured
in an amount less than the presumed level refund, may not necessarily receive a full presumption-based refund. Instead,
such a claimant may receive a refund which reflects the level of injury established in its application.

c. Spot Purchasers. We propose to adopt a rebuttable presumption that a reseller or retailer that made only spot purchases
from Beacon Bay did not suffer injury as a result of those purchases. As we have previously stated, spot purchasers
generally had considerable discretion as to the timing and location of their purchases, and therefore would not have
made spot market purchases from a firm at increased prices unless they were able to pass through the full amount of the
firm's selling price to their own customers.

See, e.g., Vaqueros,

In prior proceedings, we have stated that refunds will be approved for spot purchasers who demonstrated that: (1)
they made the spot purchases for the purpose of ensuring a supply for their base period customers rather than in anticipation
of financial advantage as a result of those purchases, and (2) they were forced by market conditions to resell the product
at a loss that was not subsequently recouped through the draw down of banks. See,

This information with regard to some filing services has already been requested and received by this Office. Therefore,
any filing service that has had more than 10 Applications for Refund approved before the issuance of this Proposed
Decision and Order need not submit this information if it has already done so in another proceeding. Instead, such
a filing service need only include a copy of the previous submission(s) responsive to items (1)&hyph;(5) and provide
an update if its response to any of these questions has changed since it first submitted its information. However,
in light of the importance of this information, it is prudent for all filing services to review their practices and
inform the OHA of any alterations or improvements that may have been made.

(1) A description of the procedures used to solicit refund applications in the Beacon Bay proceeding and copies of
any solicitation materials mailed to prospective Beacon Bay applicants;

Upon receipt of this information, we may suggest alteration of a filing service's procedures if they do not conform
to the procedural requirements of 10 C.F.R. Part 205 and this proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, we will require strict compliance with the filing requirements as specified in 10 C.F.R. &sect;205.283,
particularly the requirement that applications and the accompanying certification statement be signed by the applicant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in any case where an application has been signed and dated before the issuance of the final Decision and Order
in this proceeding, we will require a certification statement, signed and dated by the applicant after the date of
the issuance of the final Decision and Order. This certification should state that the applicant has not filed and
will not file any other Application for Refund in the Beacon Bay proceeding and that, after having been provided a copy
of the final Decision and Order, it still authorizes that filing service to represent it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, we will require from each representative a statement certifying that it maintains a separate escrow account
at a bank or other financial institution for the deposit of all refunds received on behalf of applicants, and that its
normal business practice is to deposit all Subpart V refund checks in that account within two business days of receipt
and to disburse refunds to applicants within 30 calendar days thereafter. Unless such certification is received
by the OHA, all refund checks approved will be made payable solely to the applicant. Representatives who have not previously
submitted an escrow certification form to the OHA may obtain a copy of the appropriate form by contacting:

Distribution of Funds Remaining After First Stage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose that any funds that remain after all first stage claims have been decided be distributed in accordance with
the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;4501&hyph;07.
The PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not
be required to refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments
for use in four energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to the OHA, and
any funds in the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund that the OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution
to injured customers will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the PODRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It Is Therefore Ordered That: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc. pursuant to the Remedial Order
issued on June 21, 1982, will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership; Availability of the Environmental Assessment for the proposed Cove Point LNG

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has prepared an Environmental Assessment
(EA) on the liquefaction unit and recommissioning of existing facilities proposed by Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership
(Cove Point LNG) in the above-referenced docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that
approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The construction and operation of a 15.0 million cubic feet per day liquefaction unit; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Recommissioning of onshore facilities at Cove Point LNG's existing Cove Point LNG terminal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the proposed project would be to provide up to 5,000,000 dekatherms of storage and up to 1,000,000 dekatherms
per day sendout for peak winter demand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA will be placed in the public files of the FERC on August 26, 1994 and will be available for public inspection at:
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Division of Public Information, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Room 3104,
Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;1371.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the EA have been mailed to Federal, state and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
newspapers, and parties to this proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A limited number of copies of the EA are available from: Mr. Hugh Thomas, Environmental Project Manager, Environmental
Review and Compliance Branch I, Office of Pipeline Regulation, Room 7303, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington,
DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;0980.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Written comments must reference Docket No. CP94&hyph;59&hyph;000,
and be addressed to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E.,
Washington, D.C. 20426.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments should be filed as soon as possible, but must be received no later than September 26, 1994, to ensure consideration
prior to a Commission decision on this proposal. A copy of any comments should be sent to Mr. Hugh Thomas, Environmental
Project Manager, Room 7303, at the same address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments will be considered by the Commission but will not serve to make the commentor a party to the proceeding. Any
person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by &sect;385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your comments considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Take notice that on August 18, 1994, High Island Offshore System (HIOS), pursuant to Section 4 (e) of the Natural Gas
Act and &sect;154.67 of the Commission's Regulations, filed to place into effect on September 1, 1994, subject to
refund, the tariff sheets reflecting a change in rates and charges that were suspended in this proceeding by the Commission's
Order of March 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in accordance with the Commission's May 31, 1994, order clarifying the March 31, 1994, suspension order,
HIOS moves to place into effect on September 1, 1994, the suspended tariff sheets, without refund condition, which
eliminate its Interruptible Revenue Crediting Mechanism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 1, 1994, HIOS filed revised tariff sheets with the Commission that provided for a general increase in the rates
for HIOS' jurisdictional transportation services. In such filing, HIOS also included tariff sheets which eliminated
its Interruptible Revenue Crediting Mechanism. On March 31, 1994, the Commission issued an order that, among other
things, accepted HIOS' tariff sheets and suspended them for five months, or until September 1, 1994. As to the tariff
sheets which eliminated HIOS' Interruptible Revenue Crediting Mechanism, the Commission provided in its March
31, 1994, suspension that they could go into effect on September 1, 1994, subject to refund and hearing. However, in
its May 31, 1994, ``Order Clarifying Previous Order and Denying Rehearing'' the Commission clarified that the tariff
sheets which eliminated the Interruptible Revenue Crediting Mechanism could go into effect on September 1, 1994,
without refund condition and without being subject to a hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before August 31, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

Public Participation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public participation is open, ongoing, two-way communication, both formal and informal, between the Department
of Energy and its stakeholders. This steady, interactive communication enables each party to learn about and better
understand the views and positions of the other. The Department recognizes the many benefits to be derived from public
participation, for both stakeholders and DOE. Public participation provides a means for the Department to gather
the most diverse collection of opinions, perspectives, and values from the broadest spectrum of the public, enabling
the Department to make better, more informed decisions. Public participation benefits stakeholders by creating
an opportunity to provide input and influence decisions.

Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public participation is a fundamental component in program operations, planning activities, and decision-making
within the Department. The public is entitled to play a role in Departmental decision-making.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This policy is intended to ensure that public participation is an integral and effective part of Departmental activities
and that decisions are made with the benefit of important public perspectives. This policy provides a mechanism for
bringing a broad range of diverse stakeholder viewpoints and values early into the Department's decision-making
process. This early involvement enables the Department to make more informed decisions, improve quality through
collaborative efforts, and build mutual understanding and trust between the Department and the public it serves.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This policy is designed to function as a general framework within which all Department programs shall operate. While
it applies to all levels of DOE, its intent is development and implementation of effective public participation programs
at each site. In conjunction with its stakeholders and field manager, each site shall develop and implement a public
participation program that promotes openness and two-way communication and is tailored to meet specific program,
site, and stakeholder needs. This policy is not intended to affect legal requirements imposed by law, regulation,
or contractual agreement; neither does it modify any legal rights available to the public under current law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this policy, the Department actively seeks, considers, and incorporates or otherwise responds in a timely
manner to the views of its stakeholders thereby providing them an opportunity to influence decisions. Stakeholders
are defined as those individuals and groups in the public and private sectors who are interested in and/or affected
by the Department's activities and decisions. Public participation is defined as open, ongoing two-way communication,
both formal and informal, within the DOE Complex and between the Department and its stakeholders. This communication
will vary widely in nature and scope and may include, but is not limited to, informal conversations, scheduled meetings
and workshops, legally required hearings, and Federal-State-local-Tribal agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Goals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goals of the Department's Public Participation Policy are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. The Department actively seeks and considers public input, and incorporates or otherwise responds to the views
of its stakeholders in making its decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II. The public is informed in a timely manner about and empowered to participate in the Department's decision-making
processes, which are open, understandable, and consistently followed. Access points for public input are clearly
defined from the earliest stages of a decision process and provide adequate time for stakeholders to participate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. Credible, effective public participation processes are consistently incorporated into the Department's
program operations, planning activities, and decision-making processes, at headquarters and in the field. Every
employee within the DOE Complex shares responsibility to promote, practice, and improve public participation.

Accountability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Senior departmental, program, and field managers are accountable for assuring that public participation activities
meet the goals of this policy and the needs of stakeholders; are fully coordinated; and reflect Departmental principles
and values. Managers are responsible for implementing plans that assure that public participation needs for their
programs or projects are identified and satisfied in the decision-making process. Public Participation is a performance
element for these managers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Guidance On Implementation of the Department's Public Participation Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public participation must be a fundamental component of the Department's program operations, planning activities,
and decision-making. The business of the Department must be open to the full view and input of those whom it serves,
consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that we operate in this manner, the Department's Public Participation Policy was developed by a cross-cutting
team that included field representatives. This policy marks a clear break with past practice by challenging the Department
and its contractors to perform to a new standard of openness and service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Witin this policy framework, each site will develop its own public participation program and plan in consultation
with stakeholders and with the concurrence of appropriate Headquarters program offices. In achieving the goals
of public participation, managers are responsible for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;identifying, planning, funding, supporting, and implementing the appropriate level and scope of public
participation activities in their programs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;ensuring that public participation principles, values, and processes are fully understood and practiced
within their programs and at their sites;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;providing necessary human, information, systems, and financial resources; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;ensuring that their staff receive basic communication and public participation training, and where appropriate,
advanced public participation training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To promote teamwork, share the benefits of experience and innovation at individual sites, and avoid unreasonable
demands on site personnel or stakeholders, program and staff offices will coordinate public participation activities
through the Office of Public and Consumer Affairs at Headquarters or with its counterpart in the field. This coordination
in no way limits or dilutes field managers' authority to implement effective public participation programs or program
managers' responsibility to plan, fund, and support appropriate levels of public participation in their programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effectiveness with which each site/program implements the Department's Public Participation Policy will be
assessed annually, and these assessments must include the views and recommendations of stakeholders. Stakeholders
will also be invited to participate in the processes used to develop critieria and measures for judging effectiveness.
The Director of Public and Consumer Affairs will evaluate these annual assessments and recommend changes to improve
the effectiveness of the Department's public participation efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While public participation processes must be tailored to meet specific site, program, and stakeholder needs, the
following broad guidance provides a framework to assist management in implementing this policy Department-wide.
Using the following critical policy elements and implementing actions as a guide, Headquarters and Field Elements
should consult with stakeholders to develop appropriate public participation programs and activities.

Title:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Facility and Well Inventory Information for the UIC Program. (EPA ICR No:370.12) this ICR requests approval of an
amendment to an existing information collection activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will reinstate the ``Inventory of Injection Wells'' form which will be used by all 36 Primacy States and each of
the ten Regions to collect and maintain inventory information for each newly permitted and rule-authorized injection
well within its jurisdiction. Under Section 1445 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), persons subject to the Underground
Injection Control (UIC) program must: ``establish and maintain such records, make such reports, conduct such monitoring,
and provide such information as the Administrator may reasonably require by regulation to assist her in establishing
regulations under this title *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The specific UIC program requirements applicable to reinstating
the ``Inventory of Injection Wells'' form are codified at 40 CFR part 144_Underground Injection Control Program,
and 40 CFR part 145_State UIC Program Requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Inventory of Injection Wells information is entered on a one page form that has six areas of information: the first
five sections are concerned with facility identifier information such as name and location, facility ID number,
transaction type, geographical coordinates, and legal contact person. The sixth form area gathers information
on well class and type, number of wells and operational status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional and Headquarters' staff will use the inventory information collected from this form to make decisions on
resources and funding for State and Regional UIC programs, levels of enforcement activity, and strategic and policy
issues related to UIC program objectives. Primacy States (where primary enforcement responsibility is vested in
States that have EPA-approved UIC programs) will also use the injection well and facility information to target field
inspections and enforcement activity and to track well performance. In addition, Primacy States and Regions can
use the summary reports they supply to EPA Headquarters to evaluate their own program activities, such as the number
and operating characteristics of injection wells within their jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information on this form is completed by the Primacy State or the Region, using information available either from
inspection reports, the facility's permit file, or (in instances where the facility is rule authorized) from its
existing inventory file. The UIC well operator is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
required to submit any additional information as a result of this information collection request, and therefore,
will not incur any of the burden. The existing UIC Program ICR, which is approved by OMB through March, 1995, (OMB
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 2040&hyph;0042) includes the burden and cost incurred by well operators complying with 40 CFR 144.26 and applying
for either permits or rule-authorized status. This ICR under review details only the information and burden required
as a result of reinstating the ``Inventory of Injection Wells'' form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Burden Statement: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average approximately
one half hour per response per year. This includes time for reading the instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the needed data and completing the inventory form.

Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92&hyph;463), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
gives notices of the first meeting of the Good Neighbor Environmental Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Good Neighbor Environmental Board was created by the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative Act of 1992. An Executive
Order delegates implementing authority to the Administrator of EPA. The Board is responsible for providing advice
to the President and the Congress on the need for implementation of environmental and infrastructure projects within
the States contiguous to Mexico in order to improve the quality of life of persons residing on the United States side
of the border. The Board is required to submit an annual report to the President and the Congress. The statute calls
for the Board to have representatives from U.S. Government agencies; the governments of the States of Arizona, California,
New Mexico and Texas; and private organizations, including community development, academic, health, environmental,
and other nongovernmental entities with expertise on environmental and infrastructure problems along the southwest
border. The Board will meet at least twice annually.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 30 and July 1, 1993, EPA's Design for the Environment Program sponsored an international meeting entitled
``Workshop on Identifying a Framework for the Future of Human Health and Environmental Risk Ranking.'' The workshop
was organized by a committee of representatives from government, industry, academia, and environmental groups.
The workshop's goal was to bring together the possible users of a ranking system, as well as people who have been working
on developing such decision making tools. Through information sharing on systems needs and current status of system
development, the workshop participants sought to identify actions which need to be taken to develop a ranking system
that meets the needs of many potential users. With this notice, EPA is announcing the availability of a document entitled
``Proceedings Document: Workshop on Identifying a Framework for the Future of Human Health and Environmental Risk
Ranking,'' detailing the presentations and discussions from the EPA workshop.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its intention to accept and consider an application for the award
of a grant with time constraints to the American Drug Development, Inc. (ADD). The purpose of the grant is to provide
the orphan drug, Sodium Phenylbutyrate, to children with three urea cycle disorders (deficiencies of carbamyl phosphate
synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), and argininosuccinic acid synthetase) which, if not treated, are
fatal to the patient. Competition is limited to ADD because ADD is the entity currently able to manufacture and supply
Sodium Phenylbutyrate for the treatment of these disorders. ADD is also in the process of compiling documentation
which will be submitted to FDA for approval of a new drug application (NDA) for Sodium Phenylbutyrate. Until the NDA
is approved, this drug is not available to patients by any other means other than through a grant to ADD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is announcing its intention to accept and consider an application for the award of a grant with time constraints
to ADD, Baltimore, MD. FDA's authority to enter into grants for the development of drugs for rare diseases and conditions
is set out in Section 5 of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee). FDA's research program is described in the Catalog of
Federal Domestic Assistance No. 93.103. Before entering into grants, FDA carefully considers the benefits that
such grants will provide to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ADD's application will undergo a peer review in accordance with the Public Health Service policies and procedures
governing the review of grant applications with time constraints.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the past 8 years, FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development (OPD) has funded a clinical research grant for the
treatment of urea cycle disorders with Sodium Phenylbutyrate. This grant expires September 30, 1994. Due to the life-threatening
nature of urea cycle disorders, it is necessary to have a 3-month supply of the drug on hand in case possible problems
in the purity and/or availability of the drug arise. For this reason, more drugs must be ordered by September 15, 1994,
to ensure an adequate drug supply. ADD is able to immediately manufacture and supply the drug for the treatment of these
disorders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Mechanism of Support
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Award Instrument
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Support will be in the form of a grant. In 1994, the FDA estimate for this grant award is $ 750,000 (final amount will be
negotiated). The award will be subject to all policies and requirements that govern the research grant programs of
the Public Health Service (PHS), including the provision of 42 CFR part 52, 45 CFR part 74, and the PHS grants policy
statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Length of Support
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The length of support may be for 24 months with no possibility of additional noncompetitive support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Reasons for Award With Time Constraints
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA believes that there is a compelling need to award a grant to ADD based on time constraints because these urea cycle
disorders are fatal if untreated. Also, FDA believes that ADD is uniquely qualified to fulfill the objectives of the
proposed grant because it is able to immediately manufacture and supply Sodium Phenylbutyrate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Program progress reports and financial status reports will be required annually, based on the date of award. These
reports will be due within 30 days after the end of the budget period. A final program progress report and financial
status report will be due 90 days after expiration of the project period of the grant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Smoke-Free Workplace
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco
products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American
people.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Effexor

a patent term restoration application for Effexor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (U.S. Patent No. 4,535,186) from American Home Products Corp., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's
assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated April 22, 1994,
FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period
and that the approval of Effexor

Office requested that FDA determine the products's regulatory review period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Effexor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is 2,959 days. Of this time, 1,981 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 978
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: November 23, 1985. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that November 23, 1985, was the date the investigational
new drug application (IND) became effective. 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 April 26, 1991. The applicant claims June 18, 1991, as the date the new drug application (NDA) for Effexor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (NDA 20&hyph;151) was initially submitted. However, FDA records indicate that NDA 20&hyph;151 was initailly submitted
on April 26, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was approved
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: December 28, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20&hyph;151 was approved on December 28, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 5 years of patent term
extension. Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before October 31, 1994,
submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore,
any interested person may petition FDA, on or before February 27, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the
applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition
must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41&hyph;42,
1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Lipidil
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (fenofibrate). Lipidil

 is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with very high elevations of serum triglyceride
levels (Types IV and V hyperlipidemia) who are at risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined
dietary effort to control them. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term
restoration application for Lipidil
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (U.S. Patent No. 4,739,101) from Fournier Innovation et Synergie, and the Patent and Trademark Office requested
FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated April 19,
1994, FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period
and that the approval of Lipidil
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Lipidil
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is 4,501 days. Of this time, 1,003 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 3,498
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: September 6, 1981. The applicant claims August 16, 1981, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND)
became effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was September 6, 1981, which was 30 days
after FDA receipt of the IND.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: June 4, 1984. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that June 4, 1984, was the date the new drug application (NDA)
for Lipidil
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (NDA 19&hyph;304) was initially submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was approved
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: December 31, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 19&hyph;304 was approved on December 31, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 2 years and 256 days of
patent term extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before October 31, 1994, submit to the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Neurontin
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (gabapentin). Neurontin
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures with and without secondary generalization
in adults with epilepsy. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration
application for Neurontin
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (U.S. Patent No. 4,087,544) from Warner-Lambert Co., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance
in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated April 22, 1994, FDA advised
the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the
approval of Neurontin
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Neurontin
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is 2,740 days. Of this time, 2,040 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 700
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: July 2, 1986. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that July 2, 1986, was the date the investigational new drug application
(IND) became effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: January 31, 1992. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that January 31, 1992, was the date the new drug application
(NDA) for Neurontin
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (NDA 20&hyph;235) was initially submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was approved
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: December 30, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20&hyph;235 was approved on December 30, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 1,726 days of patent term
extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before October 31, 1994, submit to the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before March 22, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41&hyph;42, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.

Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (U.S. Patent No. 4,804,663) from Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's
assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated April 22, 1994,
FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period

FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Risperdal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->

days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
September 8, 1988. Applicant claims September 7, 1988, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND)
became effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was September 8, 1988, which was 30 days
after FDA receipt of the IND.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 683 days of patent term
extension. Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before October 31, 1994,
submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore,
any interested person may petition FDA, on or before February 27, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the
applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition
must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41&hyph;42,
1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The field of gene therapy is rapidly evolving. New approaches to genetic modification of somatic cells for the mitigation
of human disease are being developed in ever increasing numbers. The investigators who wish to pursue gene therapy
approaches are also increasing in number. FDA is interested in exploring with the public and industry means to overcome
impediments to the development of useful therapeutics for a variety of human diseases without diminishing patient
safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of this process, FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research is holding a public meeting to discuss
practical concerns relating to gene therapy vector production issues. The objectives of the meeting will be to: (1)
Solicit public testimony from biomedical researchers, university faculty members and administrators, biotechnology
associations, Federal and government agencies, and individuals and organizations with relevant information concerning
gene vector production experience; (2) solicit public testimony from the participants concerning potential barriers
to gene therapy vector product development and innovation, and the means to overcome these barriers; (3) discuss
quality control issues that have arisen for gene therapy vector products; and (4) discuss current good manufacturing
practices and good laboratory practices and their application to gene therapy vector production from the earliest
phases of the investigational new drug application process through the manufacture of licensed products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the participants mentioned above, patient and/or consumer organizations and other interested parties
are invited to participate in the meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information presented at the meeting will be considered by FDA in the development of future points to consider and
other guidance documents.

Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SDS program is a program of grants to health professions and nursing schools for the purpose of assisting such schools
in providing scholarships to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who are enrolled (or accepted for enrollment)
as full-time students in the schools, as well as to undergraduate students who have demonstrated a commitment to pursuing
a career in health professions.

Statutory Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The law requires that in providing SDS scholarships, the school give preference to students who are from disadvantaged
backgrounds and for whom the cost of attending an SDS school would constitute a severe financial hardship. Severe
financial hardship will be determined by the school in accordance with standard need analysis procedures prescribed
by the Department of Education for its Federal student aid programs.

Final Funding Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposed funding preference was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 20, 1994, at 59 FR 31643, for public comment. Three comments were received during the 30-day comment period
which were in support of the proposed funding preference. One commentor called attention to congressional report
language which directs the Department to give highest priority, among allied health applicants, to dental hygiene
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accord with the Congress' directive, the final funding preference will be revised as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For fiscal year 1994, among allied health schools or programs, preference will be given to the following baccalaureate
and graduate programs: dental hygiene, medical laboratory technology, occupational therapy, physical therapy
and radiologic technology. The priority for dental hygiene will be implemented by taking the total funds allocated
to the allied health disciplines in the initial allocation and recalculating this part of the allocation. Dental
hygiene schools will receive double credit for their disadvantaged enrollments in the reallocation of the allied
health funds.

Participants will be required to fulfill their contract service agreements through full-time clinical practice
at an Indian health program site determined by the Secretary. Loan repayment sites are characterized by physical,
cultural, and professional isolation, and have histories of frequent staff turnover. All Indian health program
sites are annually prioritized by discipline, based on need or vacancy by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All health professionals will receive up to $30,000 per year, regardless of their length of contract. Where payments
under the Loan Repayment Program result in an increase in Federal income tax liability, the IHS will pay up to 31 percent

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with this priority ranking, in determining which applications to approve and which contracts to accept,
the IHS will give priority to applications made by American Indians and Alaska Natives and to individuals recruited
through the efforts of Indian tribes or tribal or Indian organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;With respect to priorities among the various health professions, the statute requires that of the total amount
appropriated for Fiscal Year 1995 for loan repayment contracts, not less than 25 percent be provided to applicants
who are nurses, nurse practitioners, or nurse midwives and not less than 10 percent be provided to applicants who are
mental health professionals (other than nurses, nurse practitioners, or nurse midwives). This requirement does
not apply if the number of applications from these two groups, respectively, is not sufficient to meet the requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Subject to the above statutory priority for nurses and mental health practitioners, the IHS will give priority
in funding among health professionals to physicians in the following priority specialties: anesthesiology, emergency
room medicine, general surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology/otorhinolaryngology,
psychiatry and radiology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following factors are equal in weight when applied, and are applied when all other criteria are equal and a selection
must be made between applicants. One or all of the following factors may be applicable to an applicant, and the applicant
who has the most of these factors, all other criteria equal, would be selected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An applicant's length of current employment in the IHS, tribal or urban program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Availability for service earlier than other applicants (first come, first served); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Date the individual's application was received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any individual who enters this program and satisfactorily completes his or her obligated period of service may apply
to extend the contract on a year-by-year basis as determined by the IHS, at the maximum amount of up to $30,000 per year
and additional 31 percent for Federal Withholding. If funds are available, the maximum amount will be funded in this
manner and will not exceed the total of the individual's outstanding eligible health professions educational loans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any individual who owes an obligation for health professional service to the Federal Government or to a State or other
entity under an agreement with such State or other entity is not eligible for the Loan Repayment Program unless such
an obligation will be completely satisfied prior to the beginning of service under this program in the year that an
application is made for this program.

*&sect;It is important to note that applications are invited based on the funding levels proposed in the President's
budget for fiscal year 1995. However, this RFA is being announced prior to an appropriation of funds in order to allow
applicants sufficient time to establish collaboration and coordination and prepare applications. Solicitation
of applications in advance of an appropriation will also enable the award of appropriated grant funds in the most expeditious
manner and allow prompt implementation and evaluation of promising employment intervention programs for adults
with severe mental illnesses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
All applicants should understand, however, that final appropriation action will be necessary in order for CMHS to
fund any applications.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) announces the availability of demonstration grants to document the
effectiveness of programs designed to enhance competitive employment for adults with severe mental illnesses.
Funds will be awarded through the Community Support Program (CSP) of the Division of Demonstration Programs of CMHS.
This request for applications (RFA) solicits applications for two types of awards:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Demonstration Sites and a Coordinating Center.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This demonstration program addresses a priority mental health need: the enhancement of competitive employment
for adults with severe mental illnesses. A collaborative, multisite approach is essential to test the effectiveness
of different employment interventions and synthesize the intervention results. Because of the complexity of the
program, requiring substantial programmatic involvement of CMHS staff to facilitate communication and coordination
across projects, the cooperative agreement mechanism is being used.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The goal of this RFA is the generation of knowledge about effective approaches for enhancing competitive employment
for adults with severe mental illnesses through support for the implementation and evaluation of promising employment
intervention programs. Applications are being solicited for Demonstration Sites to conduct a multisite, cooperative
study of employment interventions to enhance competitive employment. Applications are also being sought for a Coordinating
Center to provide overall coordination and data management and to carry out the common protocol which will be developed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Target Population:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The population of concern for CSP grants includes individuals 18 years and older with severe mental illnesses (including,
but not limited to, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, mood disorders, and severe personality disorders)
that substantially interfere with a person's ability to carry out such primary aspects of daily living as self-care,
household management, interpersonal relationships, and work or school. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Statement of Issue:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rehabilitation is an essential component of care for adults with severe mental illnesses. In order to enhance independent
living as fully as possible, rehabilitation services need to include appropriate vocational rehabilitation, which
may include: assessment of potential for employment, training, job placement, continuing support, and reasonable
accommodations at the work site. In addition to providing remuneration and social contacts, employment may promote
improvements in self esteem, independence, community integration, and self-management of illness. People with
psychiatric disabilities are the second largest group of applicants for vocational rehabilitation services and
have the lowest rate of success. Even with high client motivation and the support of families, rates of employment
for this population are very low, ranging from 10 percent to 25 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special attention should be focused on persons from ethnic minority communities who are over-represented in the
adult severe mental illness population. With involvement of these community members at each stage of design, implementation
and evaluation, culturally competent interventions can be successful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Program Goal:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This demonstration program addresses a priority mental health need: competitive employment in integrated settings
for adults with severe mental illnesses. Competitive employment is defined as a paid position which is open to anyone
and pays at least minimum wages. Employment may include positions in a mental health system as long as the positions
are not restricted to adults with diagnoses of severe mental illnesses. On-site and/or off-site long-term supports
may be utilized. Because there is a need for systematically bringing together information concerning employment
intervention programs, CMHS is initiating this program to determine the effectiveness of interventions. Findings
concerning the most effective approaches and the associated direct costs are needed by policy makers and program
planners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This program of study is focussed on employment interventions which will lead to competitive employment. The goal
of the intervention, which may include vocational training and environmental accommodations, must be competitive
employment in mainstream (not sheltered) work environments. Outcome measures may include, but are not limited to,
days of paid employment within a specified time interval, level of social and occupational functioning, and consumer
and employer satisfaction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Effective employment interventions are an integral part of a community support system and, therefore, are expected
to be integrated with other services as appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goals of this program address the themes of the Secretary of HHS: fostering independence through empowering people
served; preventing future problems; and improving services to customers through modern management approaches.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Demonstration Site applicants will develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention with the goal of improving
competitive employment. This multisite, cooperative agreement will also develop a common study protocol. After
grantees are selected for funding, grantees and CMHS staff will identify issues and study questions which can be examined
by utilizing the data elements in common across the Demonstration Sites. The utilization of agreed-upon measures
which are in common across Demonstration Sites provides the opportunity to compare intervention effects for different
populations in different geographic locations, thereby enhancing the generalizability of results, and allows
for statistical analyses that assess the effects of multiple factors on employment status outcomes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Progress in employment is often characterized by episodes of productive employment followed by unemployment. Therefore,
a long-term perspective is needed to appropriately assess outcomes of an intervention. Successful applicants for
this program of study will include data collection over a period of at least 2 years, and a longer time interval for data
collection is encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary goal of this RFA is the determination of the effectiveness of interventions. However, information on
costs will be valuable in informing policy decisions for resource allocations. Effectiveness is defined as the improvement
of positive outcomes and the reduction of adverse outcomes, regardless of costs. An important component in studying
the value of an intervention is the determination of the costs of the intervention. Because this is an initial exploration
of costs, the focus will be limited to actual direct expenditures for employment intervention programs and employment
site activities. Costs unique to the evaluation component will not be included in the analyses. Cost information
from this demonstration program may provide the basis for future studies of cost effectiveness that would likely
be expanded to incorporate financial costs, indirect costs, and lost-opportunity costs.

Role of Demonstration Sites: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each Demonstration Site grantee, in collaboration with the Federal staff and the Coordinating Center, will have
responsibility at their own site for service program planning and implementation, client enrollment and follow
up, data collection, preliminary and final data analysis and interpretation, quality control, and preparation
of reports and publications. In addition, each Demonstration Site grantee will participate in the development and
activities of the common protocol including providing data to the Coordinating Center. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Role of the Coordinating Center: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the common protocol which will be developed in the planning phase, the Coordinating Center will provide overall
study coordination, including data management and analysis, training in common procedures, distribution of common
materials to all study sites, monitoring of data quality and analysis of cost data collected by the Demonstration
Sites. The Coordinating Center will also coordinate the pilot testing of the common core instruments, as agreed upon
in the planning phase. CMHS staff will work with and monitor the Coordinating Center. The Coordinating Center will
develop and maintain a common data repository, containing those data elements collected by each Demonstration Site
which will be used in the common protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Role of CMHS Staff: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CMHS staff will be active participants in all aspects of the cooperative agreements and will serve as collaborators
with project directors from the Demonstration Sites and the Coordinating Center. CMHS staff have overall responsibility
for monitoring the conduct and progress of this program and will make recommendations regarding continuance of the
program. CMHS staff will provide substantial input, in collaboration with the grantees, both in the planning and
conduct of this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Role of the Steering Committee: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Steering Committee will be composed of the project director of the Coordinating Center, the project directors
from each of the Demonstration Sites, and CMHS staff. In addition, for Demonstration Sites where the State mental
health authority is not the direct applicant, the State mental health authority will be invited to be a participant
as a voting member of the committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All participating grantees will agree to abide by the common protocol study design and policy recommendations developed
by the Steering Committee and any required CMHS approvals set forth in the terms and conditions of this cooperative
agreement.

Promoting Nonuse of Tobacco:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Studies have clearly established that the use of tobacco products increases mortality and morbidity, not only for
the primary users of these products but for those in close proximity to the user. Statistics published by the National
Cancer Institute indicate that cigarette smoking and chewing of tobacco are responsible for as many as 1,500 deaths
per day in the United States. Recent studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that prolonged
exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the probability of developing heart and lung disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with its mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people, it is the
policy of PHS to strongly encourage all recipients of the PHS grants to provide a smoke-free work place and promote
the nonuse of tobacco products. It is also the policy of PHS to encourage those recipients which already have a smoke-free
work place and promote the nonuse of tobacco products to continue such practices. Particular attention should be
given to avoiding exposure to secondary smoke by pregnant women and children. Additionally, CMHS strongly encourages
all cooperative agreement applicants to implement policies and activities that promote the nonuse of tobacco products
by clients/patients as a goal of treatment.

Review Process:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applications submitted in response to this RFA will be reviewed for technical merit in accordance with established
PHS/SAMHSA peer review procedures for grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications that are accepted for review will be assigned to an Initial Review Group (IRG) composed primarily of
non-Federal experts. Notification of the IRG's recommendation will be sent to the applicant upon completion of the
initial review. In addition, the IRG recommendations on technical merit of applications will undergo a second level
of review by the appropriate advisory council whose review may be based on policy considerations as well as technical
merit. Applications may be considered for funding only if the advisory council concurs with the IRG's recommendation
for approval.

Review Criteria for Demonstration Site Applications: The points noted in the parentheses for each criterion indicate
the maximum number of points the reviewers may assign to that criterion. These points will be used to calculate a raw
score for each application. The raw score will be converted to the official priority score.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Current OHV use designations for public lands in the area, established in the Little Snake Resource Area Resource
Management Plan, 1989, allow motorized vehicle use on and off the roads and trails year round. State and local agencies
and neighboring landowners expressed concerns that the new Colorado Division of Wildlife's Grieve Conservation
Easement would open the Fly Creek area to motorized traffic (consistent with the current RMP travel management designation)
and cause unacceptable impacts to natural resources, especially wildlife and soils.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The affected public lands include identified soil erosion hazard and important high quality big game habitat. The
public lands are neighbored by private lands and in many places the boundaries are not marked or otherwise identified,
thus creating potential trespass situations. The area also contains several grazing allotments which at times require
motorized vehicle access by the permittee for maintenance of range facilities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given due consideration of the concerns expressed by the public and the potential impacts of unrestricted motorized
vehicle use, a modification of existing OHV use designations is necessary to adequately protect natural resources
on public land, minimize conflicts with other uses, prevent trespass problems, and ensure public safety until the
off-highway vehicle management portion of the little Snake Resource Area Resource Management Plan is reviewed and
if necessary modified. Provisions will be made to allow for necessary motorized travel on the public lands for administrative
purposes and to facilitate non-motorized public access, snowmobiles and travel on designated routes on public lands
in the Fly Creek area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public information, including detailed maps of the restricted area, roads and trails will be posted at the access
sites and available in the Resource Area Office and District Office at the addresses shown below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who are exempt from the restrictions contained in this notice include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Any Federal, State, or local officers engaged in fire, emergency and law enforcement activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. BLM employees engaged in official duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Persons or agencies holding a valid permit or right-of-way on or across the restricted public land for access to
private land, for purposes related to the access of private land on said easement only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Persons or agencies holding a special use permit or right-of-way accessing public lands for purposes consistent
with the permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Grazing permittees authorized during the permitted grazing season for grazing related purposes provided such
motorized use is limited to existing roads and trails and subject to any additional conditions in the grazing permit.
Any motorized use before or after the permitted grazing season necessary for maintenance and operation of range facilities
shall require advance approval by the authorized officer specifically authorizing such use and subject to whatever
restrictions are deemed necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR 50.7, and 42 U.S.C. 6973(d), notice is hereby given that on August 24,
1994, a proposed joint stipulation of settlement in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dale Valentine, et al.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Civil Action No. 93CV1005J, was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint filed by the United States on February 19, 1993, seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties under Section
7003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA''), 42 U.S.C. 6973. The complaint alleges that an abandoned
oil reprocessing facility near Glenrock, Wyoming, commonly known as Powder River Crude Processors or Big Muddy Oil
Processors (the ``Site''), may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment.
The complaint seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties for violations of administrative orders issued by EPA
under Section 7003 of RCRA for a cleanup of the Site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the stipulation, one of the ten defendants named in the action, Richard Wallace, will pay a civil penalty of $30,000
to the United States for violations of the administrative order issued by EPA to him on October 3, 1991. The stipulation
provides that the penalty claim alleged in the Complaint will be dismissed with prejudice, and all other claims alleged
in the Complaint, which include the claims for injunctive relief, will be dismissed without prejudice. This settlement
is based in part on information provided to the United States by Defendant Wallace indicating that his financial ability
to pay a civil penalty is limited. Five other defendants in this action are performing work pursuant to a consent decree
entered by the Court on June 21, 1994, designed to address conditions at the Site which may present an imminent and substantial
endangerment to health or the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed stipulation of settlement. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General
of the Environment and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, P.O. Box 7611, Ben Franklin Station, Washington,
DC 20044, and should refer to

Agency, Region 8, 999 18th Street_Suite 500, Denver, Colo. 80202&hyph;2466; and at the Consent Decree Library, 1120
``G'' Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, (202) 624&hyph;0892. A copy of the proposed stipulation may be

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Civil Action No. 94&hyph;5522. The Complaint in this case alleged that California SunCare, Inc. engaged in a combination

products that provides that: (1) defendant will sell only to a dealer that prices at or above defendant's suggested
resale price, and/or (2) defendant will terminate any dealer for pricing below defendant's suggested resale price.
Finally, the defendant is also enjoined for a period of five years from the date of entry of the final judgment from (1)
threatening any dealer with termination or terminating any dealer for pricing below the defendant's suggested resale
price, and (2) discussing with any present or potential dealer any decision regarding termination of any other dealer

Dear California SunCare Dealer:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice filed a civil suit alleging that from November 1992,
through April 1994, California SunCare, Inc. (``California SunCare'') entered into agreements with certain dealers
to fix and maintain the resale prices of California SunCare products. California SunCare has agreed, without admitting
any violation of the law and without being subject to any monetary penalties, to the entry of a civil Consent Order prohibiting
certain pricing practices in the United States, including for a period of five years prohibiting California SunCare
from announcing to the public or to any dealer that California SunCare has a resale pricing policy that contains any
provision that provides that: (a) California SunCare will sell only to a dealer that prices at or above California
SunCare's suggested resale price, and/or (2) California SunCare will terminate any dealer for pricing below California
SunCare's suggested resale price. A copy of the Order is enclosed.

Nature And Purpose Of The Proceeding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 12, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint under Section 4 of the Sherman Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C. &sect;4, alleging that the defendant California SunCare, Inc. (``California SunCare'') engaged in a combination
and conspiracy, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;1, to fix the price of indoor tanning products
sold by California SunCare to dealers throughout the United States. The complaint alleges that, in furtherance of
this conspiracy, California SunCare:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) established and communicated to dealers a minimum resale price for indoor tanning products from California SunCare;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) obtained agreements from dealers to maintain the minimum price as a condition of receiving and continuing to receive
indoor tanning products from California SunCare.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint also alleges that as a result of the combination and conspiracy, prices of indoor tanning products have
been fixed and maintained, and competition in sales of indoor tanning products has been restrained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that the combination and conspiracy is illegal, and seeks to enjoin California SunCare from
continuing or renewing the alleged combination or conspiracy and from engaging in any combination or conspiracy
or adopting any practice or plan having a similar purpose or effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States and California SunCare have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance
with the APPA, unless the United States withdraws its consent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court's entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate the action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction
over the matter for possible further proceedings to construe, modify or enforce the Judgment, or to punish violations
of any of its provisions.

Description Of Practices Giving Rise To The Alleged Violation Of The Antitrust Laws
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
California SunCare, a California corporation, is a leading seller of indoor tanning products in the United States.
Indoor tanning products sold by California SunCare are manufactured in California by California SunCare. California
SunCare sells indoor tanning products to dealers which sell them to indoor tanning salons, which in turn sell them
to consumers. Each year, California SunCare publishes a resale price schedule stating the price at which California
SunCare believes its products should be resold by dealers to salons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the period from November 1992 through April 1994, California SunCare confronted several dealers who were
selling California SunCare products at a discount. The discounts included new customer discounts, discounts for
trade association members, and free product after a certain number of bonus points had been earned on previous purchases.
California SunCare obtained agreements from these dealers to maintain California SunCare's announced resale prices
on indoor tanning products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In April, 1994, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice began an investigation into California SunCare's
pricing policy.

Explanation Of The Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The parties have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court at any time after compliance
with the APPA. The proposed Final Judgment states that it shall not constitute an admission by either party with respect
to any issue of fact or law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Final Judgment enjoins any direct or indirect continuation or renewal of the type of conspiracy alleged
in the complaint. Specifically, Section IV enjoins and restrains the defendant from entering into, adhering to,
maintaining, furthering, enforcing or claiming any right under any contract, agreement, understanding, plan or
program with any dealer to fix, stabilize, or maintain the resale prices at which indoor tanning products sold or distributed
by the defendant may be sold or offered for sale in the United States by any dealer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Final Judgment not only bars California SunCare's Unlawful practices, but also contains additional
provisions that are remedial in nature. Section IV provides that the defendant is prohibited for five years from announcing
to the public or to any present or potential dealer of its indoor tanning products that defendant has or is adopting,
promulgating, suggesting, announcing or establishing any resale pricing policy for indoor tanning products that
provides that: (1) defendant will sell only to a dealer that prices at or above defendant's suggested resale price,
and/or (2) defendant will terminate any dealer for pricing below defendant's suggested resale price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the defendant is prohibited for a period of five years from the date of entry of the final judgment from
(1) threatening any dealer with termination or terminating any dealer for pricing below the defendant's suggested
resale price, and (2) discussing with any present or potential dealer any decision regarding termination of any other
dealer for any reason directly or indirectly related to the latter dealer's pricing below defendant's suggested
resale price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section V of the proposed Final Judgment is designed to ensure that California SunCare's dealers are aware of the limitations
imposed on it by the Final Judgment. Section V requires the defendant to send notices and copies of the Judgment to each
dealer who purchased indoor tanning products from the defendant in 1992, 1993 or 1994. In addition, the defendant
is required to send notices and copies of the Judgment to every other dealer who purchases indoor tanning products
from California SunCare within ten years of the date of entry of the proposed Final Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section VI requires the defendant to set up an antitrust compliance program. The defendant is also required to furnish
a copy of the Judgment to each of its officers and directors and each of its non-clerical employees, representatives,
or agents with supervisory or direct responsibility for the sale or advertising of indoor tanning products in the
United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed Final Judgment provides methods for determining and securing the defendant's compliance
with its terms. Section VIII provides that, upon request of the Department of Justice, the defendant shall submit
written reports, under oath, with respect to any of the matters contained in the Judgment. Additionally, the Department
of Justice is permitted to inspect and copy all books and records and to interview officers, directors, employees
and agents of the defendant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IX makes the Judgment effective for ten years from the date of its entry.

Section XI of the proposed Final Judgment states that entry of the Judgment is in the public interest. Under the provisions
of the APPA, entry of the proposed Final Judgment is conditional upon a determination by the Court that the proposed
Final Judgment is in the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Government believes that the proposed Final Judgment is fully adequate to prevent the continuation or recurrence
of the violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act alleged in the Complaint, and that disposition of this proceeding without
further litigation is appropriate and in the public interest.

Comments Relating to Proposed Final Judgment and Response of United States to Comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(b)&hyph;(h), the
United States hereby files comments it has received relating to the proposed Final Judgment in this civil antitrust
proceeding, and herein responds to those comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action commenced on April 21, 1994, when the United States filed a Complaint alleging that an anticompetitive
practice of defendant Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (``EPS'') constituted a tying arrangement that was per
se unlawful under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;1, and that constituted a means whereby EPS unlawfully
had maintained a monopoly in access to regional automatic teller machine (``ATM'') networks in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania and the States of New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia and New Hampshire, and in substantial portions
of the State of Ohio (collectively the ``affected states''), all in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.
&sect;2. The United States simultaneously filed a proposed Final Judgment, a Competitive Impact Statement and a
Stipulation signed by the parties consenting to entry of the Final Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sixty-day waiting period provided for by 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(b) for submission of public comments expired on July
11, 1994. The United States received comments from Cash Station, Inc. (``Cash Station''), Chemical Banking Corporation
(``Chemical Bank''), Citicorp Credit Services, Inc. (``Citicorp''), William R. Kennedy, Meridian Bancorp, Inc.
(``Meridian''), Midwest Payment Systems, Inc. (``MPS''), Money Station, Inc. (``Money Station''), and The New
York Switch Corporation (``NYCE''). The United States also received an anonymous comment. The United States responds
herein to these comments.

I. Stored Value Cards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subject raised most often by the comments was the treatment of stored value cards under the proposed Final Judgment.
Stored value cards are designed to accept a ``deposit'' of funds, which are then drawn down by transfer to other parties
in transactions. The card effectively replaces cash in these transactions. The most common use of stored value cards
today is in public transit, most notably in the Bay Area Rapid Transit system in the San Francisco area and the Washington,
DC Metro system. Rather than paying separately for each ride, a customer purchases a card for a certain amount, that
amount is ``deposited in'' the card, and the cost of each subsequent ride is deducted from the value in the card. The
passenger may add value to the card with additional ``deposits.'' Libraries also commonly sell stored valued cards
for use in their copying machines.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The banking industry expects that stored value cards will be used in many other types of transactions in the foreseeable
future. Pilot projects are under way for use of stored value cards with merchants, in vending machines, and at laundromats.
While the stored value cards in use today are often paper with a magnetic stripe, these cards are generally expected
to be made of more durable material and function through an internal integrated circuit, or ``chip,'' and are often
referred to as ``smart cards.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments dealing with this subject suggested that EPS could unlawfully maintain its monopoly in access to regional
ATM networks, or extend its geographic scope, through regulations on the stored value feature of hybrid ATM/stored
value cards issued by members of its ATM network.These commenters suggested that the proposed Final Judgment could
contain various restrictions on the ability of EPS to issue such regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Citicorp suggested that the defendant could block entry of competing smart card networks by imposing technical restrictions
(presumably covering communications format, hardware or software) on MAC members that create incompatibilities
between their ATMs and non-MAC smart cards. Citicorp notes that EPS currently uses a smart card technology different
from some competing smart cards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A similar situation could have, but did not, arise with respect to ATM cards when they were introduced in the 1970s.
There is no inherent reason to believe that such a situation will arise with respect to smart cards. While Citicorp's
observations may be correct, detailed regulation of smart card operations and technology is not necessary or possible
at the present time. As discussed below, if anticompetitive practices develop as smart cards are introduced, action
can be taken at the appropriate time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section IV.H of the proposed Final Judgment prohibits EPS from restricting the branding of ATMs with the marks of networks
in addition to MAC, and likewise enjoins EPS from restricting the branding of ATM cards with the marks of multiple networks
by banks in certain states. A later clause in Section IV.H provides that, ``notwithstanding the preceding, Defendant
*&blank;*&blank;* may restrict the branding of access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with
a stored value function.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect of this clause is to exclude the branding of the stored value function from the injunction against restrictions
on multiple branding of cards. EPS may, within the limits of antitrust and other applicable laws, restrict the branding
of ``stand-alone'' stored value cards (cards having no ATM functions) and the stored value function of ``hybrid''
ATM/stored value cards. EPS may not, however, restrict the branding of stand-alone ATM cards or the ATM functions
of hybrid cards, nor may EPS defeat the injunction against restrictions on dual branding by converting ATM functions
to integrated circuit technology.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The clause is necessary since in its absence paragraph IV.H could be interpreted to enjoin EPS from restricting the
branding of both the stored value function and the ATM functions of hybrid cards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of the proposed Final Judgment, it is irrelevant whether the ATM functions in a card are carried out by
a magnetic stripe or an integrated circuit. The obligations of EPS are not affected by the method of ATM access. The
clause permitting restrictions on the branding of stored value functions is limited to chip-based stored value functions
because that was the limit of the exception EPS sought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any other construction would lead to results not intended by the proposed Final Judgment. As discussed in the Competitive
Impact Statement, the goal of Paragraph IV.H of the proposed Final Judgment is to ensure that MAC member depository
institutions can participate in non-MAC ATM networks in practice as well as in theory. To that end, EPS must permit
a member's ATM cards to function in the other networks in which that member participates; EPS cannot block these cards
from functioning in multiple networks. In general, cardholders are aware of such multiple network functionality
primarily because their ATM cards carry the brands of the relevant networks. If the clause were interpreted to allow
EPS to restrict the branding of both the stored value and the ATM features of hybrid ATM/stored value cards, the result
would be that these hybrid cards would function as ATM cards in another network (as required by the proposed Final Judgment)
but would carry no brand for that network. Cardholders would thus be unaware of their ability to access this network,
and would not use the card for that purpose. This result_cards with ``hidden'' functionalty_was not intended by either
party to the proposed Final Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States is not aware of any current multiple branding restrictions on stand-alone stored value cards or
the stored value function of hybrid ATM/stored value cards in the MAC network. Nothing in the proposed Final Judgment,
or any other document filed by the United States in this action, should be interpreted as evidencing a conclusion by
the United States that such restrictions would or would not be a violation of the antitrust laws. Contrary to the observation
in a comment filed by Chemical Bank, the proposed Final Judgment does not give EPS the ``right'' to issue such regulations;
rather, EPS continues to be bound by the antitrust laws and any other applicable laws. If such regulations are issued
and prove to be an antitrust violation, they can and would be challenged at the appropriate time.

II. POS Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments filed by MPS, Money Station and an anonymous source argued that the proposed Final Judgment should apply
to access to point-of-sale (``POS'') network services as well as access to regional ATM network services.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 As previously noted, the investigation conducted by the United States concluded that EPS had unlawfully maintained
a monopoly in access to regional ATM network services in certain geographic areas. It did not determine whether EPS
had market power in POS services, or whether the conduct of EPS in relation to its POS network business constituted
an antitrust violation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
POS terminals are generally located in the establishments of merchants. They accept an ATM card and, using the ATM
network or a parallel POS-only network, access the cardholder's account to transfer funds to the merchant's account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained more fully in the Complaint and Competitive Impact Statement, MAC has maintained its monopoly in access
to regional ATM network services in part by preventing the use of third party processors by its member depository institutions.
It is the understanding of the United States that EPS does not forbid the use of third party processors in its POS network.
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, although the comments noted that EPS was a significant supplier of POS network services and suggested that
it might exercise its strength in this area to maintain its monopoly in access to ATM network services, none of the comments
indicated that EPS was taking any action of this type.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Nevertheless, the proposed Final Judgment does not, as argued by Money Station, leave EPS ``free'' to place restrictions
on the use of POS services by MAC members. Rather, EPS is bound by the antitrust laws and other applicable laws. If the
conduct of EPS in the provision of POS network services constitutes an antitrust violation, it can and would be challenged
at the appropriate time.

MPS compared the fees charged by EPS to and for the use of third party processors in its POS network with the cap set by
the proposed Final Judgment on fees to and for the use of third party processors in its ATM network. While the comment
noted that fees were higher in the POS network, this in and of itself does not establish that third party processors
are unable to operate in the POS network, nor does it establish that EPS has monopoly power in access to POS network services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Money Station noted that EPS could conceivably forbid MAC members to join other POS networks, or that it could forbid
the use of third party POS processors by its members. While such conduct could constitute an antitrust violation,
there is no allegation that EPS has taken such action. The United States is not prepared to speculate as to whether EPS
will issue regulations on the use of POS network or processing services by its members, nor upon the content of any such
regulations. Such regulations can be challenged if and when they are instituted.

III. Voidability of Contracts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cash Station expressed concern that the proposed Final Judgment does not make clear that ATM processing and authorization
processing contracts between EPS and its members are voidable by the members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph IV.A of the proposed Final Judgment states in relevant part:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Defendent shall not maintain or enforce any *&blank;*&blank;* contract *&blank;*&blank;* pursuant to which defendant
requires any depository institution to obtain ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant; that
prohibits or purports to prohibit a depository institution from obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing
from any third party processor; or that conditions MAC membership or availability of MAC or any successor branded
ATM network access on any depository institution's obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant
or not obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from a qualified third party processor.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision makes void any contracts containing such clauses. Paragraph IV.I of the proposed Final Judgment permits
EPS to enter into new contracts with any customers, including those whose contracts have become void under the terms
of Paragraph IV.A, provided that it supplies a copy of the Final Judgment to those customers and the new contracts conform
to the terms of the Final Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cash Station also expressed concern that unless EPS were required to explicitly notify those customers whose contracts
were voided by the proposed Final Judgment it would continue to reap the benefits of these contracts until they expired.
Notification is provided for in the proposed Final Judgment, which requires EPS to provide a copy of the Final Judgment
to all of its customers. In addition, third party processors and competing regional ATM networks will be highly likely
to bring this fact to the attention of potential customers.

IV. Gateways
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MPS suggested that the proposed Final Judgment should require EPS to establish ``gateways'' with other regional
ATM networks.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The United States considered this issue in the course of its investigation and concluded that ensuring that MAC members
would be permitted to use third party processors would be a simpler and more efficient type of injunctive relief to
remove the barriers to entry of competing networks, since access to other networks will be offered by these third party
processors.

A gateway between two regional ATM networks is essentially a short-cut to avoid the use of a national ATM network and
its relatively high fees. Often today a cardholder of one network can conduct transactions on the ATMs of another network.
In most cases such a transaction would be routed to the cardholder's depository institution over a national ATM network
linking the two regional ATM networks. With a gateway, however the transaction is routed directly from the network
of the ATM deployer to the network of the card issuer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An anonymous comment stated that the proposed Final Judgment did not clearly apply to ATM deployers other than depository
institutions. Paragraph II.H clearly states that ``depository institution'' for purposes of the proposed Final
Judgment includes all MAC members who deploy ATMs. The proposed Final Judgment therefore applies to all MAC members,
whether or not depository institutions.

VI. Technical, Financial and Operating Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph IV.E of the proposed Final Judgment requires EPS to provide qualified third party processors access to
the MAC network. Because a ``qualified'' third party processor is defined in part as one which meets the defendant's
existing technical, financial and operating criteria for intercept processors and third party processors, an anonymous
comment argued that the United States should undertake a comprehensive review of the existing criteria and each change
to the criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms of the proposed Final Judgment render such a detailed review unnecessary. The paragraph in question makes
clear that these criteria are the same for both third party processors and intercept processors.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 As discussed in the Competitive Impact Statement, the United States has concluded that EPS has a strong incentive
to deal fairly with its intercept processors, and requiring equal treatment of third party processors and intercept
processors should therefore assure that third party processors are also dealt with fairly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While a subsequent clause allows EPS to establish additional technical criteria for third party processors, the
clause states that additional technical criteria may only concern the transaction information to be transmitted
and the communication and data format. Moreover, the additional criteria may not discriminate between third party
processors and intercept processors.

The comment lists several possible methods by which third party processors could be treated unfairly by EPS, such
as delays in the payment of moneys owed, unnecessary mandatory training sessions, and late notification of network
technical changes. Because the proposed Final Judgment requires that third party processors and intercept processors
have equal access to the network, any such discriminatory treatment would violate the proposed Final Judgment. Additional
restrictions are unnecessary.

VII. Pricing Structure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An anonymous comment discussed the EPS pricing structure for third party processors and suggested several changes
to that structure for incorporation into the Final Judgment. One section of this comment alleged that EPS rules require
third party processors seeking access to the MAC network to be ``sponsored'' by a MAC member depository institution,
and that the third party processor is often charged a fee by the MAC member for this sponsorship. Such a sponsorship
requirement would violate paragraph IV.E of the proposed Final Judgment, which requires that third party processors
be offered access to the MAC network equal in type and quality to that offered to intercept processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment also stated that the charge paid by third party processors in most ATM networks consists of a combination
of a charge from the network and a charge from the card-issuing bank, and that this latter charge is paid by the network
to the card-issuing bank.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The comment alleged that this ``bundling'' of fees is anticompetitive, apparently arguing that this conduct constitutes
a tying violation. However, a traditional element of tying violations is that the products are actually separate;
in other words, that they can be or have been bought or sold separately. The comment itself suggests that all ATM networks
currently charge in this manner. Moreover, to the knowledge of the United States, EPS is not currently engaged in such
conduct since, as discussed in the Complaint and Competitive Impact Statement, EPS essentially has no third party
processors in its network. If EPS chooses to institute such a pricing policy it can then be determined if the policy
violates the proposed Final Judgment or antitrust laws.

The United States is not at all certain that this is the case. It is the understanding of the United States that in most
ATM networks a transaction that reaches the network switch through the third party processor of the bank acquiring
the transaction results only in a charge for use of the network. The only other charge associated with the transaction
is an ``exchange revenue'' charge which is paid by the card-issuing bank to the transaction-acquiring bank. In essence,
this is a charge for use of the acquiring bank's ATM terminal by the cardholder of the card-issuing bank.

Finally, the comment argues that the proposed Final Judgment should order EPS to distribute MAC price lists as a method
of ``policing'' the non-discrimination clause. However, there is no reason to believe either that EPS will violate
the proposed Final Judgment by offering discriminatory pricing or that it would be able to keep such a blatant violation
confidential. In addition, the proposed Final Judgment permits the United States to issue inquiries to EPS which
would easily determine its pricing arrangements. It is therefore not necessary to order publication of price lists.

VIII. Subswitching
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Money Station argued that by permitting EPS to charge for subswitching of transactions, the proposed Final Judgment
interferes with the ability of third party processors to access the network. ``Subswitching'' refers to the switching
of transactions between members of the same regional network without accessing that network, and therefore without
paying its switch fees. Generally this is done by passing the transaction through a third party processor that provides
ATM processing for both members. Many regional ATM networks, although not all, have rules against subswitching.
These networks argue that cardholders, who make the ultimate decision about which ATM to access, choose a particular
ATM based upon their expectation that the transaction will be routed over a common regional ATM network, known to the
cardholder by the brand logo on the ATM and the card. Permitting subswitching in this view merely allows third party
processors to ``free ride'' on the advertising efforts of the common network.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph IV.G.2 of the proposed Final Judgment permits EPS to charge a royalty on subswitching equal to the price
EPS would charge for a switched transaction. As Money Station notes, this would likely discourage subswitching since
the third party processor would also charge a fee for its services. Nevertheless, this will not discourage entry by
third party processors. As described in the Complaint, third party processors have not been successful in entering
MAC's geographic region because MAC members have been unable to purchase their ATM processing services. The proposed
Final Judgment ensures that MAC members will be able to use third party processors. Inability to offer subswitching
does not appear to be a substantial barrier to entry. Moreover, third party processors wishing to offer the ability
to switch transactions can simply become a network by ``branding'' their services; in other words, putting their
brand logos on cards and ATMs. The third party processor would then become a competing regional ATM network to which
EPS, according to paragraph IV.H of the proposed Final Judgment, may not restrict access.

IX. Definition of ``Restrict''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Money Station suggests that the term ``restrict'' as used in paragraph IV.H and certain other clauses of the proposed
Final Judgment is not sufficiently defined. It was not necessary to define this term since the phrase used was ``restrict
in any manner.'' This broad prohibition on restrictions is all that is necessary; if any restriction is imposed, it
will violate the proposed Final Judgment.

Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(e), the proposed Final Judgment cannot be entered unless the Court determines that
it is in the public interest. The focus of this determination is whether the relief provided by the proposed Final Judgment
is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint.

When a shared network obtains market dominance, it can preclude use of it by other parties (financial institutions
or third party processors) by explicit exclusions or by more insidious means, generally pricing. These issues are
clearly recognized by the proposed Final Judgment, and language in section IV establishes what the ``prohibited
conduct'' would be on the part of MAC. The judgment goes on to say that MAC ``shall not restrict in any manner, directly
or indirectly, the ability.&blank;.&blank;.to obtain ATM processing or authorization for access to the MAC or any
successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant from any qualified third party processor.'' Generally, equal
access shall be provided to qualified third party processors on equal terms as those extended to intercept processors,
including aggregation of transactions. Reciprocity of processing, including pricing and terms, is also contemplated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defendant is also ordered to offer volume discounts to all, on substantially equal terms, and the judgment also permits
MAC to offer transaction switching at nondiscriminatory royalties that shall not be greater than the price for switched
transactions. This last stipulation may need a bit of clarification for the Final Judgment to have its intended effect,
however, and that is the substance of this comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banks and other financial institutions have ``joined forces'' in many, widely different combinations to offer electronic
banking services to their customers since the advent of ATM's and other electronic terminals. Generally speaking,
these combinations are formed for (1) marketing purposes, (2) particular geographic areas, (3) brand identification
that differentiates services available to particular sets of customers, and (4) cost efficiencies that result from
larger transaction bases (economies of scale). Whatever the reason, there now exists a diverse tapestry of electronic
banking associations across the United States, but in some areas, a monopolistic enterprise threatens the existence
of many smaller networks. Such is the case with MAC and its ATM network.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Open access is available, but only from a technological point of view. Financial institutions and third party processors
are essentially forced to join the dominant network to provide the greatest access possible to retail customers.
There would be no problem if the dominant network would change only for transactions (without surcharge or royalty)
based on volume of transactions presented. Then the user of the subordinate network would be paying for the marketing
benefits of its smaller network and only for the use of the ``electronic highway'' provided by the dominant network.
In fact, the brand identity of the dominant network serves no purpose to an otherwise ``unbranded'' user. Moreover,
no one would argue that the choice to join MAC should be made by weighing the advantages of its brand (with all the consequent
marketing and service differentials) against an alternative brand, but MAC's current pricing structure places
a punitive burden on third party processors and financial institutions and forces membership in the network, requiring
MAC identification, thus hastening the demise of subordinate networks and eliminating choice between different
providers of service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Just recently the Quest Network of Kentucky sent a letter to its participants indicating that its viability had been
re-assessed, with the outcome that the Quest brand would be discontinued in favor of MAC by June 1, 1995 (letter attached).
The only reason for this change was the layering of pricing to participants in the Quest Network caused by the brand
identity of MAC on its members who were also members of the Quest Network.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A simple solution to this issue would be the ability of subordinate networks to use the dominant network for transaction
switching, paying a competitive and nondiscriminatory price for that use, but without the requirement of brand identification
(and subsequent terms and pricing) of membership in the dominant network. Reciprocity should also be a requirement,
such that if the dominant network desired the ability to use the subordinate network's transaction switching service,
it, too, would have to provide full, complete and nondiscriminatory access to its network without mandating membership
and brand identity by the dominant network members. In essence, ``open access'' should be the rule without ``branding''
each network with the other's identity in an area where there is clear dominance by one network over others. This is
the case in Illinois where four (4) networks act cooperatively to permit universal access to any cardholder in that
state without requiring any one network member (or third party processor) to join any other network. Pricing is based
solely upon the number of transactions processed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concept of ``ubiquity and convenience'' can only be accomplished by a truly open environment where individual
institutions, processors or networks can have access to the dominant electronic banking network, which in this case
is MAC, and where MAC members can enjoy the same reciprocity at the subordinate network terminals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not clear what effect the proposed Final Judgment will have on point of sale (POS) services. Although MAC may or
may not be practicing the exact same ``anti-competitive'' conduct in the POS area as in the ATM area, certain barriers
do exist which discourage competition. For example, although MAC seems to allow member financial institutions to
use third party processors to provide POS services to such financial institution's sponsored merchants, the costs
of such an option are prohibitive. MAC charges a $25,000 ``Processor Initialization Fee'' to such a third party processor
(MAC Point of Sale Schedule of Fees attached). The MAC Point of Sale Schedule of Fees states that this fee is for test
time and certification, but the $25,000 only includes 20 hours of test time and there is a charge of $250 per hour for
test time which exceeds the 20 hours. This set-up or establishment fee is plainly excessive in relation to the $100
per hour, $1,000 maximum third party processor set-up fee set forth in the proposed Final Judgment. In addition, MAC
charges third party POS processors $1,000 per month for the first communications port, $2,000 per month for each additional
communications port and a $300 per month ``Processor Residency Fee''. Given the importance and dramatic rise in POS
transactions over the years, failure to explicitly include POS antitrust stipulations in the proposed Final Judgment
could have a devastating effect on competition in the POS area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, there is a curious exclusion of ``access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored
value function'' from branding restrictions in Section IV(H). If these cards should be issued by a MAC member, and
their use might include the necessity to utilize transaction switching services of MAC from a terminal other than
a MAC terminal, should they not also be included in the philosophy that says there can be no brand restriction by MAC?
It is recognized that use of these unique types of cards may involve ``off-line'' transactions throughout some period,
but the settlement and switching of settlement transactions may necessitate the same unrestricted access to the
network that magnetically striped cards would employ in an ``on-line'' mode. As an example, if a cardholder in an ``electronic
benefits'' (EBT) processing area that utilizes ``smart card'' technology is able to withdraw a certain amount of
cash from ATM's as part of the benefit distribution process, and that cardholder uses an ATM belonging to a network
or processed by a third party processor other than MAC, the network or processor should be able to switch settlement
transactions through MAC (paying the standard switching fee) without paying an excessive royalty or finding it necessary
to become a member of MAC in order to complete the transaction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 -->
Date: June 22, 1994
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From: Mike McEvoy, President, Transaction Services Company
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
On May 10, 1993, the Quest Network sent a memorandum to your organization that outlined our commitment to continue
providing Quest-branded services to financial institutions throughout this market area. Since that communication
a year ago, several major announcements and changes have occurred which has resulted in a re-assessment of the ongoing
viability of the Quest Network and the services offered under the Quest brand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (EPS) is a Delaware corporation currently owned by four bank holding companies:
Banc One Corporation, Columbus, Ohio; CoreStates Financial Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; KeyCorp,
Albany, New York (successor to Society Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio); and PNC Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
These four bank holding companies have consolidated their various ATM/POS networks (MAC, Owl, Jubilee, Tri-Net
and Green Machine) into EPS under the MAC brand name. EPS has also announced plans to add two additional equity owners:
Mellon Bank Corporation and National City Corporation. Locally and regionally, the affiliates of PNC Bank, Bank
One, and National City Bank will actively participate in the MAC network and will be converting their cardholder base
and ATM terminals to the MAC brand. Liberty National Bank, which is being acquired by Banc One Corporation, has also
joined and will likewise actively participate in the MAC network. Liberty will be converting their cardholder base
and ATM terminals to the MAC brand, and will be re-marketing MAC access to other financial institutions throughout
the region.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These developments will cause a majority of the ATM and POS transactions currently processed by the Quest Network
to be converted to the MAC brand. It is difficult to develop a reasonable long-term business case for the continuation
of the Quest Network and its Quest brand when a significant portion of the transaction processing business will be
directed to the MAC network.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The owners of the Quest Network believe that the time to begin an orderly transition from the Quest brand is at hand.
The Quest Network will offer transition assistance to each of its participants, if requested, and has begun to develop
a plan to assist those participants wishing to convert to the MAC network. The Quest Network will also assist participants
that wish to convert to another network, if requested. This transition period will begin in July 1994 and will conclude
by June 1995. The Quest Network, therefore, does not expect to operate beyond June 1, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We appreciate your past loyalty, support and participation in the Quest Network and pledge to work with you and your
processors to effect a timely transition with minimal disruption to your financial institution and your customers.
If you have questions, please feel free to contact any of the owners of the Quest Network regarding any aspect of this
announcement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
In response to the invitation extended on page 24712 of the May 12, 1994 edition of the Federal Register (59 FR 24712),
Cash Station, Inc. comments on the proposed Final Judgment filed in the proceeding named above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cash Station, Inc. operates a regional automated teller machine (``ATM'') and point-of-sale terminal (``POS'')
network, and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our comments are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Paragraph IV.H_Branding Restrictions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Paragraph IV.H of the proposed Final Judgment requires EPS to permit MAC members to display multiple network marks
on ATMs and ATM cards, stating that ``Defendant shall in no manner restrict any depository institution ATM deployer
that chooses to be affiliated with multiple ATM networks from displaying multiple ATM network logos on its ATMs *&blank;*&blank;*
[and] shall not prohibit any institution ATM card issuer located in [specified states] *&blank;*&blank;* from issuing
cards that display multiple ATM logos.'' Despite that restriction, EPS is permitted to ``restrict the branding of
access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value function.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming that it is appropriate to limit EPS's ability to restrict co-branding in connection with the ``MAC'' logo,
the exclusion of stored value cards from this limitation creates a significant loophole for EPS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, as drafted in the proposed Final Judgment, the stored value card exception appears to allow EPS to retain its
prohibition on co-branding simply by causing all of its debit cards to be reissued on card stock that has, in addition
to the magnetic stripe found on the cards currently issued, and integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value
function. We expect that many of EPS's smart cards will be multipurpose cards that bear both the traditional magnetic
strip technology found on today's on-line debit cards and an integrated computer chip with a stored value function.
Assuming that it is appropriate to provide relief on the branding restrictions in the case of the stored value cards
(see below), Paragraph IV.H. should specify that such relief applies only to cards that function solely through use
of the computer chip and do not also function as a traditional debit card using existing magnetic strip technology.
Otherwise, the benefits sought to be obtained under Paragraph IV.H. may be illusory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, again assuming the EPS is entitled to some relief with respect to its stored value card, we question whether
EPS should be allowed to further the market power enjoyed by the ``MAC'' ATM brand by suing that brand to identify the
store value card technology. In other words, if EPS is allowed to avoid the effects of the Final Judgment in connection
with an ancillary product, should it not also be precluded from promoting the ancillary product with the brand that
is central to the Final Judgment?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it is not clear why any protection is appropriate in the case of EPS's stored value card product. It is our understanding
that EPS did not invent the chip card technology but is simply applying existing technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Paragraph IV.I._Voidability of Existing Processing Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed Final Judgment does not clearly indicate that the contracts entered into illegally by EPS for ATM processing
and authorization processing are voidable at any time by the financial institutions. Paragraph IV.A of the proposed
Final Judgment states that EPS ``shall not maintain or enforce any *&blank;*&blank;* contract, agreement or arrangement''
that furthers the tying practices that are the subject of the proceeding, and Paragraph IV.I. of the proposed Final
Judgment allows EPS to sign up new customers by delivering a copy of the Final Judgment (apparently on a prospective
basis only), but nowhere is it stated affirmatively that each of EPS's existing ATM and authorization processing
customers may cancel its processing agreements with EPS at any time without penalty or that EPS must notify its customers
of their rights to terminate these agreements. If it is not made clear that the existing contracts are voidable, EPS
may enjoy the benefits of the tying arrangements through the expiration of these contracts, which may not occur for
several years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=75 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments of Citicorp Credit Services, Inc., Concerning the Proposed Consent Decree in United States v. Electronic
Payments Services, Inc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(b), Citicorp Credit Services,
Inc. (``Citicorp'') submits these comments concerning the proposed consent decree in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
United States 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Electronic Payments Services, Inc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on April 21, 1994, and published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
on May 12, 1994. Citicorp is not a member of defendant Electronic Payment Services' (``EPS'') ATM network, Money Access
Service (``MAC''). Citicorp is, however, involved in all aspects of electronic fund payments, including credit
cards, ATM cards, and, more recently, access cards containing an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value
function, or ``smart cards''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint on which the consent decree is based alleges that MAC is the largest ATM network in the United States by
transaction volume; that EPS has entered into agreements with a multitude of banks in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware,
and other states; that more than ninety percent of all ATMs in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware are connected
to MAC; that MAC is the ``dominant'' ATM network in those states; and that ``nearly all banks'' regard MAC as, in effect,
an essential facility for entry into the ATM business. (&para;&para; 14, 19, 20.) The Complaint further alleges that
EPS has used its ``monopoly power'' to exclude competitors from the ATM business in MAC's areas of dominance. (&para;25.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent decree is intended to put an end to EPS' anticompetitive practices and thereby to increase ATM
network competition. Citicorp is concerned, however, that the proposed consent decree could be understood_or,
more likely, misunderstood_to give EPS license to engage in what may be anticompetitive conduct with respect to the
smart card business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The source of this concern is Paragraph H of Section IV of the proposed consent decree. Among other things, that Paragraph
prohibits EPS from restricting MAC-member banks from issuing ATM cards that display multiple ATM network logos.
The Paragraph goes on to state, however, that EPS ``may restrict'' multiple branding of smart cards. The Competitive
Impact Statement asserts that permitting EPS to restrict multiple branding of smart cards will not lessen the pro-competitive
impact of the consent decree (page 16, n.10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citicorp understands these statements to mean only that restrictions on multiple branding of smart cards are not
prohibited by the consent decree. But the language is not clear and could be read to manifest a conclusion by the Department
of Justice that restrictions on multiple branding, and perhaps other EPS restrictions on smart cards, are not anticompetitive.
No such conclusion is warranted on this record, and the Department should make clear that it has reached no such conclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is too early to know whether future restrictions on smart card branding, or other restrictions not barred by the
proposed consent decree, would be procompetitive or anticompetitive. It is not difficult to imagine, however, how
EPS could engage in anticompetitive practices that could injure the fledgling smart card business if EPS' dominant
position in the ATM network market persists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if successful development of non-MAC smart card networks required participation of many or all of the
thousands of MAC-member banks, EPS could deal a crippling blow to competing smart card networks by prohibiting MAC-member
banks from participating in non-MAC smart card networks. Similarly, if access to the MAC ATM network were essential
to the success of competing smart cards, EPS could doom competitors by prohibiting such access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPS could achieve the same objectives through less direct means. EPS could impose operating rules or technical restrictions
on third-party processors that as a practical matter make it impossible for MAC-member banks' ATM machines to be accessed
by non-MAC smart cards or cards that utilize a technology different from that used for MAC smart cards.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Such restrictions would be similar to the ATM network processing restrictions that are prohibited by the proposed
consent decree.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, EPS utilizes the smart card technology offered by Gem Plus. Competitors including Microcard, Schlumberger,
IBM, and AT&amp;T offer different technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Restrictions on multiple smart card branding could also make it economically infeasible for banks to participate
in more than one smart card network. MAC-member banks that issue MAC smart cards would have to issue additional cards
to give their customers access to non-MAC machines and networks. The resulting additional costs could discourage
MAC-member banks from participating in other smart card networks and thereby impede the development of competing
networks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Depending on the circumstances, any of these kinds of restrictions could reduce competition and prevent the development
of alternative, and perhaps superior, smart card technologies. The risk, in short, is that EPS could use its existing
dominant power in ATM networks and ATM processing, and the MAC-member banks' control of essential facilities, to
prevent the establishment of competing smart card networks and thereby leverage its ATM monopoly into market power
in the smart card business. If so, EPS' restrictions could injure both MAC-member banks (and their customers) and,
perhaps more important, entities (and their potential customers) that would prefer not to join MAC but rather to compete
against it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, Citicorp urges the Department of Justice to make clear for the Court and the public that the proposed
consent decree does not authorize EPS to impose any branding restrictions for smart cards or reflect any conclusion
by the Department about the competitive significance of any potential EPS restrictions regarding smart cards. Such
a clarification would not require any substantive changes to the proposed consent decree. Instead, the Department
could clarify the meaning of the proposed consent decree in the response to the public comments that it submits to the
Court pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of smart card technology and networks offers enormous potential benefits to the public. Citicorp
urges the Department to keep a watchful eye in order to prevent anticompetitive conduct by EPS that could hinder the
full development of smart card technology and its applications.

Dear Mr. Rosen: I wish to state my opposition to the exception provision offered in the Consent Decree against EPS,
Inc. regarding the limited branding of Smart Cards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sepcifically, the exception will eventually undermine the intent of the Decree to allow for greater competition
if allowed to stand without greater clarity. EPS should not be permitted to have a privileged posture on limited branding
for cards containing an intergrated chip simply because they are heavily into its innovation. Future growth of this
technology will require greater acceptance and access considerations to wit this provision ignores. Make the better
and far more universal interpretation that branding of all types of cards is in the greater interest of competition
and eliminate this loophole provision.

Dear Mr. Liefesbind: On behalf of Meridian Bancorp, Inc., ``Meridian,'' a bank &amp; financial services holding
company headquartered in Reading, Pennsylvania, I would like to make the following comments to the Consent Decree
relating to the branding of electronic stored value cards (smart cards).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is our opinion that the provision in Section IV (H) which would allow EPS to ``restrict the branding of access cards
that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with stored value function'' is contrary to the competitive provisions
being decreed in the balance of paragraph H. This exemption implies that EPS would be able to regulate the market by
mandating that it's member institutions only issue smart cards that carry the EPS brand, and that only cards that carry
the sole EPS brand would be capable of accessing accounts at an EPS certified ATM machine. An issuer that belongs to
other networks would have to issue secondary cards, at additional expenses, to allow it's customers access via non-EPA
networks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, we would also like to point out the inconsistency in the implied assumption that a smart card is different
from an ordinary ATM card which carries a magnetic stripe. It is quite likely that both features would have to co-exist
on the same card to allow account access as well as ``refueling'' of the electronic chip at nationally branded terminals
such as CIRRUS and PLUS outside of the EPS market area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By allowing EPS to dictate the non-branding of these cards a loophole has been created which would allow EPS to control
network access of it's member banks and restrict the competitive potential of other regional networks. We feel that
this exception should be removed from the Consent Decree and in fact specific language should indicate that smart
card and smart card technology are included within the scope of the decree.

Ladies and Gentlemen: Chemical Banking Corporation (``Chemical'') appreciates this opportunity to comment on
the proposed consent decree in the above captioned action (the ``Consent Decree''). All terms capitalized in this
letter and not defined herein are used with the definitions assigned to them in the Consent Decree. Based on the analysis
set out below, Chemical is concerned that Section IV&hyph;H of the Consent Decree may create a serious threat to competitors
of EPS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Chemical is a bank holding company incorporated in the state of Delaware which participates through certain of its
subsidiary banks in many ATM networks. Chemical is also a shareholder in the New York Switch Corporation (``NYS'')
which owns, operates and controls the New York Cash Exchange ATM network (the ``NYCE Network'') and will be a shareholder
in the proposed network to be formed by the merger of the New York Switch Corporation and NENI Inc. when such network
is approved. Chemical's subsidiaries, Chemical Bank and Chemical Bank New Jersey, N.A., are each a participant in
both the MAC and the NYCE networks, among other ATM networks. Through its subsidiary, Chemical Bank, Chemical is working
on projects involving the use of smart card technology and has implemented a pilot project using AT&amp;T technology
to test various smart card applications.

Re: Comments of Money Station, Inc. on Proposed Final Judgment in United States v. Electronic Payment Services, Inc.,
Civ. No. 94&hyph;208, D. Del.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Gentlemen: Money Station, Inc. (Money Station) submits this comment pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Sections 16(b), (d), on
the proposed Final Judgment in United States vs. Electronic Payment Services, Inc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 published on May 12, 1994, at 59 Fed. Reg. 24711 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Competitive Impact Statement published along with the proposed Final Judgment, Electronic Payment
Services, Inc. (EPS) has maintained a ``tying arrangement that is per se unlawful'' by foreclosing independent third-party
ATM processors (id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 24718) as ``has maintained a monopoly in regional ATM network access'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) in numerous states, including ``substantial portions of the state of Ohio'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
id
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). The proposed Final Judgment is intended to advance the public interest in both a direct and an indirect way. The intended
direct benefit is to increase competition in the market for ATM processing services by eliminating the tying arrangement.
The intended indirect benefit is to increase competition in the market for regional ATM access by making it possible
for banks to join multiple ATM networks through third-party ATM processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Money Station operates an ATM network principally located in Ohio, but which also has participants located in Kentucky,
Indiana and West Virginia (where EPS is also alleged to have monopoly power) with ATM machines that bear the Money Station
trademark and are linked to the Money Station network. Money Station represents exactly the kind of potential and
actual competition that the Government looks to as a means of making the market for regional ATM access more competitive
in the geographic areas where MAC is currently the ubiquitous network with market power. Consequently, Money Station
has reviewed the proposed Final Judgment carefully.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Money Station agrees with the Government that elimination of the tying arrangement, if effectively implemented,
will open up competition for ATM processing services. Money Station, however, has far less confidence that competition
in ATM processing services can overcome the ``collective action program,'' referred to in the Competitive Impact
Statement, in the market for regional ATM access. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 24720.) There are genuine economic costs associated with joining more than one regional network (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 card issuance costs, signage costs). Unless multiple banks act simultaneously to join one or more competing networks
in addition to the ubiquitous network, no benefits can accrue to the individual bank that joins one or more such competing
networks. In other words, no bank will incur the costs to join network B in addition to the ubiquitous network A unless
network B provides sufficient ATMs and cards that the bank's transaction volume flowing through network B generates
enough income (or savings) to justify the costs associated with joining network B. That transaction volume depends
on the actions of other banks. This ``collective action'' problem is exacerbated if the ubiquitous network with market
power is able to establish any disincentives (whether technical or economic) against joining other networks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, Money Station recognizes that elimination of the tying arrangement challenged in the complaint in
this case, if effectively implemented, does open up competition for ATM processing services and is thus in the public
interest. Money Station further recognizes that elimination of the tying arrangement, again if effectively implemented,
is a necessary first step, even if not a totally sufficient step, in opening up the market for regional ATM access and
so, again, is in the public interest. Money Station therefore supports the proposed Final Judgment as a general matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure, however, the effectiveness of the proposed Final Judgment, Money Station recommends that several issues
be addressed before the proposed Final Judgment is approved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
First, the same card that provides access to ATMs also usually provides access to POS devices, and virtually every
ATM network, including the networks operated by EPS and Money Station, also operates a POS network. As Money Station
reads the proposed Final Judgment, EPS is free in the future to place restrictions on members of its MAC network (which
operates both a POS and ATM network) with respect to their right to be members in other POS networks or even, possibly,
on their right to use third-party processors for their POS outlets. Such POS-related restrictions, if imposed, would
add to the entry barriers in regional ATM access already created by the ``collective action'' problem. The proposed
Final Judgment should be clarified so that access to the MAC ATM network or to the MAC POS network is not denied, impeded,
or discriminated against through pricing or other means if a financial institution elects to join a competing POS
network.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Money Station believes that EPS enjoys a position of dominance with respect to access to regional POS networks that
is comparable to the dominant position EPS has maintained in markets for regional ATM network access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the proposed Final Judgment uses the phrase ``shall not restrict in any manner'' or similar phrases several
times. For example, Section IV(H) mandates that ``Defendant shall in no manner restrict any depository institution
ATM deployer from enabling ATMs to function in multiple ATM networks.'' There is no definition of the verb ``restrict''
in the proposed Final Judgment. The proposed Final Judgment clearly does prohibit directly exclusionary contracts
and discriminatory pricing related to ATM network membership. However, it is not clear that the proposed Final Judgment
deals effectively with various other disincentives that EPS may establish that would further discourage banks from
incurring the already significant costs and risks of joining multiple networks. Although the proposed Final Judgment
does prohibit penalties imposed on or direct legal obstructions to a bank's joining a competitive network, it is not
clear that a reward for not joining to competitive network is a restriction under the proposed Final Judgment. Given
EPS's history of practices to preserve its monopoly in the regional ATM access, it seems prudent to clarify that the
phrase ``shall not restrict'' bars any practice that creates disincentives for a bank to belong to multiple networks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, Section IV(G)(2) of the proposed Final Judgment appears on its face to give EPS the discretion, with respect
to transactions between depository institutions that are members of an EPS network and switched by a third-party
processor, to impose a royalty fee equal to the price of transactions switched (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
processed) by EPS itself. Because the third-party processor must charge some fee to cover its costs in this situation,
the combination of a license fee equal to EPS's fee (referred to in this provision as ``loyalties that shall not be greater
than the price for switched transactions'') plus the third-party processor's fee will necessarily exceed EPS's
direct fee. Therefore, this provision appears to give EPS a means to continue to hamper severely third-party processors
seeking to dissipate EPS's monopoly power. This may well negate the effectiveness of the proposed Final Judgment's
intent to open up competition in the ATM processing services and, indirectly, in regional ATM access. In Money Station's
view, Section IV(G)(2) should either be revised or clarified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, Money Station believes that skeptical scrutiny should be given to the provision in Section IV(H) that permits
EPS to ``restrict the branding of access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value
function.'' This language is an exemption for what are known as ``smart cards'' from the requirement in Section IV(H)
that EPS cannot bar ATM card issuers that choose to be affiliated with multiple ATM networks from issuing cards that
display multiple ATM network logos or from displaying multiple ATM network logos on their ATMs. Money Station believes
that this exemption could well have a powerful anti-competitive effect on the development and competitiveness of
ATM networks other than EPS. This effect would occur if EPS took the position that the exemption language applied to
access cards that contain both a normal ``mag stripe'' feature_as do most ATM cards_as well as a ``smart card'' feature.
If so, and if EPS inserted a ``smart card'' feature on an appreciable number of cards with a traditional ``mag stripe''
feature,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 the multi-branding purpose of Section IV(H)_which seeks to sustain the competitiveness of other ATM networks_would
be undermined. In addition, Money Station is concerned that as a result of this exemption, EPS will require that ATM
or POS machines that are part of EPS's network may not accept ATM or POS cards with a ``smart card'' feature other than
that utilized or approved by EPS. In this event, the pro-competitive purpose of preventing EPS from barring co-branding
of ATM machines would also be undermined. To the best of Money Station's knowledge, EPS is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a developer of ``smart card'' technology, but simply a customer of developers of that technology. Money Station thus
believes that the theory cited in support of the exemption_``that *&blank;*&blank;* restrictive branding of electronic
stored value cards will encourage innovation and competition'' in connection with such cards
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
_has no applicability to EPS.

Money Station believes that this is highly likely because EPS is likely to want its access cards to work at ATM machines
that lack an EPS trademark, but contain the PLUS or CIRRUS trademarks and that are configured only to accept cards with
a ``mag stripe.''

Dear. Mr. Rosen: I am writing on behalf of The New York Switch Corporation (``NYS'') to comment on the proposed Stipulation,
Final Judgment (``the decree''), and Competitive Impact Statement in United States v. Electronic Payment Services,
Inc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (``EPS''), Civ. No. 94&hyph;208, as set out at 59 Fed. Reg. 24711 (May 12, 1994). NYS operates the NYCE
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 ATM/POS network. For many years, NYCE has been foreclosed from competing against EPS' MAC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 network in Pennsylvania and other states where MAC has successfully established monopoly power through the very
types of exclusionary practices which are the subject of the decree. By prohibiting its members from joining NYCE
or selecting NYCE as their processor, EPS has largely succeeded in insulating itself from competition from NYCE,
as well as from other regional ATM networks and third party processors, in Pennsylvania and a number of other states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remedial purpose of the proposed decree is to check EPS' market power by facilitating the entry of competing regional
ATM networks and ATM processors into markets in which EPS has heretofore exercised market power through various exclusionary
practices. To that end, the decree would prohibit EPS from restricting its depository institution members from belonging
to other networks; under the decree, EPS also cannot restrict any depository institution from (i) ``displaying multiple
ATM network logos on its ATMs''; (ii) ``issuing cards that display multiple ATM network logos''; or (iii) ``enabling
ATMs to function in multiple ATM network.''
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 NYS applauds the Department of Justice for bringing this action and for achieving the foregoing remedial provisions,
which NYS supports.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
What concerns NYS is the ambiguity and potential for abuse of the exception permitting EPS to ``restrict the branding

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
that contain
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 (referred to as ``smart cards''). According to the Competitive Impact Statement, the Department has concluded that
``[p]ermitting EPS to restrict the multiple branding on smart cards will not undercut the impact of the decree because
the branding of ordinary ATM cards, which are not by far more common, is not restricted.''
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In conjunction with this statement, the Department cites the contention of EPS ``that allowing restrictive in services

NYS believes that this provision, which is an exception to the general prohibitory thrust of the decree, creates a
potential loophole which EPS could interpret to perpetuate its exclusionary practices with respect to ATM cards.
For this reason, while NYS generally supports the decree, it nevertheless urges the Department to withhold its consent
unless the exception is modified or clarified as suggested below to reduce its anticompetitive potential.

NYS submits that the ambiguous language of the smart-card exception (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``cards that contain'' the stored value function) could allow EPS to continue its exclusionary conduct with respect
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
ATM cards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 simply by merging the ATM cards with smart-card functionality. The Competitive Impact Statement does not appear
to recognize the ability of EPS to take advantage of the smart-card exception to avoid the prohibitions of the decree.
Based on its knowledge of the impending market impact of smart cards, NYS strongly believes that the Department must
directly address the anticompetitive potential of this ambiguous smart-card exception.

2. The Smart Card Exception Undermines the Purposes of the Decree
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
EPS has established a pattern of excluding competitors by conditioning its financial institutions' membership
on their agreement not to belong to other networks and not to use the brands of those networks on their cards and ATMs.
NYS is concerned that the smart-card exception could be interpreted and exploited by EPS to subvert the general prohibitions
in the decree against ATM and ATM card branding restrictions. Through this exception, EPS would be able to convert
its ATM cards to dual-function cards and escape the prohibitions of the decree, to the detriment of NYS competition
generally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's acceptance of the smart-card exception appears to rest on two premises: one is that stored value
cards, with their computer-chip component, are so distinct from ``ordinary ATM cards'' (which rely on magnetic stripe
technology) that the exception will not significantly affect the member institutions' use of ``ordinary ATM cards''
which are the primary focus of the Complaint; the other premise appears to be that the current number of smart cards
is still relatively low compared with the number of ordinary ATM cards and that any anticompetitive consequences
of the exception will therefore be negligible. NYS disagrees with both premises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It cannot be assumed that ``ordinary ATM cards'' and smart cards are and will remain separate, stand-alone devices.
NYS has reason to believe that the smart card being marketed by EPS to financial institutions is not, in fact, a product
separate from the ordinary ATM card but is instead a hybrid, multi-function card that contains 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
both
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 a computer chip with stored value functionality 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 a magnetic stripe with on-line debit functionality. This dual functionality in a single card is already being tested
and its use is likely to increase substantially in the near future. Moreover, as several industry publications disclose,
EPS intends to offer a multi-purpose smart card which is basically a combination ATM/stored value card. For example,
one source reports that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Consumers will get a micro-chip smart card that also has a mag-stripe on back. The card will be available for both on-line
debit and off-line prepaid debit applications. When consumers use the card in an ATM or on-line POS application, a
terminal will read the mag-stripe and when used in an off-line prepaid application, the terminal will read and deduct
funds from the chip memory.

Nor is it correct to assume that the number of smart cards will remain relatively low. Although just emerging, smart-card
applications are expected to expand rapidly. EPS apparently intends to market its smart card aggressively to financial
institutions throughout its service area. While the Department correctly observes that the number of smart cards
is now relatively small when compared with ordinary ATM cards, EPS has made it clear that it sees the potential for significant
growth in the use of its hybrid ATM card with a computer chip.

The decree explicitly bars EPS from restricting its members' branding of ATM cards. Yet, the intention and effect
of the smart-card exception are ambiguous. It is possible that EPS would be able to prohibit all of its member banks
from placing the NYCE brand or other competing network brands
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 card (including an ``ordinary ATM card'') simply by adding a computer chip with stored value functionality to its
cards, a modification which is neither difficult nor expensive.

Of course, the smart-card exception would also permit EPS selectively to allow dual branding with national network
brands while prohibiting co-branding with NYCE and other regional network competitors. In this manner, EPS could
exclude NYCE (one of its strongest competitors) from those very areas where, as the Competitive Impact Statement
notes, the MAC network has a history of ``largely successful efforts to keep competitors out. *&blank;*&blank;*''

If the smart-card exception could be interpreted in the manner just suggested, the potential for exclusion of competing
networks through the exception is not an imaginary concern. A recent article in the trade press has reported that Delaware
financial institutions accounting for over 90% of the state's DDA base will issue EPS smart cards.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 As the Complaint notes, the MAC network already has a monopoly position in Delaware; virtually all Delaware financial
institutions belong to MAC. Given MAC's dominance, the smart-card exception will offer MAC another vehicle for erecting
a barrier to entry into the state. If the exception means that EPS can tell its financial institution members that they
cannot put the NYCE brand on any MAC-branded cards because those cards also happen to contain an integrated computer
chip for stored value functionality, those institutions will have to issue (at considerable cost) separate cards
if they wish to offer access to NYCE. In those states where MAC already has a monopoly, it is difficult to see what possible
incentive the financial institutions would have for joining NYCE at all.

Furthermore, the smart-card exception is ambiguous not only with respect to exclusive branding of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
cards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 but also with respect to exclusive branding of ATMs. Under the decree, EPS is barred from restricting its members'
multiple branding of ATMs and from restricting ``any depository institution ATM deployer from enabling ATMs to function
in multiple ATM networks.'' NYS is concerned, however, about ambiguity in the Competitive Impact Statement, where
it says, ``EPS must permit MAC members to display multiple network marks 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
on ATMs 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

except for electronic stored value cards.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 It is NYS' understanding that EPS' smart cards will be used in its existing ATMs which will be retrofitted to handle
the additional smart-card functionality. If EPS is permitted, through an evasive interpretation of the smart-card
exception, to refuse acceptance of smart cards bearing any brand other than its own at ATMs in its network the decree's
objective of facilitating competitive access by other networks to customers in states where EPS has ATM dominance
will be seriously undermined. This issue also requires clarification.

In the Competitive Impact Statement, the Department acknowledges the following justification for the smart-card
exception: ``allowing restrictive branding of electronic stored value cards will encourage innovation and competition
in services among firms marketing such cards.''
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 In NYS' judgment, this is not correct and does not justify the smart-card exception, even if the exception is meant
to apply only to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
stand-alone
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 smart cards; this reason certainly does not justify application of the exception to a

Smart cards are used in both ``closed system'' and ``open system'' environments. ``Closed systems'' include both
single-vendor stored value systems and systems designed for single-site use, such as a public transit system or a
university campus. An ``open system'' refers to a multiple-vendor, multiple-site system, similar to a POS network
in which the value stored on the card can be used at a wide range of participating vendors.

a single customer 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
of the technology. The actual producers and innovators of smart-card technology are data-technology firms such
as Schlumberger, GemPlus, Microcard, IBM and AT&amp;T. To the extent the EPS'

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

For example, NYS is aware that Chemical Bank has developed and is pilot-testing a card with an embedded, integrated
circuit chip and a co-resident magnetic stripe, which allows holders to do regular ATM transactions and to pay for
purchases with stored cash value. Chemical Bank's cards will be used in ATMs equipped with smart-card reader/writer
capability. Citicorp is also reported to be testing a smart card.

Most importantly, it is difficult to see how permitting EPS to restrict its member banks from putting the logos of NYCE
and other networks on their smart cards in those states where EPS has market power will encourage innovation or technological
competition. While NYS recognizes that, under certain conditions, a restriction on co-branding of a product may
stimulate interbrand competition (thereby stimulating innovation), this benefit is achievable only where the
firm imposing the restriction is in fact 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
subject
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 to interbrand competition. The Complaint, however, makes clear that EPS has no competition in at least five states;
in those states, EPS has the ability to lock financial institutions into use of a single smart card, thereby excluding
any competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum NYS believes that the smart-card exception will not promote innovation in the development of smart-card technology,
even if the scope of the exception is confined to smart cards only. It is certain that an ambiguous exception which would
permit evasion of the decree would not be not be justified on that basis.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent and scope of the smart-card exception contained in Paragraph IV.H of the proposed decree are ambiguous.
The exception is susceptible to an interpretation by which EPS could continue the exclusionary practices which the
decree seeks to redress simply by adding the smart-card function to its ATM cards. surely the Department did not intend
to create such a device for evasion of the decree. NYS respectfully submits that the exception should be amended to
clarify that the exception applies 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 to the banding of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
stand-alone, single-function
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 smart cards (those with stored value functionality provided by an integrated computer chip) and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 to any type of multiple-function or hybrid ATM cards (those that use magnetic stripe technology).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To repeat, NYS supports the general thrust of the proposed decree and greatly appreciates the efforts of the Department
to open the MAC network to competition. Even so, the ambiguity of the smart-card exception and the potential for circumvention
of the decree compel the submission of these comments and concerns.

Cards issued by depository institutions and activated by the holder's entry of a personal identification number
(PIN) can be used in ATMs located at financial institutions and in or near retail establishments, as well as in point-of-sale
(POS) debit terminals at merchants. When the card is used in an ATM, the cardholder enters his personal identification
number. The transaction is then authorized by the financial institution that issued the card, the cardholder receives
the authorized amount of cash, and the depository account to which the card is tied is debited by that amount. When the
card is used in a POS terminal for a debit transaction, the transaction likewise begins with entry of the cardholder's
PIN and an on-line authorization of the transaction from the card-issuing financial institution. Once the transaction
is approved, the customer receives the merchandise or services and, in many cases, cash back from the merchant (in
rough analogy to paying for groceries with a check for more than the amount of the purchase). A hold is then immediately
put on the customer's funds on deposit for subsequent payment to the merchant.

Like the market for processing services, the market for ownership of ATMs and other similar devices has expanded well
beyond depository institutions. However, the judgment is somewhat ambiguous as to its application to ATMs owned
by entities other than depository institutions. It should be clarified to provide that all ATMs, and not just ATMs
owned by depository institutions, are included within its scope. Today, six non-depository institutions rank among
the top 300 ATM owners, owning more than 3,000 terminals. (See Discussion,

, under Comment No. 2.) According to a survey published by Faulkner &amp; Gray in 1993, in the next 7 years significant
growth is expected in the EFT market, which encompasses both ATM and POS. Until now, the growth in EFT has primarily
been fueled by ATM growth. While ATM growth is expected to continue, it is projected that the most sizeable increases
in the EFT market will come from debit POS. Many networks have predicted that POS alone will grow by more than 50% a year
and, that by the year 2000, POS transactions will exceed ATM transactions. (See Exh. D, 1994

it less and less effectual as time progresses and the EFT market changes.

Moreover, it is not apparent that the Department of Justice conducted a thorough review of the existing operating,
technical, and financial requirements that restrict third party processors' access to the network, or the pricing
mechanisms governing such access, to ensure that the order truly provides third party processors with meaningful,
non-discriminatory access to the network. As discussed in Comments 3 and 4, below, the operating, technical and financial
regulations, and the complex pricing structure imposed by MAC and other networks, have the potential to pose a mine
field, severely restraining third party entry to the processing market. Those regulations and pricing must be examined
carefully and safeguards need to be put in place to assure future compliance with the judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in order for the judgment to meet the Department's goal of eliminating MAC's monopoly power in card processing
in the affected region, the proposed Final Judgment must (1) extend to ATMs owned by non-depository institutions;
(2) encompass the debit POS network; (3) require the Department of Justice to review operating, technical, and financial
restrictions placed on third party processors by the ATM and debit networks and put related safeguards into place
to ensure that the networks provide

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 access by third party processors; and (4) require the Department of Justice to examine the pricing structure of the
networks, and put certain safeguards into place, to be certain that the costs assessed to third party processors are
truly non-discriminatory.

Section II.B of the proposed Final Judgment defines ``ATM'' as a machine ``typically owned and deployed by a depository
institution.'' The first sentence of section II.H defines depository institution as ``a bank, saving bank, savings
and loan association, credit union or other institution authorized by federal or state law to take deposits.'' In
a second sentence, Section II.H of the judgment goes on to state that, for purposes of the Final Judgment, depository
institution includes ``any other member of a branded ATM network operated by defendant that also deploys ATMs within
that network.''

boasted among its list of the ``Top 300 ATM Owners'' two supermarket chains, Publix Super Markets, Inc. and Wegmans
Food and Pharmacy, which, obviously, lack the demand deposit accounts necessary to constitute a ``depository institution''
within the meaning of the first sentence of section II.H. (See Exh. E., which ranks Publix as the 21st largest ATM owner
in the United States with 483 ATMs, and Wegmans as number 106 with 91 ATMs.) The 1994

showed a marked increase in the number of non-depository institutions owning ATMs and the number of ATMs owned by those
institutions: the number of non-depository institutions owning ATMs increased from two to six, and the number of
ATMs owned by such non-depository institutions increased from 574 ATMs (in 1992) to 3343 (in 1993). (See Exh. F, listing
Electronic Data Systems Inc. as number 7, with 1,200 ATMs; Affiliated Computer Systems as number 10, with 950 ATMs;
Publix as number 28 with 497 ATMs; FIserv as number 29, with 496 ATMs; Delchamps Supermarkets as number 98, with 100
ATMs; and Wegmans as number 100, with 100 ATMs.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the rapidly changing identity of the ATM owners, the failure to expressly include in the Final Judgment
ATMs owned and deployed by non-depository institutions creates a substantial potential loophole in the judgment.
As the judgment will remain in effect for the next 10 years, such a possible loophole could have an adverse effect on
competition. Unless the judgment is clarified to include ATMs owned and deployed by non-depository institutions,
the goals of the judgment_to open up the ATM network and ATM processing markets to competition by prohibiting MAC from
discriminating against third party processors in terms of pricing and access_will not be effectuated in this growing
segment of the ATM market.

To the ultimate consumer, ATM and POS are interchangeable because they meet the same needs. MAC is a major factor in
both segments of the market. As POS terminals increasingly rival ATMs and credit cards as payment mechanisms, the
interests of the United States in opening both the network and the processing markets now dominated by MAC to competition
could be frustrated unless the Final Judgment is extended to encompass POS. Because the Final Judgment is to remain
in effect for 10 years, the failure to make that judgment applicable to point-of-sale debit networks could leave that
substantial, fast-growing segment of the market subject to the same abuses by MAC that the ATM system has been and allow
MAC to evade the purpose and intent of the order.

do not impose requirements on third party processors, or give MAC control over unnecessary devices or equipment,

The goal of the Final Judgment is to open up the processing market to competition. Section IV.E of the Final Judgment
requires defendant EPS to permit third party processors to access the MAC network on the same terms as intercept processors
so long as the third party processor meets the technical, financial and operating criteria for intercept processors.
It also permits MAC to impose such additional technical criteria, regarding information transmitted and the format
for transmission of such information, as is ``reasonably appropriate for third party ATM processing for unaffiliated
multiple banks.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the abstract, requiring MAC to give third party processors access to the MAC network on the same terms as intercept
processors is, potentially, an adequate means to achieve the United States' goal. However, the existing technical,
financial and operating rules and procedures applicable to intercept processors should not be endorsed by entry
of a consent decree unless and until they have been thoroughly reviewed by persons with the requisite expertise.

The ATM and debit card processing businesses are rife with similar opportunities for dominant networks like MAC to
manipulate interconnection requirements and related financial and operating procedures to exclude competitors
by imposing on third party processors operating rules or technical and financial requirements with little or no legitimate
business purpose_rules and procedures designed to raise the costs to third party processors and thereby frustrate
competition. For example, one of the ``hottest'' technical developments in the field relates to the method of encryption
(or coding) of transactions to ensure their security as the cardholder's request is transmitted from the terminal
to the network to the card issuing institution, and the authorization and transaction instructions are transmitted
through the network, back to the terminal. Currently, MAC and others operate on a ``master key'' system, under which
all transactions from the terminal are given the same code. Many networks have indicated that they intend to change
to a ``DUKPT'' system, where every transaction will be given a unique key. Many processors, however, are not presently
equipped to operate on a DUKPT system, and they will require very substantial lead time (and need to invest substantial
funds) to modify or replace existing equipment. (For example, in the credit card processing industry, the lead time
for implementing changes reflecting technological advances often ranges from 3 to 5 years.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security of customer transactions is clearly a legitimate concern of the networks. However, before DUKPT or other
technical advances are implemented, the Department of Justice should have mechanisms in place to ensure the changes
meet legitimate needs and that they are implemented in a pro-competitive manner. Particularly in a business undergoing
rapid technological change, a mechanism is needed both to insure that the rules and regulations of the monopoly provider
are not designed to inhibit competition by other providers using existing technology and, at the same time, insure
that the MAC network be open to competitors using new and technologically superior equipment.

 Accordingly, before the Department of Justice recommends that the current rules governing intercept processors
be applied to third party processors, it should review MAC's technical, financial, and operating rules and determine
that those standards do not have a negative impact on competition.

Technical requirements are not the only area where card processors have already experienced abuse by dominant providers.
For example, ATM and debit networks have been known to impose upon third party processors unwarranted and unjustified
delays in transferring money to third party processor funding accounts. They have also required processors to send
significant numbers of their employees to network training sessions and charged prohibitive per employee fees,
where training of a small number of supervisory employees would suffice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure compliance by MAC with its obligation under the judgment to impose on third party, unaffiliated, multiple
bank processors only such additional technical criteria as is ``reasonably appropriate,'' and to be sure that all
subsequent modifications and additions to regulations and operating procedures made to keep pace with changing
technology are necessary and do not discriminate against third party processors, the decree should require MAC to
publish and circulate to third party processors for comment such modifications before their enactment. At a minimum,
MAC should be required to make those rules and procedures available to third party processors at the same time that
they are available to intercept processors. Providing third party processors with the right to review and comment
on proposed technical requirements could give third party processors the opportunity to recommend less costly but
equally secure measures (if such measures are available and adequate) and, in any event, would ensure that third party
processors are informed of technical changes in a timely fashion so that they can comply with such changes. These proposed
modifications to the proposed Final Judgment will promote industry self-regulation and assure that third party
processors are not frozen-out by unnecessary technical, financial or operational requirements, or changes made
to those requirements on short notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The present pricing structure for access by third party processors to the network should be evaluated and modified
to require MAC (a) periodically to publish its pricing schedules; (b) to unbundle its switch fee to third party processors;
and (c) to eliminate the requirement that third party processors be sponsored by a MAC member.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section IV.G prohibits MAC from discriminating in the pricing of branded ATM network access to the MAC network on the
basis of a customer's choice of ATM processor. Specifically, section G.1 of the Final Judgment mandates that third
party processors receive the same volume discounts as intercept processors. Section G.2 provides that royalties
charged to third party processors to switch transactions between member depository institutions not be greater
than the price charged by MAC to switch such transactions. Section G.3 requires MAC to provide branded ATM service
pursuant to a nondiscriminatory price schedule. While these three limitations are helpful in fixing a pricing structure
that reduces barriers to entry by third party processors, the proposed Final Judgment does not go far enough in that
regard. The Department of Justice apparently has not examined the pricing mechanisms by which third party processors
are constrained and has not taken sufficient measures to assure that existing discriminatory pricing practices
have been eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of ATM transactions, a third party processor is ordinarily assessed a per transaction driving (or switch)
fee, a one time network (or membership) fee and, where the processor is a not a financial institution, it must be sponsored
by a member financial institution and pay that institution a sponsorship fee (which could be a one time or a per transaction
fee). Similarly, in the case of debit POS transactions, a third party processor pays a switch fee, a network (or membership
fee, and a sponsorship fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be certain that the order achieves its goal of eliminating discriminatory pricing and opening up the processing
market to competitors of MAC, the judgment should:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Mandate regular publication of MAC's prices, including volume discounts, so as not to discriminate against smaller
competitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is a simple, inexpensive means of policing MAC's obligation to offer non-discriminatory prices pursuant to
a non-discriminatory pricing schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Require MAC to unbundle its switch fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, branded ATM networks charge third party processors a ``switch fee'' for each transaction utilizing the
network. That per transaction fee is a bundled rate, comprised of a charge to the third party processor for the costs
to the network of electronically transferring the transaction information and a fee that is reimbursed to the card
issuer. The bundled rate has the effect of causing third party processors to bear a disproportionate share of the issuer's
costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Charging a unitary fee for bundled services is a classic form of anticompetitive abuse by a monopolist. Causing MAC
to unbundle its switch fee will foster competition by allowing MAC's competitors to decide which services they desire
to purchase and requiring them to pay only for those services actually used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Eliminate the requirement that, in addition to paying an ``acquirer'' membership fee, third party processors
be sponsored by a member financial institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the per transaction switch fee, MAC charges third party processors a membership fee. MAC, however,
prohibits non-depository, third party processors from becoming full-fledged members of MAC. Instead, under the
guise of maintaining the integrity of the MAC network, MAC requires that every third party processor be sponsored
by a MAC member; each sponsoring MAC member, in turn, requires the third party processor to pay a substantial sponsorship
fee. Those requirements, by definition, discriminate against non-depository institutions that act as third party
processors and deter competition in the processing market, without serving any legitimate business need.

In light of the 10-year life of the consent decree, it is critical that the Department of Justice close the loopholes
described above before the court endorses the judgment so that the judgment will keep pace with the changing nature
of the industry, and its rapid technological advances and thus, remain effective into the next century.

the resources needed to promote use of their cards. Old-line retailers are particularly hard-pressed, and those
programs have born the brunt of market retrenchment. New competitors such as specialty stores typically secure the
services of third-party private-label card issuers instead of managing their own store-card programs, so that segment
of the market is gaining on single-store cards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Major issuers of Visa and MasterCard are as likely to fill the role of third-party issuer as any other entity, and some
of them are scoring remarkable successes. One standout program is the Select card issued by First of America Bank in
partnership with home-improvement retailers such as furniture stores, carpet firms, and home centers. Those merchants
sell the type of big-ticket items that are most likely to need revolving credit, so the profit potential is significant
for the issuing bank. The merchants pay a flat monthly charge for acceptance, so they save money on their discount rates.
And cardholders get a lower APR than most Visa and MasterCard cards command.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bankruptcy filings continued to take a toll on private-label cards, both proprietary plastic and third-party cards.
Zale Corp.'s bankruptcy filing and liquidation in 1992 eliminated a major portion of the private-label portfolio
at NationsBank, which also ranks as the 10th largest bank card issuer.

BANKS' DIMINISHED MERCHANT ROLE
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In the merchant processing business, consolidation is accelerating, with the five largest processors commanding
more than 60% of the market. This part of the credit-card distribution system has come to be dominated by firms not controlled
by banks, a trend that concerns some executives in the banking community. The trend is continuing, with Citicorp leaving
the merchant arena in mid-1992. It sold Citicorp Establishment Services to venture capitalists who also own the industry's
largest independent sales organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
But the trend has an up-side for some issuers. The growth of third-party processors has helped smaller card issuers
maintain a niche in the market, analysts point out. Those issuers have been relieved of the need to maintain in-house
processing services while still enjoying the efficiencies of scale those processors bring. The biggest third-party
processors also are the most frequently cited merchant and cardholder processors used by the top 250 card issuers:
FDR rates 85 mentions in Chapter 4, and Total System is cited 60 times.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sheer size enables the largest issuers to process in-house, and efficiencies of scale are getting better for many
of them. Three major bank mergers affected the 10 largest bank card issuers since the directory's third edition was
published. Manufacturers Hanover Trust, the 10th largest a year ago, was merged into Chemical Bank to form the eighth
largest issuer. NCNB and C&amp;S/Sovran combined to form NationsBank. And BankAmerica maintained its position
as the fourth largest card issuer on the strength of its April 1992 merger with Security Pacific Bank.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mergers will keep the consolidation trend going. Comerica Bank already has merged with Manufacturers National Corp.,
and card operations were consolidated in August 1992. Security Bank &amp; Trust merged with First of America in April
1992, with merger of the respective credit card operations expected by mid-October. On May 2, 1992, Merchants National
Corp. merged with National City Corp., adopting the name National City Indiana in October.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The portfolio sale which drove consolidation in recent years became a non-factor after mid-year 1991. Whether they
return to their old prominence might depend on the overall health of the banking industry. A survey of banking executives
conducted in 1991 found 23% of those with total assets of $5 billion or more expected to sell their card portfolios by
the end of the decade because of a need to raise capital. If capital conditions become more favorable, either through
market forces or regulatory changes, many of those banks could decide to retain their portfolios.

AFFINITY CARDS ON THE WANE
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A credit card trend that may have run its course is the affinity card. Affinity programs reported by the 250 largest
card issuers in the 1992 survey totaled 2,654, a moderate improvement from the previous year's 2,404. But if the marketing
efforts of a single issuer, MBNA America, are factored out, a net loss occurred. MBNA lead the industry with 1,530 affinity
programs, but a score of issuers report fewer affinity programs now than a year ago.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All but two of the 250 credit card issuers in Chapter 4 are Visa/MasterCard issues, and the dominance of Visa plastic
continues to grow. In the directory's first edition, 54.5% of those issuer's card were Visa. The following year the
ration jumped to 57.1%., then 57.5%. In this latest survey, the Visa share has climbed to 58.4%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One other trend not readily apparent in the pages that follow is the decline in the average number of cards per credit-card
account. When the first edition of the directory was published three years ago, the top 250 issuers averaged 1.5 cards
per account. The ratio has steadily declined in the intervening years and know stands at 1.44 cards per account. That
tent is more likely a reflection of the social trend toward more single-person households and greater numbers of women
in the labor force than any concerted effort by card issuers to issue fewer cards per account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Likewise, the outlook for credit and debit profitability will probably be dictated by economic circumstances beyond
the industry's control. But industry competition will also play a major role, and the chapters in this directory give
the most complete presentation, segment by segment, of who the major competitors are and how they compare to the rest
of the industry.

The 25 Largest Merchant Acquirers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Consolidation is occurring in every segment of the bank card business, but no where is the pace faster than in the merchant
acquiring business. The 25 largest merchant acquirers presented in last year's edition of the Card Industry Directory
accounted for 48.75% of the Visa/MasterCard volume going through merchants; this year's roster held the merchant
contracts that accounted for 64% of 1992's billings. Concentration was especially pronounced at the top end of the
market, with the 10 largest merchant acquirers representing $148.6 billion in bank card billings_49% of 1992's market,
up from 33.7% in 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of merchant locations served by the leading acquirers did not change appreciably between January 1, 1992,
and January 1, 1993. The aggregate total of 1.6 million was only a 3 percent improvement, or 47,248 locations. But as
the bank card industry expands the utility of Visa and MasterCard cards to include health care providers, grocers,
movie theaters, and restaurants, the composite profile of the bank card merchant is changing. Still, the average
value of credit card transactions in 1992 was virtually unchanged from 1991 at $65.48, the industry's leading merchant
acquirers report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most remarkable growth on an individual-acquirer basis occurred at National Bancard Corp., which jumped into
the No. 1 position on the strength of 36% dollar-volume growth. Most of NaBANCO's $10.5 billion dollar gain was the
result of the acquisition of CFC Financial Services' merchant portfolio. Other big gainers in 1992 were NationsBank,
which moved from eighth to fifth on the list; First USA Merchant Services, breaking into the top 10 for the first time
as the sixth largest acquirer; and First Premier Bank, the former First Interstate of South Dakota. First Premier
entered the merchant acquiring business in 1989 and vaulted from the No. 13 position in 1991 to become the tenth largest
acquirer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two banks are new to the top 25 this year: National Bank of Detroit and Mercantile Bank. Dropping out of the industry's
upper echelon are CFC Financial and MBNA America.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information in this chapter was compiled through direct contact with executives at the acquiring organizations.
In situations where the information was unavailable, estimates were made on the basis of consultation with industry
experts.

The first eight chapters in this book describe the debit business as it is. What about the future? What shape will the
industry take in the years leading up to the turn of the century? To answer these questions, we reprint here a major study
published in 1993 by Faulkner &amp; Gray.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study, ``Debit Card 2000,'' surveyed the 45 largest debit card issuers and the top 35 networks to find out what kind
of growth to expect, what new services and enhancements will arrive, and what developments to look for in national
POS by 2000_just six years away.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the results are surprising, particularly if you've always viewed debit cards as a customer service rather
than a profit center. That's now how issuers and networks in the near future will look at the product. By 2000, they say,
there cold be as many as 1 million POS terminals installed. Visa and MasterCard, meanwhile, predict there'll be 100
million off-line debit cards in force in six years, well beyond today's 15 million.

Ballinger, senior vice president, expects over 80% will have one by 2000. ``We'll never hit 100%, but I would like,
in theory, to have a card in very customer's hands, ``Ballinger says.

Issuers also expect the percentage of consumers with a debit card who use their card at least once a month to grow in the
next seven years. While only about 25% of the issuers say their activation rates currently average more than 70%, 43%
expect that their rates will exceed 70% by 2000. (See tables 6 and 7.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The activation rate continues to creep up, especially as younger users replace older customers,'' says Patricia
Bauer, senior vice president of Minneapolis-based First Bank Systems. U.S. Bancorp's Kresge notes that POS is also
pushing up activation rates with his customers as some who had no use for their debit cards at ATMs find they like using
them at the point of sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like debit cards, new ATM deployment is expected to enjoy only modest growth. About 32% of the networks and 50% of the
issuers expect the number of their ATMs to grow by less than 3% annually, while only 13% of the networks and 5% of the card
issuers expect this growth to exceed 15% annually. (See tables 8 and 9.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few networks and banks, however, are expecting more active new ATM deployment, particularly at off-premise locations.
``We have a tremendous amount of corporate relationships where we can put ATMs in work locations,'' says Fifth Third's
Ballinger. ``We're looking at deploying 25 to 30 ATMs a year in the workplace. Some will pay us to install ATMs so they
can get rid of or cut their cashier functions.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
And some banks note they expect to deploy more new ATMs to perform non-traditional applications beyond cash withdrawals
and accepting deposits. A few innovators already have been deploying advanced ATMs which can cash checks, issue account
statements, sell stamps or allow consumers to apply for bank loans. ``The traditional cash withdrawals and deposit-taking
terminals have leveled off,'' says Edward Gough, president of Ohio-based Money Station network. ``But other ATM
applications such as EBT will push ATM installations for expanded functions that will add to the growth of ATMs.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This projected growth is slightly less than the growth in recent years. In 1993, the number of ATMs in the U.S. grew by
8.6%. It grew by 4.5% in 1992, 4.2% in 1991, 5.9% in 1990 and 4.3% in 1989. (See table 10.) And projected growth is considerably
less than the double-digit growth of the early 1980s.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite modest expectations for debit card and ATM growth, networks and issuers have higher expectations for total
EFT transactions. Executives expect the most growth in POS transactions while seeing growth of only 10% or less for
ATM transactions. The result will be significant overall transaction growth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
About 55% of the network executives and 53% of bank card issuers expect their EFT volume growth to exceed 15% annually.
Another 26% of the issuers and 10% of the networks expect growth to be between 10% and 15% annually. (See tables 11 and
12.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Between now and the end of the decade, the number of POS transactions will equal the number of ATM transactions,''
says Edward Gough, president of Ohio-based Money Station network. ``POS is now only 5% of our total volume.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Others also expect POS to lead the growth. ``We will see a lot of transaction volume growth,'' says Olen Thomas, vice
president of Richmond, VA.-based Crestar Bank. ``The POS component of transaction volume could grow by 50% a year
for the next two to three years.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite modest expectations for ATM transaction growth, network executives say it still will be healthy. ``We keep
expecting the rate of growth in ATM transaction volume to slow, but last year it exploded,'' says James Martin, president
of Wisconsin-based Tyme network. ``In POS, we expect a 55% increase in 1993 and we expect ATM volume to continue to grow
10% a year.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Networks projecting the lowest rate of growth_less than 10%_typically do not offer or plan to offer POS and also do
not have ambitious plans for other new electronic payments programs. These projections would indicate that POS,
which finally seems ready to take off after years of hopeful expectations, will drive EFT volume increases in excess
of the 12% to 14% growth that had been common in recent years. (See table 13.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although POS has been growing slowly in recent years, new regional POS programs throughout the country, the advent
of national POS programs, the skyrocketing level of acceptance of debit cards by supermarkets and penetration of
POS into new markets like fast-food restaurants and specialty shops have raised the expectations of both network
and financial institution executives.

Who owns all those automated-teller machines one sees popping up all over the place? Chances are, the answer is among
this ranking of the top 300 ATM owners in the United States, listed by machines owned as of year-end 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These machine owners control some 47,910 terminals, or 55% of all ATMs. Not all significant ATM deployers are banks.
Among the ranks of machine owners are six non-bank companies: Electronic Data Systems, Affiliated Computer Systems,
Wegmans Food Markets, FIserv, Publix Super Markets, and Delchamps supermarkets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each entry also records how many POS terminals the organization owns. As it happens, the top 300 ATM owners also control
58,100, or 54%, of all U.S. POS devices.

Of course, there is more to debit cards than POS_and the shared regional networks offer it. Here are many of the same
networks from Chapter Two, now ranked according to total transaction volume for September 1993. This ranking thus
includes automated-teller transactions as well as payments at the point of sale, with data on terminals by type_ATM
or POS, including how many ATMS are installed off bank premises in stores, malls, etc._and a breakdown of transactions
into those on ATMs and those on POS terminals. This information is shown for the 50 largest shared regional systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now the value of shared network brands becomes clear. The top-line total-transaction number includes all transactions
deposits, withdrawals, transfers, payments, and balance inquiries) performed on machines hooked into the network
not just those passing through the network's data center. Hence, the number captures a truer sense of the strength
of the network's brand among cardholders than does the number of data-center transactions (which are shown in the
``switch'' line in the transaction analysis).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another such indicator is the interchange percentage, shown in the transaction analysis. This is the portion of total
volume stemming from cardholders' use of terminals belonging to banks other than their own. Banks' fees for so-called
foreign transactions influence interchange, of course, but the number does give some indication of the extent to
which consumers recognize network marks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Networks to watch include number-one Star and second-ranked MAC. Star in 1993 became the first network ever to exceed
the 100-million mark in monthly volume. And MAC, which is part of the giant Electronic Payment Services Inc. electronic
banking combine, logged the fastest growth among the top 50, boosting transactions by 78%. This surge was enough to
move the network up from its fourth-place showing in 1992.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When banks began hooking up their automated teller machines to regional electronic-banking networks back in the
1970s, the eventual use of debit cards to buy things in stores was always uppermost in the minds of bank and network managers
alike.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That next step began in the early '80s. One of the first networks to introduce point-of-sale debit was Iowa's Shazam.
In 1985, California's major banks created Interlink, skipping the ATM stage altogether and going straight to POS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now at least 25 networks offer POS, and the brand identity, single card bases, and machine-sharing these regional
systems bring to the product are helping fuel its remarkable growth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is producing some notable success stories among the networks. The New Jersey-based NYCE network, whose POS program
barely existed two years ago, is installing thousands of terminals a month in supermarkets and other retail locations.
Result: a nearly 600% increase in monthly transactions in one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These 25 networks offering POS, along with Maestro, MasterCard's national POS brand, are ranked here by transaction
volume for June 1993, with details on each system's transactions, terminals, switch fees, cards, and merchant concentration.
Interlink, with its massive programs with such merchants as Lucky and Arco, ranks number one, dwarfing second-ranked
Explore, another California network. NYCE's big growth was enough to boost the network into the number 10 spot.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Look for network mergers to thin these ranks, leading to perhaps 10 or so super-regional systems by the end of the decade.
Fewer brands covering more cards, terminals, and territory should mean accelerated growth for POS.

<DOCTITLE>Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D., of Roslyn, New York, proposing to revoke his DEA
Certificate of Registration, AL0713417, under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), (4), and (5), and deny any pending applications
for registration as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Lehrman
was no longer authorized by state law to handle controlled substances, that his continued registration would be inconsistent
with the public interest, and that he had been excluded from participation in a program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause was sent by registered mail and delivered to Dr. Lehrman on July 9, 1994, at his registered location
in Roslyn, New York. No response was received from Dr. Lehrman or anyone purporting to represent him.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Lehrman has waived his opportunity for a hearing.
The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter, and enters his final order
under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.57.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Lehrman was convicted in the New York State Supreme Court in New York County
of grand larceny in the second degree, conspiracy in the fourth degree, and offering a false instrument for filing
on sixteen occasions. These convictions involved billing for services to the Medicaid program, which services also
included improper prescribing of the Schedule IV controlled substance Valium. On October 20, 1992, the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS) excluded Dr. Lehrman from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs
for a period of twenty five years. This exclusion was mandatory under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(a)
and was due to his conviction of a criminal offense related to the delivery of care under the Medicaid program. On April
9, 1993, the New York Department of Health, Board for Professional Medical Conduct, issued an order revoking Dr. Lehrman's
medical license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator has consistently held that termination of a registrant's state authority to handle controlled
substances requires that DEA revoke the registrant's DEA Certificate of Registration.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
57 FR 22256 (1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Lehrman is not authorized to administer, dispense, prescribe, or otherwise handle controlled substances under
the laws of the state in which he is registered with DEA. In light of this, the Deputy Administrator concludes that it
is not necessary to address the other grounds, including whether Dr. Lehrman's continued registration is consistent
with the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Dr. Lehrman's registration must be revoked. 21 U.S.C.
824(a)(3). Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority
vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate
of Registration, AL0713417, previously issued to Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that
any pending applications for registration, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective August 30, 1994.

of expert judgment), and those features, events, and processes that could pose a serious challenge to Yucca Mountain's
viability as the site of a potential repository. A final round-table discussion will explore the role that natural
and engineered barriers should play in assessing site suitability.

The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was created by Congress in the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987
to evaluate the technical and scientific validity of activities undertaken by the DOE in its program to manage the
disposal of the nation's spent nuclear fuel and defense high-level waste. In that same legislation, Congress directed
the DOE to characterize a site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for its suitability as a potential location for a permanent
repository for the disposal of that waste.

The Office of Information Technology (``OIT'') today announced that the phase-in date for mandated filing on the
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (``EDGAR'') system for registrants in phase-in Groups CF&hyph;05
and IM&hyph;03 will be after November 1, 1994. This will afford OIT staff adequate time to complete its analysis of
the data respecting EDGAR's performance that was collected during the Congressionally-mandated six-month test
period and to report to the Commission. It is anticipated that prior to November 1, 1994, the Commission will announce,
approximately 30 days before effectiveness, a schedule setting out the precise phase-in dates for Groups CF&hyph;05
and IM&hyph;03 and all subsequent phase-in groups. Filers in Groups CF&hyph;05 and IM&hyph;03 who are prepared to
file electronically prior to mandated phase-in may volunteer to do so by requesting that their phase-in group be changed
to CF&hyph;04 or IM&hyph;02, as appropriate. At the time a phase-in group change is granted, filers will become subject
to mandated electronic filing rules and all subsequent filings will be required to be filed in electronic format.
Once a registrant is phased in, third parties filing documents such as Schedules 13D or proxy materials with respect
to that registrant also are required to submit such filings electronically. Corporation Finance registrants requesting
phase-in changes should contact Sylvia Reis or Serena Swegle ((202) 942-2940), Mail Stop 3&hyph;8, Division of Corporation
Finance, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549. Investment Management registrants should contact Anthony A.
Vertuno ((202) 942&hyph;0591) or Ruth Armfield Sanders ((202) 942&hyph;0633), Mail Stop 10&hyph;6, Division of
Investment Management, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549.

The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34416 (July 21, 1994), 59

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex is amending Rule 205: (1) To provide that no differential shall be charged on odd-lot order transactions except
for non-regular way trades; (2) to revise the definition of the effective transaction that triggers the execution
of an odd-lot order with respect to certain odd-lot limited orders; and (3) to delete, reposition, or re-number various
provisions relating to specific types of odd-lot orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current provisions of Rule 205, all standard odd-lot market orders, as well as marketable odd-lot limited
orders, are executed with no differential charged.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 However, a differential may be charged in connection with executions of odd-lot limit orders, market orders to sell
marked ``short,'' stop orders, and other types of orders as specified in Rule 205(B) and (C).

See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Amex Rule 205(B) and (C). Currently, the Rules permits differentials to be charged in connection with buying on the
offer and selling on the bid, limited orders ``with or without sale,'' buying or selling ``or on close,'' buying or
selling ``at the close,'' orders filled after the close, ``seller's option'' trades, and cash trades.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the amendments to Rule 205, the Exchange intends to require the execution of all odd-lot market or limit orders,
except for non-regular way executions, without a differential. Non-regular way trades will include (1) a ``seller's
option'' trade for delivery not less than six business days nor more than sixty days following the day of the contract;
(2) an odd-lot order for cash or ``next day'' delivery, and (3) any order for additional settlement periods as may be
provided under Rule 124 (Types of Bids and Offers). All other odd-lot orders will be executed without a differential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Odd-lot limited orders must be executed on the first eligible effective transaction. Under the current odd-lot pricing
procedures, the effective transaction for a limited order to buy is the first round lot transaction below the specified
limit by the amount of the differential or by a greater amount. Further, the effective transactions for a limited order
to sell marked ``long'' is the first round lot transaction above the specified limit by the amount of the differential
or by a greater amount. Finally, the effective transaction for a limited order to sell marked ``short'' is the first
round lot transaction which is above the specified limit by the amount of the differential or by a greater amount, and
which is also higher than the last different round lot transaction price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the amendments to Rule 205, the effective transaction that will trigger the execution of an odd-lot limited
order is a transaction ``at or lower'' than the specified limit for a buy limited order, or ``at or higher'' than the
specified limit for sell limited orders. In addition, for sell limited orders marked ``short,'' the triggering transaction
must also be higher than the last different round lot transaction (a ``plus'' or ``zero-plus'' tick).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, under the amendments, marketable limited orders will continue to be executed in accordance with the procedures
outlined in Rule 205 applicable to market orders. Currently, any order entered as a limited order, which is marketable
at the time it is entered, is treated exactly as though it were entered as a market order.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, this provision in the amendments is merely a codification of current Exchange practice.

In addition, the amendments delete provisions relating to orders that are infrequently or never entered. These include
(1) limited orders to buy on the offer, sell on the bid, and those marked ``immediate or cancel''; and (2) limited orders
to buy or sell marked ``or on close.''

Finally, current provisions relating to ``seller's option'' or cash trades will be deleted and subsumed by new Section
C(2) entitled ``Non-Regular Way Trades.'' A differential will be permitted on such executions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public. The Commission believes that the proposal's goal, which
is to eliminate odd-lot differentials on all but non-regular way trades and adjust the pricing mechanism accordingly,
should increase the quality of execution and accurate reporting of customer odd-lot market and limited orders. The
Commission also believes that the proposal should further the Commission objective of ensuring that customers receive
the best execution of such orders. As a result of the proposal, the price charged for the execution of systematized
odd-lot orders will reflect the market's price without additional transaction charges.

SUMMARY of application: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants request an amendment to the Prior Order which permits the Fund to offer multiple classes of shares. As amended,
the order would permit the Fund to assess a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') on certain redemptions of
shares. The order also would let applicants add a conversion feature to their existing multiple class distribution
arrangement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Fund is an open-end management investment company, which currently consists of ten series. The series represent
interests in three money market portfolios, four bond portfolios, and three equity portfolios (the ``Portfolios'').
The Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestar Bank, which is a subsidiary of Crestar Financial Corporation.
The Distributor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMR Corp.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Prior Order permits the Fund to issue an unlimited number of classes of shares. The Prior Order recognizes certain
permissible class differences, including: (a) the allocation among classes of certain expenses including 12b&hyph;1
fees and shareholder servicing fees, transfer agency fees, blue sky fees and certain other fees; (b) the fact that
classes will vote separately with respect to the classes' 12b&hyph;1 plans and/or shareholder services plans; (c)
the exchange privileges of the various classes; and (d) the manner in which each class of shares are designated. The
Fund's existing classes of shares are sold subject to a traditional front-end sales load and/or rule 12b&hyph;1 fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants request an exemption to let them impose a CDSC on certain redemptions of shares and waive the CDSC in certain
cases. Applicants also request an exemption to allow them to offer one or more classes of shares with a conversion feature.
Applicants request that the relief apply to all other investment companies or series thereof that are, or in the future
will be, advised by the Adviser, or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser,
or that are, or in the future will be, distributed by the Distributor, or a person controlling, controlled by, or under
common control with the Distributor and that have or will have the ability to issue classes of shares that are identical
in all material respects to those described in the application. All existing entities that presently intend to rely
on the requested order have been named as applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The terms of the CDSC and the circumstances under which it is imposed may vary among the Portfolios and among classes
within a Portfolio. A CDSC may be imposed in combination with an initial sales load, in connection with redemptions
of shares for which an initial sales load was waived, or in connection with redemptions of shares sold at net asset value.
The CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value
of the shares at the time of purchase or redemption. No CDSC will be imposed on amounts representing capital appreciation
or shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gain distributions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicants request the ability to waive or reduce the CDSC. In waiving or reducing a CDSC, the Fund will comply with
the requirements of rule 22d&hyph;1. Applicants may provide a credit in the amount of the CDSC to a shareholder who
reinvests in Fund shares within a certain period after redemption. Any credit will be paid by the Distributor or the
Adviser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Shareholders may be permitted to exchange shares subject to a CDSC for shares of the same class of another Portfolio
and for shares of the money market Portfolios. Any exchange privilege will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicants may offer one or more classes of shares subject to a conversion feature. After the expiration of a specified
period, shares of one class (``Purchase Class'') automatically will convert at their net asset value to shares of
another class with different features (``Target Class''). After conversion, the Target Class shares will be subject
to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee, if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales
charge and service fee of the Purchase Class.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants believe that the proposal to impose a CDSC is fair, in the public interest and the interest of the Fund's
shareholders, and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and
the provisions of the Act. Consequently, applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption
from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to the extent necessary
to permit the proposed CDSC arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants also request an amendment to the Prior Order to let them add a conversion feature as a difference between
the classes of shares. Applicants believe that the conversion feature is equitable and will not discriminate against
any group of shareholders.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that the following conditions may be imposed in any SEC order granting the requested relief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each class of shares of a Portfolio will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments and be identical
in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of a Portfolio will relate
solely to one or more of the following: (a) the method of financing certain class expenses, which are limited to any
or all of the following: (i) transfer agent fees identified by applicants as being attributable to a specific class
of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder
reports, prospectuses and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) SEC and/or Blue Sky
registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required
to support the shareholders of a specific class; (v) directors' fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating
to one class of shares; and (vi) accounting expenses relating to one class of shares; (b) expenses assessed to a class
pursuant to a shareholder services plan and/or 12b&hyph;1 plan (whether an administrative 12b&hyph;1 plan or a distribution
and service plan or both) with respect to such class; (c) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect
to the Fund's shareholder services plan and/or any 12b&hyph;1 plan (except as set forth in condition 16 below); (d)
the different exchange privileges of the classes of shares; (e) the designation of each class of shares of the Fund;
and (f) the fact that certain classes will have a conversion feature. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically
identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares
shall not be so allocated unless and until approved by the SEC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The directors of the Fund, including a majority of the independent directors, will approve the offering of additional
classes of new shares (the ``Multi-Class System''). The minutes of the meetings of the directors regarding the deliberations
of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail
the reasons for the directors' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interest of both
the Fund and its shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of directors, including a majority of the independent
directors. Any persons authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to
meet class expenses shall provide to the board of directors, and the directors shall review at least quarterly, a written
report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Fund, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the classes of shares. The
directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Distributor and the Adviser will be responsible for reporting
any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Distributor and the Adviser, at their
own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors.
Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Fund to agree to conform to such standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1
(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders
need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The directors will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the shareholder
services plans and any 12b&hyph;1 plans and the related service agreements complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii)
of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable
to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged
to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors
to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based,
will be subject to the review and approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Dividends paid by the Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount per outstanding share, except that
administrative or service payments made by a class under a plan and any class expenses will be borne exclusively by
that class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes
and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered
a report to the applicants that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and
allocations would be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute
Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review,
will render at least annually a report to the Fund that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The
reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to section 30(a) and 30(b)(1)
of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Fund (which the Fund
agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon written request to the Fund for such work
papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director,
the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, and Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate
and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on the ``Design of
a System'' and ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating
effectiveness'' as defined and described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted
by the AICPA from time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends and distribution of the classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses among the classes and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred
to in condition 9 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 9 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective
action if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The prospectuses of each class of shares will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other
person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation
with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
with respect to the Multi-Class Systems will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the directors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. The Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The Fund will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain in the statement of assets and liabilities and the statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent that any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares of a Portfolio, it will also disclose the respective
expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares of such Portfolio. The information provided
by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Fund's net asset value or public offering
price will present each class of shares separately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply SEC approval,
authorization of, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Fund may make pursuant to its administrative
12b&hyph;1 plan, distribution and service plan or shareholder services plan in reliance on the exemptive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Any Purchase Class with a conversion feature will convert into a Target Class on the basis of the relative net asset
values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted
shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III,
Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales
charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. If the Fund implements any amendment to a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the Target Class shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class will stop converting into Target Class
shares unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. If such approval
is not granted, the directors shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares
are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to
the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such Purchase Class shares
previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement
the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase
Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class will
convert into New Target Class. A New Target Class or New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief.
Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in any manner that the directors reasonably
believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with
the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser
and/or the Distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target
Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and
the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosure in an effective registration statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16169 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Partnership is a California limited partnership with an investment objective of seeking capital appreciation
through investment in publicly-traded equity securities. It allows investors to purchase and redeem Partnership
interests (the ``Units'') at net asset value on a monthly basis. The Partnership is not registered under the Act in
reliance on section 3(c)(1) of the Act. The offerings of the Units were structured as private placements under section
4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Units are sold to institutional investors
and high net worth individuals.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. TAMCO and the Adviser are wholly-owned subsidiaries of The TCW Group, Inc. TAMCO serves as the sole general partner
and administrator of the Partnership. TAMCO also manages the Partnership's investments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Company, a Maryland corporation, is a registered open-end investment company formed as a series company. Currently,
the Company offers ten portfolios. The Company proposes to offer a new investment portfolio (the ``Fund''), whose
investment objectives and policies will be substantially similar to those of the Partnership. The Company has entered
into an advisory agreement with the Adviser who will provide investment management services to the Fund that are substantially
the same as the services that TAMCO currently provides to the Partnership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants propose that, pursuant to an agreement and plan of exchange, the Fund acquire substantially all of the
assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the Partnership in exchange for Fund shares (the ``Exchange'').
Prior to the Exchange, information and a prospectus will be delivered to the Partnership's limited partners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Fund shares received by the Partnership will have an aggregate net asset value equivalent to the net asset value
of the assets transferred by the Partnership (except for the effect of organizational expenses paid by the Fund).
Upon consummation of an Exchange, the Partnership will distribute the Fund shares to its partners, with each partner
receiving shares having an aggregate net asset value equivalent to the net asset value of the Units held by such partner
prior to the Exchange (except for the effect of organizational expenses paid by the Fund). The Partnership may retain
assets needed to pay any accrued expenses. The Partnership also may retain assets that the Fund is not permitted to
purchase, or that would be unsuitable for the Fund. Assets retained by the Partnership that are not needed to pay accrued
expenses will be distributed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to the partners of the Partnership. The Partnership will be liquidated and dissolved following the distribution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The agreement governing the Partnership provides that the Partnership may be converted into a registered investment
company if the general partner determines that a conversion is in the best interest of the Partnership. The agreement
expressly provides that no further approval or consent of the limited partners is required for such conversion, so
long as at least 60 days' advance written notice is provided to the limited partners. Limited partners who do not wish
to participate in the conversation of the Partnership will have adequate opportunity to redeem their Partnership
interests before the conversion occurs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The expenses of the Exchange will be borne by TAMCO. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be
paid in connection with the Exchange. Fund organizational expenses, up to a maximum of $50,000, will be paid by the
Fund and amortized over five years. Fund organizational expenses in excess of $50,000 will be paid by the Adviser.
Any unamortized organizational expenses associated with the organization of a Fund at the time the Adviser withdraws
its initial investment in the Company will be borne by the Adviser and not the Fund.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. The management fees for the Fund will not exceed the maximum fees currently paid by the Partnership. Applicants
expect that other Fund expenses will be relatively higher than Partnership expenses. This is primarily because of
the increased operating costs of a registered investment company and compliance with additional regulatory requirements.
Through the end of calendar 1994, however, the Adviser will limit annual Fund expenses with the intention of capping
fund expense ratios at levels which would have been incurred during 1994 by the partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Prior to an Exchange, certain limited partners may withdraw from the Partnership and participate in a new limited
partnership with similar investment objectives. The new limited partnership will not be registered under the Act
in reliance on section 3(c)(1) thereof, and the new partnership interests will not be registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 in reliance on section 4(2) thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Fund's board of directors and TAMCO have considered whether the Exchange will be in the best interests of the
Company and the Partnership, respectively. All of the members of the Fund's board and TAMCO have approved the Exchange
and have concluded that: (a) the Exchange is desirable as a business matter for both the Company and the Partnership;
(b) the Exchange is in the best interests of the Company and the Partnership; (c) the Exchange is reasonable and fair,
does not involve overreaching, and is consistent with the policies of the Act; (d) the Exchange is consistent with
the policies of the Company and the Partnership; and (e) the interests of existing shareholders in the Company and
existing partners will not be diluted as a result of the Exchange. The Exchange will not be effected until the Company
has received a favorable opinion of counsel with respect to the tax consequences of the Exchange.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 17(a) prohibits affiliated persons of a registered investment company, or affiliated persons of such
persons, from selling to or purchasing from such company any security or other property. The Partnership may be an
affiliated person of the Company because TAMCO and the Adviser are under common control. Thus, the proposed Exchange
may be prohibited by section 17(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 17(b) of the Act permits the SEC to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes
that (a) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair
and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with
the policy of the registered investment company concerned; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the
general purposes of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Exchange will permit partners to pursue the same investment objectives and policies as shareholders of the
Fund without sacrificing the pass-through tax features of the Partnership. In addition, shareholders of the Fund
will be able to purchase and redeem shares on each business day, as opposed to only once per month as is currently provided
under the Partnership agreement, providing greater liquidity. The Fund expects that operating as a registered investment
company will help encourage net asset growth. For these reasons, among others, applicants believe that the proposed
Exchange meets the section 17(b) standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The first two meetings will be held in New Orleans, LA, and Washington, DC. The purpose of the meetings is to discuss
the Coast Guard's implementation plan, and to obtain input from and educate the affected community and general public
with regard to revised procedures and planned innovations. The planned centralization is part of the Coast Guard's
ongoing efforts to provide the maximum service to the maritime community, while seeking to reduce costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The implementation plan describes in general terms the steps and procedures which the Coast Guard will follow in achieving
centralization while maintaining full customer service.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vessel Documentation is a form of national registration for vessels, which among other things, serve to establish
a vessel's nationality and qualification to be employed in specified trades. The benefits of documenting a vessel
are practical, legal and financial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The salient practical benefit of documentation is to ensure unencumbered interstate and international commerce.
The existence of a Federal system of documentation serves to preempt state numbering and regulatory schemes, with
the result that a vessel operated under a Federal endorsement is ensured access to state waters for various activities.
Another practical benefit of Federal documentation stems from the preferential customs and tax treatment accorded
to ``vessels of the United States''. Established national policy seeks to promote the existence of an American merchant
marine as a resource to be drawn upon in time of emergency or war. To the extent that documentation is a condition precedent
to the receipt of preferential customs and tax treatment, it serves as a tool to promote national policy interests.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legal benefits of documentation include establishing conclusive evidence of nationality for international
purposes, thereby conferring the privileges, protections, and immunities contemplated by long-standing international
law and custom. Vessels on the high seas which are not registered in a national system may be deemed to be ``stateless''
vessels, subject to boarding by foreign authorities without restriction. Another legal benefit conferred by documentation
is the establishment of entitlement to engage in certain restricted trades and employments, such as coastwise or
Great Lakes trade, the U.S. fisheries, towing, and dredging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major financial benefit conferred by documentation is preferred mortgage financing. The availability of capital
for maritime financing often hinges upon the existence of the preferred mortgage as security for loans against vessels.
Unlike so-called ``ordinary mortgages,'' preferred mortgages rise to the level of a maritime lien, thereby taking
precedence over non-maritime liens as well as maritime liens which arise after perfection of the preferred mortgage.
Preferred mortgages, which are enforceable against the vessel in Federal court wherever the vessel is found are critical
not only for large commercial vessels, but also provide protection for mortgages of recreational vessels, thereby
helping to ensure the continued existence of the recreational vessel building industry in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose of Centralization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vessel documentation program has grown exponentially during the course of recent years. The Coast Guard has identified
centralization as a means by which it can meet the challenge of maintaining and improving levels of service to its customers
through significant gains in functional and administrative practices. No longer will it be necessary for members
of industry, law enforcement officials, and the boating public to make inquiries at multiple points to receive information
on documented vessels. Mortgagees and lien claimants will have a single point for filing instruments. Inconsistencies
that result from interpretation of statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements at multiple points would be eliminated.
Workloads will be evenly distributed so that backlogs caused by seasonal fluctuations in maritime activities could
be reduced or eliminated. The impact of absence of personnel due to retirement, illness, or unforeseen circumstances
will be minimized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With all records consolidated, it will be feasible to develop a system permitting the public to file instruments through
electronic means, thus enhancing vessel financing by permitting instantaneous perfection of mortgages and related
instruments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management overhead will be reduced through better space management by eliminating duplicate facilities in 14 locations.
Moreover, most offices are currently located in high cost areas; consolidation will make it possible to locate all
facilities in an area with lower real estate costs for the government.

The apportionment ratio between gas and liquid, as shown below, is a result of the increased program resources dedicated
to the hazardous liquid program due to: (1) environmental requirements following passage of the Pipeline Safety
Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;508); and (2) the Secretary's environmental action plan instituted following a serious
hazardous liquid spill in Fairfax County, Virginia in March 1993.

The Commission will consider whether to propose amendments regarding limited partnership roll-up transactions
that would implement the provisions of the Limited Partnership Rollup Reform Act of 1993 (``Act''). The proposed
amendments would revise the current definition of ``roll-up transaction'' in Regulation S&hyph;K to conform more
closely to the definition of that term in the Act, and would add to the Commission's rules certain disclosure and other
requirements with respect to roll-up transactions. For further information, please contact Robert B. Toomey at

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed and is requesting public comments on a comprehensive,
multimedia Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy. The proposed Strategy describes specific actions that
EPA will take to reduce environmental and human health risks associated with contaminated sediment. The Strategy
does not propose new regulation. EPA is acting, under existing statutory and regulatory authority, to implement
policies to consistently assess, prevent, and remediate contaminated sediment. Because the proposed Strategy
is a unique plan of action developed to address a significant national environmental problem, and to streamline decision-making
within and among EPA programs, the Agency is taking the unusual step of requesting public comment on this internal
EPA work plan.

Contaminated sediment poses ecological and human health risks in many watersheds throughout the United States.
In these watersheds, sediment serves as a contaminant reservoir from which fish and bottom dwelling organisms can
accumulate toxic compounds and pass them up the food chain. Sediment contaminants can be passed to larger fish, birds,
and mammals until they accumulate to levels that may be toxic to humans. Toxic chemicals in sediment come from discharges
of industrial waste and sewage; stormwater runoff from waste dumps, city streets and farms, and air pollutants contained
in rainwater. The magnitude of the toxics problem in the United States is evidenced in more than 1,200 State advisories
that have been issued against consuming fish that have accumulated toxic bioaccumulative contaminants from sediment
and other sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More than ten Federal statutes provide authority to many EPA program offices to address the problem of contaminated
sediment. This has resulted in fragmented, and in some cases duplicative, efforts to complete the necessary research,
technology development, and pollution control activities required to effectively manage contaminated sediment.
Often it has been difficult for EPA programs to agree upon the fundamental question of whether sediment at a particular
site poses ecological or human health risks. EPA's proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy was developed
to streamline decision-making within and among the Agency's program offices by promoting and ensuring: the use of
consistent sediment assessment practices, consistent consideration of risks posed by contaminated sediment,
the use of consistent approaches to management of contaminated sediment risks, and the wise use of scarce resources
for research and technology development.

Goals of the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy describes actions that the Agency will take to accomplish
the following four strategic goals: (1) Prevent further sediment contamination that may cause unacceptable ecological
or human health risks; (2) When practical, clean up existing sediment contamination that adversely affects the Nation's
waterbodies or their uses, or that causes other significant effects on human health or the environment; (3) Ensure
that sediment dredging and dredged material disposal continue to be managed in an environmentally sound manner;
(4) develop and consistently apply methodologies for analyzing contaminated sediments.

What the Strategy Does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy is comprised of six component sections: assessment, prevention,
remediation, dredged material management, research, and outreach. In each section, EPA describes actions that
the Agency will take to accomplish the four broad strategic goals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the assessment section of the Strategy EPA proposes that Agency program offices all use standard sediment toxicity
test methods and chemical-specific sediment quality criteria to determine whether sediments are contaminated.
Actions that EPA will take to develop a national inventory of sites and sources of sediment contamination (the National
Sediment Inventory) are described in the assessment section of the proposed Strategy. The National Sediment Inventory
will be used by EPA to target sites for contaminated sediment assessment, prevention, and remediation. These assessment
actions will enable EPA to focus on cleaning up the most contaminated waterbodies, and ensuring that further sediment
contamination is prevented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's plan to stop sediment contaminants from reaching the environment is described in the prevention section of
the proposed Strategy. In order to regulate the use of pesticides and toxic substances that accumulate in sediment,
EPA proposes the use of acute sediment toxicity tests to support registration of chemicals under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act. In the prevention section of the Strategy EPA
also proposes: developing effluent guidelines for industries that discharge sediment contaminants in significant
amounts; using pollution prevention policies to reduce or eliminate sediment contamination resulting from noncompliance
with permits; preparing guidelines for design of new chemicals to reduce bioavailability and partitioning of toxic
chemicals to sediment; and implementing point and nonpoint source controls that will protect sediment quality.
EPA's prevention actions will stop further contamination of sediment and reduce ecological and human health risks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the remediation section of the Strategy EPA proposes using multiple statutes to require contaminated sediment
remediation by parties responsible for pollution. These statutes include the Comprehensive Emergency Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Water Act
(CWA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Rivers and Harbors Act, and the Oil Pollution Act. EPA states in
the proposed Strategy, however, that the Agency will not proceed with a clean-up if a combination of pollution prevention
and source controls will allow the sediments to recover naturally in an acceptable period of time. EPA's remediation
actions will clean up existing sediment contamination that adversely affects the Nation's waterbodies.

In the dredged material management section of the proposed Strategy, EPA discusses the development of technical
guidance regarding dredged material testing, dredged material disposal site selection, and disposal alternatives.
EPA actions described in the proposed Strategy will ensure continued disposal of dredged material in an environmentally
sound manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the research section of the Strategy, EPA proposes a program of investigative research that is needed to: develop
and validate new chemical-specific sediment criteria and other sediment assessment methods; improve EPA's understanding
of the transfer of sediment contaminants through the food chain; and develop and evaluate a range of technologies
for remediating contaminated sediments. EPA's proposed research program will support improved assessment, prevention,
and remediation of contaminated sediment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The outreach section of the proposed Strategy describes actions that EPA will take to demonstrate, through public
involvement, the Agency's commitment to, and accountability for, sediment management efforts. EPA will produce,
and make available to the public, regular status reports on sediment management activities.

Next Steps Toward Implementation of a Federal Agency Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will begin to track activities of the Agency's program offices as they implement the Contaminated Sediment Management
Strategy. However, EPA envisions that this internal strategy will also be the keystone of a much larger Federal Government
strategy for the management of contaminated sediment. The Water Resources Development Act of 1992 (WRDA 92) requires
a National Contaminated Sediment Task Force to advise the Federal Government on the extent and severity of sediment
contamination; sediment restoration methods and technologies; prevention and source control measures; and long-term
disposal sites for contaminated dredged material. The EPA Administrator and the Secretary of the Army will convene
the Task Force and submit the Agency's Strategy to the Task Force for use in developing a Federal agency contaminated
sediment management strategy. The Task Force can build upon EPA's coordinated research program, the research of
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
and other Federal agencies to improve methodologies for measuring ecological and human health risks from contaminated
sediment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's National Sediment Inventory is a repository of sediment monitoring data generated by Federal agencies to identify
contaminated sediment sites. This data base can be used by Federal, State, and local agencies to focus their pollution
prevention and remediation efforts on the worst sites of sediment contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy addresses coordination of EPA Regional and Headquarters roles
in the management of dredged material, and describes ongoing regulatory development activities related to dredged
material management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Strategy will help facilitate the coordination of dredged material management activities among Federal agencies
and nongovernmental organizations. Coordination of dredged material management activities has been called for
in the May 1994 options paper drafted by the Federal Interagency Working Group on the Dredging Process. The Working
Group was convened by the Secretary of Transportation in the Fall of 1993. The Group has held a series of outreach sessions
throughout the country to solicit ideas on improving the dredging process. The Working Group identified a number
of options to improve the dredging process. Some of these options include: enhanced research and monitoring to improve
dredged material disposal decisionmaking, identification of opportunities to control sources of sediment contaminants,
and effective education and communication with the public on the risks and impacts associated with dredged material
disposal. The proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy addresses all of these issues. It describes a
plan for research on interpretation of bioaccumulation and chronic toxicity tests and dredged material disposal
site assessment. It provides a plan for identification and control of sources of sediment contaminants. It also proposes
effective ways of interacting with the public.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All EPA program offices will use standard sediment testing methods to determine whether sediments are contaminated.
The Office of Water will use standard sediment toxicity and bioaccumulation test methods for monitoring, interpretation
of narrative water quality standards, and dredged material disposal testing. The Office of Pesticide Programs and
the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics will use standard sediment toxicity tests to assess the toxicity of
pesticides and chemicals when registering or reregistering these chemicals for manufacture and use. The Office
of Emergency and Remedial Response will use standard sediment toxicity and bioaccumulation test methods for Superfund
Remedial Investigation/Feasibility studies. The Office of Solid Waste will use biological sediment toxicity test
methods for assessing and monitoring hazardous waste facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, EPA program offices have not yet detailed how they will use sediment quality criteria. This information will
be documented in a Sediment Quality Criteria User's Guide which is currently under development. The general decisions
on how criteria will be used are described in the Strategy. All EPA programs conducting sediment monitoring can use
the criteria to interpret sediment chemistry data. Upon promulgation, the criteria can be adopted as State water
quality standards and used to set National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit limits. The criteria
can also be used with other information to make site-specific decisions concerning corrective action at hazardous
waste facilities, and to assess Superfund sites. The criteria can also be used to evaluate dredged material suitability
for disposal in open water. As soon as EPA's Sediment Quality Criteria User's Manual is drafted, it will be noticed
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public review and comment. In the interim, the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy will be implemented
using the standardized biological assessment methods already available for the program offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Sediment Inventory will be used by EPA program offices as an assessment tool. The inventory will be used
to: identify contaminated sediment sites for consideration for remedial action; target facilities for possible
injunctive relief or supplemental enforcement projects; identify problem pesticides and toxic substances that
may require further regulation or be targeted for enforcement action; identify impaired waters for National Water
Quality Inventory reports or development of Total Maximum Daily Loads; target watersheds for nonpoint source management
practices; and to help select industries for effluent guidelines development.

In order to regulate the use of pesticides that may accumulate to toxic levels in sediment, EPA intends to propose that
acute sediment toxicity tests be included in procedures required to support registration, reregistration, and
special review of pesticides likely to sorb to sediment. In fiscal year 1995, EPA will propose incorporating acute
toxicity bioassays and spiking protocols into the Agency's pesticide assessment guidelines (40 CFR Part 158). To
prevent other toxic substances from accumulating in sediment, EPA will also propose incorporating acute sediment
toxicity tests and sediment bioaccumulation tests into routine chemical review processes required under the Toxic
Substances Control Act. In addition, EPA intends to call for the development of EPA guidelines for design of new chemicals
to reduce bioavailability and partitioning of toxic chemicals to sediment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance will take action to prevent sediment contamination by negotiating,
in cases of noncompliance with permits, enforceable settlement agreements to require source recycling and source
reduction activities. The Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance will also monitor the progress of Federal
facilities toward the goal of halving toxic emissions by the year 1999, and will monitor the reporting of toxic releases
to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Office of Water, and other EPA program offices, will work with nongovernmental organizations and the States
to prevent point and nonpoint source contaminants from accumulating in sediments. EPA will: (1) promulgate new and
revised best available technology effluent guidelines for industries that discharge sediment contaminants in
significant amounts; (2) encourage the States to use biological sediment test methods to interpret water quality
standards, and to adopt sediment quality criteria as water quality standards; (3) encourage the States to develop
Total Maximum Daily Loads for impaired watersheds specifying point and nonpoint source load reductions necessary
to protect sediment quality; (4) use the National Sediment Inventory to target active point sources of sediment contaminants
for permit compliance tracking, (5) ensure that discharges from CERCLA sites and RCRA facilities subject to NPDES
permits comply with permit requirements that protect sediment quality; (6) use the National Sediment Inventory
to target watersheds where technical assistance and grants would effectively be used to reduce nonpoint source loads
of sediment contaminants.

The National Sediment Inventory will be used by EPA's Office of Water, Office of Emergency and Remedial Response,
Office of Solid Waste, and Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance to help target sites for enforcement action
requiring contaminated sediment remediation. EPA's standard sediment toxicity and bioaccumulation tests will
be used to identify sites for remediation, assist in determining clean-up goals for contaminated sites, and to monitor
the effectiveness of remedial actions.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that a small percentage of the total volume of sediment dredged for navigational
channel maintenance requires special handling due to the presence of toxics. The National Sediment Inventory will
be used to identify sites where dredged material may be contaminated. EPA standard sediment toxicity and bioaccumulation
tests are now used in dredged material testing.

EPA's Office of Research and Development, through its Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program, will continue
to collect new chemical and biological data on sediment quality. These data will be included in the Agency's National
Sediment Inventory. EPA's Office of Research and Development will also develop: new biological methods to assess
the ecological and human health effects of sediment contaminants, chemical-specific sediment quality criteria,
methods to conduct sediment toxicity identification evaluations, dredged material disposal fate and transport
models, sediment wasteload allocation models, and technologies for remediation of contaminated sediment.
