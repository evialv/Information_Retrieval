SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) hereby amends the Common Crop Insurance Regulations. The number of
years a policy does not earn a premium without policy termination is changed from one year to three years. The intended
effect of this amendment is to allow a producer to rotate crops without policy cancellation. The arbitration procedures
are amended to apply to all disagreements on factual determinations and be in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association. Currently, the arbitration procedures apply only to disagreement on production to be
counted. The intended effect of this amendment is to broaden the applicability of arbitration procedures to other
possible disagreements under such policies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation
1512&hyph;1. This action constitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of these regulations
under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is November 1, 1999.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A summary of this rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to be determined if it meets the
requirements of a ``significant regulation'' as defined by Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12612, Federalism. This rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. The policies and procedures contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects
on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various
levels of government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) these regulations will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulatory revision is limited to reinsured companies and their
agents and crop producers insured under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.). Therefore,
this action is determined to be exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and no Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis was prepared.

This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24,
1983.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of General Counsel has certified to OMB that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided
in subsections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this rule will preempt state and local
laws to the extent such state and local laws are inconsistent herewith. The administrative appeal provisions located
at 7 CFR part 400, subpart J must be exhausted before judicial action may be brought.

This final rule implements Section 843 of Public Law 102&hyph;190, ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Years 1992&hyph;1993,'' December 5, 1991. It expands military whistleblower protection to those who make disclosures
to an audit, inspection, investigation or law enforcement organization, as well as to an Inspector General or a Member
of Congress. This rule also specifies that reprisal for whistleblowing is punishable under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice and removes 32 CFR part 98a.

It has been certified that this rule is not a significant regulation action. The rule does not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because this rule
does not exert a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is made
based on the fact that the rule merely modifies the current regulation to ensure that policy and procedures with regard
to military whistleblower protection conform with the requirements under 10 U.S.C. 1034. These procedures involve
reporting and investigating allegations of reprisal for protected disclosures made by military members of the armed
forces to appropriate authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been certified that 32 CFR parts 92 and 98a do not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520).

by a DoD civilian employee is punishable under regulations governing disciplinary or adverse action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On receipt of a report of investigation from the IG, DoD, that concludes that a member suffered reprisal, and when

an application to the BCMR may be sought from the legal office supporting the member's command.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Ensure that the Military Department IG:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For all other investigations of alleged reprisal against a member for making or preparing a protected disclosure,
on completion of the investigation, informs the member in writing of the results of the investigation. This may be
accomplished by providing the member a thorough summary of the investigative report or a copy of the investigative
report, edited as necessary under 32 CFR part 285. The information provided to the member must contain a summary of
the material evidence and an analysis of that evidence that supports the determination of whether reprisal occurred.
Regardless of the form of communication, the information provided must be in sufficient detail to allow the member
to pursue the issue further.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) At the request of a BCMR, submits a copy of that investigative report to the BCMR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

to ensure proper presentation of the legal issues in the case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart establishes restrictions governing the operation of unauthorized vehicles, motorized and non-motorized,
on the army training areas of Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, as defined in &sect;552.134 of this subpart. Unauthorized
vehicles are restricted to paved roads on the installation of Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) These restrictions are established to prevent the interruption of the use of these Army training areas by any person
or persons. The continued and uninterrupted use of these training areas by the military is vital in order to maintain
and improve the combat readiness of the U.S. Armed Forces. Training conditions exist within these areas which could
be dangerous to unauthorized persons entering these areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition, these restrictions have been established to prevent property damage, threatening of endangered
flora and fauna in the areas, and to prevent the harassment of protected species such as the Blue Heron and the Indiana
Bat by any person or persons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A special local regulation is being adopted for the We Love Erie Days Fireworks display. This event will be held on Lake
Erie, Erie Harbor, Erie, PA on August 21, 1994. Due to the large number of spectator vessels and the falling ash and debris
from the fireworks display, this regulation is needed to provide for the safety of life, limb, and property on navigable
waters during the event. This regulation will restrict general navigation on Lake Erie, Erie Harbor, Erie, PA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth
Coast Guard District, until July 15, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish a proposed rule in
advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The We Love Erie Days Fireworks display will be conducted on Lake Erie, Erie Harbor, Erie, PA on August 21, 1994. This
regulation will restrict general navigation on Lake Erie, Erie Harbor, in a 300 foot circular zone, surrounding the
Erie Sand and Gravel Pier. This event will have an unusually large concentration of spectator vessels and falling
ash and debris, which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. This regulation is necessary to ensure the protection
of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during this event. Any vessels desiring to transit the regulated area
may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast Guard Station Erie, PA).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c

Economic Assessment and Certification

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary.

At the request of the Galveston County Navigation District No. 1, the Coast Guard is changing the regulation governing
the operation of the bascule span Pelican Island Causeway Bridge across the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, mile 356.1
at Galveston, Texas. The draw will no longer be closed to navigation on Saturday from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., 12 noon to 1
p.m. and 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. but will open on demand. The draw will continue to be closed to navigation during those
hours Monday thru Fridays, except Federal holidays.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon request by the bridge owner, the closure hours of this bridge are being changed to create a better balance between
the needs of vehicular traffic and the needs of navigational traffic. Vehicular traffic across the bridge on Saturdays
has decreased while navigational traffic has remained the same. The closure of the draw is no longer necessary on Saturdays.
This change in the closure hours of the bridge is less restrictive on navigational traffic and will not significantly
affect vehicular traffic. For these reasons, the Coast Guard for good cause finds, under 5 U.S.C. &sect;553(b)(B)
that notice and public procedure on the notice are unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040); February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic
impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632). This rule will have little impact on either vehicular or navigational traffic. Because it expects
the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted,
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1 (series), this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Cape Fear and Northeast Cape Fear Rivers carry commercial and public vessels laden with increasing of amounts
hazardous materials. The area is also experiencing rapid growth in the recreational vessel, barge, and other maritime
traffic. The hazards of the materials transported range from fire and explosion to public health hazards. These materials,
essential to the military, and to the petrochemical and textile industries are routinely transported in a safe manner.
However, maritime traffic which could interfere with the safe movement of a vessel carrying hazardous materials
would create a condition of unacceptable risk to the maritime community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shipping channel within the rivers is normally only 400 feet wide and maneuvering room for a deep draft vessel is
limited. Additionally, most of the facilities which handle these materials are about 30 miles upstream from the mouth
of the river.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety zone will be enacted by a Broadcast Notice to Mariners prior to the vessel's arrival into the river and will
be terminated by another broadcast.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maritime traffic will not be significantly impacted because of the small percentage of vessels needing this safety
zone, and the limited duration of the zone, typically less than three hours during transit and only for initial hookups
and cargo operations. Other piloted commercial traffic would not normally be affected because meeting situations
between two piloted vessels are not normally scheduled by the pilots. Other commercial traffic not under a pilot's
control would be regulated and safe passage would be arranged by the vessel identified in the safety zone, Coast Guard
enforcement personnel, and the non-piloted commercial vessel's master. Recreational vessels would be directed
to the safe limits of the river out of the zone while the vessel passed and would be able to resume normal operation when
the vessel identified in the safety zone has passed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual dates this safety zone would be in effect are not known at this time, but the public will be given notice through
a Broadcast Notice to Mariners when the Captain of the Port Wilmington invokes the safety zone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This safety zone is needed to protect the public from the hazards associated with the passage of these vessels as well
as the movement of other maritime traffic around these vessels.

Regulatory Evaluation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because it expects the impact of this rule to be so minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this rule consistent with section 2.B.2.c of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B (National Environmental Protection Act), and actions to protect the public safety have been
determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the provisions of the CAA, as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses
so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emissions
of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate
such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these
requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical
and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally
approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report
to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title
V of the CAA. In February 1992, the EPA issued ``Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air
Act Amendments'', in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as
a tool to provide further guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Texas submitted a SIP revision to the EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order to
gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following three PROGRAM elements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance
to small businesses;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Region used section 507 of the CAA when reviewing the State submittal for approvability. The SIP revision, discussed
in detail in the Technical Support Document, is briefly outlined below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Procedural Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Texas has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required
PROGRAM elements. The Texas Clean Air Act (TCAA), TEXAS HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE ANN. (Vernon 1992), &sect;382.0365,
``Small Business Stationary Source Assistance Program'', enacted by the Texas 1991 legislative session and effective
September 1991, provides authority for the State to establish a PROGRAM (SIP Appendix A). Included in &sect;382.0365
of the TCAA are provisions establishing an SBAP, establishing the SBAP's duties and responsibilities, creating
a State ombudsman, creating a CAP, establishing membership of the CAP, and establishing CAP duties. In addition,
the State of Texas has the legal authority necessary to implement the control strategies for the PROGRAM in compliance
with the CAA and the EPA requirements under the provisions of the TCAA, &sect;&sect;382.0365(f) and 382.017. The
Texas Small Business Ombudsman, Small Business Advocate's Office, is located at the central offices of the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), Office of Air Quality, [formerly the Texas Air Control Board
(TACB)], in Austin, Texas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State conducted public hearings on September 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10, 1992, to consider public comments on the proposed
PROGRAM, which will amend the Texas SIP to add a revision entitled, ``Revisions to the State Implementation Plan for
the Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program, Texas Air Control
Board''. The proposed SIP revision was formally adopted November 6, 1992, by the TACB. The Texas PROGRAM was submitted
to the EPA by the Governor of Texas on November 13, 1992 (received November 16, 1992) as a revision to the Texas SIP. It
was initially reviewed for completeness and was determined complete on January 15, 1993. The submittal was then reviewed
for approvability by the EPA Region 6 and EPA Headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 1, 1993, the TACB merged with the Texas Water Commission to form the TNRCC and is now called the Office of
Air Quality within the TNRCC. The merger did not abrogate, void, or rescind any rules, regulations, Orders, permits,
or any other action previously taken by the former TACB.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first PROGRAM element is the establishment of a SBAP to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in its narrative SIP revision, under subsection I.A.3.c),
entitled ``Establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP)'', to establish a SBAP in the TACB, Program
Development Division. In order to establish this PROGRAM element, &sect;382.0365(a) and (b) of the TCAA were enacted
and provide the legal authority requiring for establishment of the SBAP with responsibilities consistent with the
six requirements in title V of the Federal CAA. The SBAP will provide sufficient services to small businesses through
the development, collection, and dissemination of information to small businesses on matters of (1) Determining
applicable requirements under the CAA and permit issuance; (2) the rights and obligations of small businesses under
the CAA; (3) compliance methods and acceptable control technologies; (4) pollution prevention and accidental release
prevention and detection; and (5) audit programs. (Details are presented in the EPA's Technical Support Document
and the State's submittal.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the State must meet to have an approvable SBAP. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for
developing, collecting, and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small
business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons
to further compliance with the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A seventh requirement of section 507(a), establishment of an Ombudsman office, is discussed in the next section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State has met this requirement. The SBAP will provide a system for developing, collecting, and coordinating information
on compliance methods and technologies. Data bases and experts in different areas will provide definitive guidance
information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SBAP will include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Methods for disseminating technical and compliance information to small businesses: The SBAP will act as an information
clearinghouse by referring small businesses to State technical experts, specifically trained to handle specific
questions relevant to achieving compliance with the CAA. The State has installed and is operating a toll-free telephone
hot line to respond to inquires from small businesses. Services provided by the SBAP are to be publicized through an
electronic bulletin board, association newsletters, industry groups, trade associations, and community roundtables.
The flow of information includes two types of components: A proactive component and a reactive component. The proactive
component involves adequate communication with and information outreach to small businesses in the form of easily
discernable information which specifically details their obligations under the CAA. The reactive component involves
the establishment of a clearinghouse for handling incoming inquiries from small businesses regarding methods for
achieving compliance with air pollution control requirements under the CAA. A more detailed description of the SBAP
elements follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Information dissemination methods available to qualified small businesses are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) An electronic bulletin board will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to provide guidance on applicable
rules and regulations, a calendar of events, a listing of public hearings and workshops, and a menu of directories
that include Federal, State, and private environmental hot lines and technology centers. The electronic bulletin
board will also provide a mechanism that allows users to evaluate the system and provide anonymous comments on the
program and information provided; the user can make suggestions. Application forms, instructions, brochures,
and other technical and compliance information can be requested through the electronic bulletin board. Up-to-date
State and Federal regulations for all media will be available with search capability for review and selection by qualified
small businesses. The electronic bulletin board is available via computer modem (phone line) directly on the small
business site or at a variety of locations within the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The SBAP will mail, upon request, information outlining the rights of small businesses and how those rights can
be exercised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Personal visits to small businesses may be made by the SBAP personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Public service announcements by mass media methods such as newspapers, radio, and television are available.
Videos are also available upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Area seminars will be conducted by the TACB on a periodic basis, including seminars at the central Austin, Texas
office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) A toll-free hot line to receive technical and compliance information will be implemented through the SBAP office.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) A clearinghouse will be established that will handle incoming inquiries from small businesses. Access to the
electronic bulletin board, facsimile machine, printer, and other information tools will be available to staff to
respond to the inquiries. Walk-in service will be provided, as well as electronic, written, and telephone contacts.
All information developed by the SBAP will be available through the clearinghouse, as well as any appropriate reference
materials needed to comply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with
pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning
alternative technologies, process changes, products, and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has met this requirement. The SBAP will assist small business stationary sources on methods of pollution
prevention and accidental release prevention and detection, including information concerning different technologies,
process changes, products, and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. Technical personnel from the
TACB will be available to provide pertinent information from the regional offices or from the Austin office. Circumstances
and specific emissions will dictate the required procedure to be followed by the small business stationary sources.
Mechanisms to provide assistance will include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The SBAP will coordinate information relating to pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and
detection with all Federal, State, and local agencies with environmental jurisdictions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The SBAP clearinghouse and electronic bulletin board will include information on pollution prevention, accidental
release prevention, and detection; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A directory of contacts will be developed and made available of technical experts in the areas of pollution prevention,
accidental release prevention, detection, and familiarity with pollution prevention technologies and alternatives
to reduce pollution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
Act in a timely and efficient manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has met this requirement. The State has committed to establish a small business stationary source compliance
assistance program for determining applicable requirements and permit issuance, including the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Industry-specific information packets will be developed and made available to small businesses and staff that
include information on rules, regulations, permit requirements, testing, recordkeeping, and compliance information,
as well as self-audit procedures and pollution prevention methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Inspectors will be provided training on how to educate small business owners on conducting self-inspections
and understanding the compliance requirements they must meet; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Whenever a new policy or rule is promulgated, workshops will be conducted to inform and educate the specific
small business community on appropriate compliance methods and procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
e. The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive
notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to
evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under
the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has met this requirement. The State has committed to provide methods for notifying small business stationary
sources on a timely basis of their rights under the CAA, including the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The SBAP will develop a data base that includes all small business stationary sources and associations, and will
coordinate with appropriate agency staff to notify affected sources of potential changes or rules that affect them;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Formal public notification procedures will be developed and implemented agencywide that ensure timely notice
of small businesses of their rights and obligations under the CAA; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The SBAP will work with trade associations, local agencies, educational facilities, and community leaders
to establish environmental partnerships to bring about voluntary compliance with regulations under the CAA through
participation and educational activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their
obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option
of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has met this requirement. Methods that are identified in paragraph II.B.1.b.(ii) above (concerning the
first requirement) shall be utilized by the State to inform small business stationary sources of their obligations
under the CAA, including a program for referring sources to qualified auditors or for the State to provide for audits
of the operations of such sources to determine if they are within the rules of the CAA. The audit program will be established
no later than November 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary
source for modification of (A) any work practice or technological method of compliance, or (B) the schedule of milestones
for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the
technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has met this requirement. The State will:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Provide a system for collecting and coordinating information on compliance methods and technologies. Data bases
and experts in different areas will provide definitive guidance information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Develop procedures to respond to requests from small business stationary sources for modification of any work
practice or technical methods of compliance, schedule of milestones for implementing such work practice, or method
of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological and financial capability of
any such small business stationary source. No such modification may be granted unless it is in compliance with the
applicable requirements of the CAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Establish approved procedures to provide review of requests from small businesses for modification of work
practice or technical methods of compliance based on financial and technological capability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SBAP core portion of the PROGRAM will be staffed with 18 positions. Hiring of all staff positions to support the
Texas SBAP will be completed by mid-1994. Most of the assistance provided to small businesses will be managed by this
group of staff members with assistance and input from the Small Business Advocate's (Ombudsman's) Office. Subsection
I.A.3.c) of the SIP, entitled ``Establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP)'', describes the details
of the SBAP, which meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a), and stated above. Furthermore, &sect;382.0365
of the TCAA requires the establishment of the SBAP and requires the TNRCC to implement this core portion of the PROGRAM
in accordance with the CAA and the EPA requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Ombudsman
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second PROGRAM element is the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of
small businesses in the regulatory process. Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a State office to serve
as the Ombudsman for small business stationary sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has met this requirement by hiring the Ombudsman on February 17, 1992. The Ombudsman reports directly to
the TNRCC Commissioners (previously to the TACB) and is not within the chain of command of the State agency itself.
Thus, the Ombudsman is separate from the air quality regulatory branch of the State agency, and therefore can be an
independent advocate for small businesses. The office is located at the central offices of the TNRCC, Office of Air
Quality (previously the TACB) at 12124 Park 35 Circle, Austin, Texas 78753. The office is currently partially staffed
and operational, and has been since October 1992. The Small Business Advocate's (Ombudsman's) Office will ultimately
be staffed with 11 positions by mid-1994, and the Office is responsible for administering the Ombudsman element of
this PROGRAM. The TCAA, &sect;382.0365(b)(3) provides the legal authority for establishment of the Small Business
Ombudsman. The Ombudsman has the authority to request information from other State agencies that assist small businesses
and has the ability to testify before the Legislature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. It shall be the responsibility of the State office to represent small business stationary sources that require
assistance in air pollution matters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The Ombudsman's Office has an adequate staff that includes appropriate personnel to assist in all phases of air
pollution control. Specific staffing plans are presented in Appendix C of the SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The Ombudsman's Office has been and will be provided adequate funding to maintain the office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The Ombudsman's Office is charged with the following duties:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Conducting independent evaluations of all aspects of the SBAP;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Reviewing and providing comments and recommendations to the EPA, the State, and the local air pollution control
authorities regarding the development and implementation of regulations that impact small businesses;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Facilitating and promoting the participation of small businesses in the development of new regulations that
impact small businesses;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Assisting in providing to higher authorities and the public information regarding the applicability of the
requirements of the CAA to small businesses;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Aiding in the dissemination of information (i.e., upcoming regulations, control technologies, etc.) to small
businesses and other interested parties;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Participating in and sponsoring meetings and conferences with State/local air pollution control authorities,
industry groups, and small business representatives;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Periodically reviewing the work and services provided by the SBAP with trade associations and small business
representatives;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(viii) Operating a telephone hot line to provide help on individual source problems and grievances;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Referring small businesses to the appropriate specialists in the SBAP where they may obtain information and
assistance on affordable alternative technologies, process changes, products, and operational methods to help
reduce air pollution and accidental releases;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Arranging for and assisting in the preparation of guideline documents by the SBAP to ensure that the language is
readily understandable by the layperson;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Working with trade associations and small businesses to bring about voluntary compliance with regulations
under the CAA;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) Interfacing with regional and State offices of the Small Business Administration, the Department of Commerce,
and/or other State and Federal agencies that may have programs to financially assist small businesses in need of funds
to comply with environmental regulations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xiii) Interfacing with private sector financial institutions to assist small businesses in locating sources of
funds to comply with State/local air pollution control requirements; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xiv) Conducting studies to evaluate the impacts of the CAA on the State's economy, local economies, and small businesses.
Copies of studies will be available upon request to the Ombudsman's Office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, it shall be the responsibility of the Small Business Advocate's Office to monitor the PROGRAM. The Office shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Since February 1992, serve as ombudsman for small businesses in accordance with the Federal mandate of section
507 of the 1990 CAA; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Work with the SBAP to develop programs and provide assistance to small businesses in all areas, as necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sufficient resources will be provided to the State Advocate's Office to enable it to discharge its responsibilities
effectively. Provisions have been made to provide the Ombudsman with direct access to the government agencies and
officials necessary to ensure that the concerns of small businesses will be heard. Further, the Ombudsman is vested
with sufficient authority to identify and propose solutions to small business problems as they relate to the implementation
of the CAA. The narrative SIP revision, subsection I.A.3.a) entitled ``Designation of a State Office to Serve as Ombudsman
for Small Businesses'', describes the details of the Ombudsman element of the PROGRAM. Section 382.0365 of the TCAA
requires the establishment of the Ombudsman and requires the TNRCC to implement this element in accordance with the
CAA and the EPA requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third PROGRAM element is the creation of a CAP to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.
Section 507(e) requires the State to establish a CAP that must include two members selected by the Governor who are
not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State legislature who are
owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the
Air Pollution Permit Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has met this requirement by committing to appoint members to the Panel by November 1994. Section 382.0365
of the TCAA creates the State Compliance Advisory Panel with responsibilities consistent with the requirements
in title V of the Federal CAA and specifies the panel's make-up, qualifications, and duties. Adequate support sources
and sufficient resources to conduct business will be provided to the Panel by the Ombudsman. The TNRCC, Office of Air
Quality (formerly the TACB), will assist in the formation of the seven-member CAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although section 507 of the CAA requires selection by the majority and minority leadership of the House and Senate,
the EPA believes that, given the makeup of the State's legislature, as required by the State's constitution, Texas'
selection complies with section 507 of the CAA. Texas has a bicameral legislature. There are constitutional provisions
providing for leadership of the Senate and House in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor (President of the Senate)
and in the Office of the Speaker of the House. However, there are no positions in the Texas legislature which equate
to majority and minority leaders, as in the national Congress. In accordance with section 507(e) of the Federal CAA,
&sect;382.0365(c) of the Texas Health and Safety Code provides for the composition of the CAP. Pursuant to &sect;382.0365(c),
both the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of the House, who are the equivalent Texas entities for purposes of legislative
selection of CAP members, shall each select two members. It is the EPA's position that this appointment mechanism
complies with the legislative intent of section 507(e). Appendix D of the SIP revision submittal discusses the State's
constitutional/statutory legislative process for all appointment procedures. Minority leadership is represented
in the appointments made by the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of the House, since the Lieutenant Governor is
elected State-wide, and the Speaker is elected by the entire House. The EPA believes that the process for designation
of CAP members by the two legislative leaders meets the intent of section 507(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP, the CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered, and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To periodically report to the EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction
Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(e)(1)(B) of the CAA requires the CAP to report on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
compliance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However, since State agencies are not required to comply with them,
EPA believes that the State PROGRAM must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general
principles of these Federal statutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) To review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has met these requirements (A) by enacting the State law creating the CAP and providing it with the enumerated
responsibilities, and (B) by committing to appoint members to the Panel by November 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Eligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Is not a major stationary source;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Texas has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance
under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the
CAA. This mechanism is described in the State's narrative SIP revision, subsection I.A.4. entitled ``Source Eligibility''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Texas has provided for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the
provisions of sections 507(c)(1) (C), (D), and (E) of the CAA but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State has also provided for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation
with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for
public hearing, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical
and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the CAA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this action, the EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Texas for establishing a Small Business
Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Texas has submitted a SIP revision for establishing each of the required PROGRAM elements required by
section 507 of the CAA. The EPA has reviewed this revision to the Texas SIP and is approving it as submitted because the
State's PROGRAM meets the requirements of section 507 of the CAA. The SIP includes a schedule of implementation, which
commits the State to have all three principal PROGRAM elements fully implemented by November 15, 1994. SIP schedule
implementation milestones are being tracked and monitored by the Region as part of the State's normal PROGRAM review.
Currently, Texas has partially staffed and initiated the SBAP, designated and partially staffed the State Office
to serve as Small Business Ombudsman, and created a CAP (and appointed five of its seven members). The CAP's initial
meeting will be held by November 15, 1994. The State is implementing a model program with most elements in place well
ahead of the EPA deadline of November 15, 1994 to have a fully operational program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, EPA has published a simultaneous proposed rule in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This direct final action will be effective October 18, 1994, unless adverse or critical comments are received by
September 19, 1994. If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn, and all public comments received
will be addressed in a subsequent final rule that is based on the proposed rule (please see the brief proposed rule published
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action
should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective
October 18, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms
with those requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this action, the EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved in this action does not impose any
new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage
of assistance provided by the State. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new
regulatory requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any
small entities affected.

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory
action from Executive Order 12866 review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 18, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. [See section
307(b)(2).]

X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) reasonably available control technology (RACT) issued on February 1, 1994. Approval of this committal allowed
the State to delay submitting NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT rules until February 1, 1995. On May 6, 1994, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit)
rejected EPA's construction of the conditional approval provision to allow for committal SIPs. In light of this decision
EPA issued notices of failure to submit NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT SIPs to all States that had merely submitted committal NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT SIPs. Therefore, both to comply with the Court's decision and in the interest of equity with other States, EPA
believes it is necessary to make this withdrawal effective upon publication so that EPA may then immediately issue
a finding of failure to submit to the State of Wisconsin.

On February 1, 1994, EPA issued a final conditional approval of a committal SIP submitted by the State of Wisconsin.
By this committal SIP, the State committed to adopt for the Milwaukee, Kewaunee, Manitowoc, and Sheboygan nonattainment
areas reasonably available control technology (RACT) for stationary sources of oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) emissions. The committal SIP consisted of a commitment of the State to adopt such rules and a schedule for adoption.
The State submitted this committal SIP pursuant to an interpretation of the EPA that such commitments could be considered
for conditional approval under section 110(k)(4) of the Act.

, No. 92&hyph;1630 (D.C. Cir.). NRDC sought to consolidate these cases, along with a third case challenging EPA's
committal SIP policy for inspection and maintenance (I/M) SIP submittals. The Court denied NRDC's motions to consolidate
the cases, but set all three cases for oral argument on the same date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three cases were argued before the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on March 3, 1994. On March 8, 1994, the Court
issued an Order with respect to the I/M challenge, finding that EPA's committal SIP policy ``is contrary to law.''
The Court issued an Amended Order on April 22, 1994, but did not change this fundamental decision in the Amended Order.
On May 6, 1994 the Court issued its full opinion as to all three cases. In that opinion, the Court reiterated its rejection
of EPA's construction of the conditional approval provision to allow for committal SIPs.

II. Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Court has clearly rejected EPA's use of the committal SIPs policy to extend statutory deadlines, EPA is
withdrawing its conditional approval of Wisconsin's NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT committal SIP. Furthermore, EPA is using the good cause exception of the Administrative Procedure Act to take
such action without providing an opportunity for notice and comment because the Court has clearly articulated that
such a conditional approval is contrary to law. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Notice and opportunity for comment are unnecessary
because the Court directly addressed the use of conditional approval for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT committal SIPs in its opinion and explicitly rejected such a use. Therefore, any comments would not be sufficient
to rebut this legal interpretation of the Court, and EPA would be obligated to take final action withdrawing the conditional
approval. Furthermore, because the Court has so clearly articulated that such action was contrary to law, it is not
in the public interest to prolong the process by providing notice and an opportunity for comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA also believes that it is proper to invoke the good cause exception for making an action effective earlier
than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). Prompted by the Court's order, by July 8, 1994, EPA issued notices of failure to submit NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT SIPs to all States that had merely submitted committal NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT SIPs. Because EPA conditionally approved of Wisconsin's NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT committal SIP and such conditional approval was still effective on July 8, 1994, EPA did not issue such a finding
to the State of Wisconsin. The State of Wisconsin, however, should not be put in a more favorable position than other
States merely because EPA had not yet taken final action on the other States' committal SIPs. Therefore, both to comply
with the Court's decision and in the interest of equity, EPA believes it is necessary to make this withdrawal effective
upon publication so that EPA may then immediately issue a finding of failure to submit to the State of Wisconsin.

C. Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approval does not create any new requirements. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant
impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act,
preparation of the regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness
of the State action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 13, 1989, the State of New Hampshire submitted a formal revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP). The
SIP revision consists of changes to New Hampshire's Air Quality Rules. New Hampshire also requests redesignation
of two municipalities from nonattainment for total suspended particulate (TSP) to unclassifiable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634) EPA promulgated revised National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate
matter which was based upon the measurement of particles having a mean aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less (PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The revised standards replace TSP with PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as the standard for ambient air quality. States were required to make revisions to their SIPs to reflect this change.
EPA classified certain areas of the United States as Group I or Group II for PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (52 FR 29383). Areas not so classified are Group III areas. The State of New Hampshire is a Group III area. In the case
of a Group III area, EPA expects the State's current air pollution control requirements are sufficient to attain and
maintain the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards. In such cases, the State need only submit revisions to its current SIP which adopt the new PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard and make other minor adjustments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
New Hampshire Submittal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 13, 1989, New Hampshire submitted formal SIP revisions. These SIP revisions change two sections of New Hampshire's
air quality rules. Env-A 303 of the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules refers to ambient air quality standards.
New Hampshire's submittal adopts the NAAQS for PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as the criteria pollutant for particulate matter for primary and secondary air quality standards and deletes the
now obsolete TSP NAAQS. New Hampshire also revised Env-A 1001, Open-Air Burning, to remove a reference to TSP. New
Hampshire's submittal also requests that the cities of Berlin and Manchester be redesignated from nonattainment
to unclassifiable for TSP. This change is consistent with and encouraged by the final rulemaking of July 1, 1987 (52
FR 24682), because it eliminates the need for TSP to be monitored in addition to PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Both areas are expected to meet applicable PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of New Hampshire held a public hearing on the proposed changes on March 16, 1989. There were no public comments.
On April 21, 1989, the amendments to rule Env-A 303, were approved by the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative
Rules at a public hearing, and received final adoption by the Air Resources Division, Department of Environmental
Services. On May 24, 1989, the amendment to rule Env-A 1001 received the same approval. New Hampshire's submittal
clearly defines PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and sets primary and secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM

10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 defined in accordance with appendix K of 40 CFR part 50.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Legal authority to enforce these rules is contained in New Hampshire Law RSA 125&hyph;C:4. The State does not plan
to delegate authority to any local agencies.

Changes in New Hampshire's Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New Hampshire's SIP revisions amend two rules: Env-A 303 and Env-A 1001. Env-A 303, specifically section Env-A 303.01,
defines primary and secondary ambient air standards. New Hampshire's revisions define primary and secondary standards
for particulate matter, consisting of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, measured at an annual arithmetic mean of 50 &mu;g/m3, and a maximum average 24 hour concentration of 150 &mu;g/m3,
which may be exceeded on a number of days equal or less than an average of one per year as determined in accordance with
Appendix K of 40 CFR Part 50. Env-A 1001 specifies when open-air burning will be permitted or prohibited. The only change
proposed would replace the phrase ``Total Suspended Particles (TSP)'', with the word ``particulates''. The revised
rule forbids open burning in areas designated nonattainment for particulates.

Redesignation of TSP Nonattainment Areas
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's final rulemaking of July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24682) promulgating the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard encourages states to request the redesignation of TSP nonattainment areas as unclassifiable for TSP at
the time they submit their PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP revisions. This is permissible because TSP is no longer the indicator for the particulate matter NAAQS. An area
designation (i.e., unclassifiable) must be maintained until the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 increment takes effect because section 163 PSD increments depend on the existence of section 107 designations. New
Hampshire has requested the redesignation of Berlin and Manchester from nonattainment to unclassifiable for TSP.
The entire State of New Hampshire was originally classified as Group III (52 FR 29383); therefore it is permissible
to redesignate these areas as unclassifiable for TSP.

If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by simultaneously publishing
two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing
a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised
that this action will be effective on October 18, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The US EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved State implementation plan for conformance
with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. Although New Hampshire submitted this request
prior to November 15, 1990, the Agency has determined that this action conforms with those requirements. The revisions
strengthen the requirements in the New Hampshire SIP and conform to all of EPA's current regulations.

States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 18, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule amends 40 CFR part 749, subpart D, which prohibits, under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA),
the use of hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals in comfort cooling towers and the distribution of
such chemicals in commerce for use in comfort cooling towers. Today's action amends 40 CFR 749.68 to clarify that only
hexavalent chromium chemicals that can be used for water treatment are the subjects of this regulation, not other
hexavalent chromium chemicals. This amendment limits the scope of export notifications currently required for
hexavalent chromium chemicals under TSCA section 12(b), the TSCA Export Notification Rule (40 CFR part 707), and
&sect;749.68. No changes to the prohibitions or labeling requirements of the hexavalent chromium rule are intended
by this amendment. As amended, &sect;749.68 does not trigger the section 12(b) export notification requirements
for exports of hexavalent chromium products such as certain paints, dyes, pigments, coatings, electroplating and
conversion coating products, and other products containing hexavalent chromium that cannot be used to treat water.

 In the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63148), EPA proposed an amendment to 40 CFR part 749, subpart D, which prohibits the use of
hexavalent chromium (Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
)-based water treatment chemicals in comfort cooling towers (CCTs) and the distribution of such chemicals in commerce
for use in CCTs. The regulatory text of today's amendment is identical to the regulatory text of the proposed amendment.
Comments received on the proposed amendment are addressed in Unit V of this preamble. Today's amendment modifies
40 CFR 749.68 to clarify that only Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals that can be used for water treatment are the subjects of the regulation, not other Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals. This change limits the scope of TSCA section 12(b) export notifications currently required for Cr

I. Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment is being promulgated pursuant to TSCA sections 6 (15 U.S.C. 2605) and 12(b) (15 U.S.C. 2611(b)). Section
6 of TSCA authorizes EPA to impose regulatory controls if EPA finds that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture presents
or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. Under this authority, EPA issued
a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 3, 1990 (55 FR 222), that prohibits the use of Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-based water treatment chemicals in CCTs and the distribution in commerce of Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-based water treatment chemicals for use in CCTs (40 part CFR 749, subpart D). The rule also requires persons who distribute
in commerce Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-based water treatment chemicals to label the containers of the chemicals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 12(b) of TSCA requires that any person who exports or intends to export to a foreign country a chemical substance
or mixture for which: (1) The submission of data is required under TSCA section 4 (15 U.S.C. 2603) or 5(b) (15 U.S.C.
2604(b)); (2) an order has been issued under section 5; (3) a rule has been proposed or promulgated under section 5 or
6 (15 U.S.C. 2605); or (4) relief has been granted under section 5 or 7 (15 U.S.C. 2606) to notify the Administrator of
EPA of such exportation or intent to export. Upon receipt of such notification, section 12(b) of TSCA requires EPA
to furnish the government of the importing country with: notice of the availability of data received pursuant to action
under section 4 or 5(b), or notice of such rule, order, action, or relief under section 5, 6, or 7. EPA promulgated a rule
setting forth the export notification requirements of TSCA section 12(b) under 40 CFR part 707, subpart D. EPA amended
the export notification rule to limit notifications triggered by TSCA section 4 actions on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40238).

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule was promulgated under TSCA section 6, export notification requirements under section 12(b) are triggered.
Currently, all Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals are subject to section 12(b) because the term ``Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals'' is presently defined in &sect;749.68(d)(10) as ``any combination of chemical substances containing
hexavalent chromium and includes hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals.'' Thus, for example, the
export of paint containing a Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemical that cannot be used for water treatment would currently trigger the section 12(b) notification requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the final Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule, EPA stated that pursuant to TSCA section 12(b) and 40 CFR part 707, subpart D, persons who export or intend to export
Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals are required to notify EPA of those activities. EPA indicated that export notification would be required
for all Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exports ``because the substance subject to the rule is Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' and that it did not believe that the requirement should be narrowed, as a practical matter, because of the difficulty
in determining the end use of the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at the time of export. EPA also anticipated that the burden of the notification requirements that would be triggered
by the export of Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for uses not regulated by the rule would be minimal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After promulgation of the final Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule, the Chrome Coalition filed a Petition for Review with the United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia
Circuit dated April 17, 1990 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chrome Coalition v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, No. 90&hyph;1138). In the petition, the Chrome Coalition argued that because EPA failed to set forth its interpretation
of TSCA section 12(b) in the proposed rule, the public was unable to comment on that interpretation. Additionally,
they argued that EPA's interpretation of section 12(b) is too broad in the context of the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule, and imposes an unnecessary burden on any business that exports products containing Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, even when the products cannot be used in water treatment. As a part of the settlement reached with the Chrome Coalition
on December 15, 1992, EPA agreed to promulgate a rule that addressed the concerns raised by the Coalition. The Settlement
Agreement was filed with the United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit on January 7, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the Chrome Coalition's Petition, EPA reevaluated the need to broadly require export notification for
all Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals and proposed to modify the rule to clarify it on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63148).

III. Summary of this Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is amending the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule solely to clarify the scope of coverage of the rule, thereby limiting the scope of the required section 12(b) notifications.
This rule will require notification under 40 CFR part 707, subpart D, for the export or intended export of Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals that can be used for water treatment. EPA is listing in &sect;749.68 certain specific Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals that the Agency believes can be used to treat water. This is not meant to be a complete listing of all Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals that can be used to treat water, but rather a listing of examples. The export of any Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals alone, or in combination with other chemical substances when the mixture can be used to treat water cooling
systems, will trigger the TSCA section 12(b) export notification requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under existing language of the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule, TSCA section 12(b) export notification is required for all Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 compounds, if they are exported alone, or in combination with other substances, even if the exported product cannot
be used to treat water. With today's amendment, exporters of hexavalent chromium products such as paints, dyes, pigments,
electroplating and conversion coating products, and other substances containing Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that cannot be used to treat water will not need to report the export to EPA under TSCA section 12(b). To accomplish this,
EPA is amending the subject of the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule, certain definitions, and other appropriate provisions, as discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Discussion of this Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Exports of certain Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals (e.g., in such products as paints, dyes, pigments, electroplating and conversion coating products) may
now be triggering TSCA section 12(b) export notifications in more cases than are necessary to reasonably carry out
the purposes of TSCA section 12(b) and the section 6 Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule. EPA believes the current burden associated with exporters providing notification for exports of Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals that cannot be used for water treatment to be substantial, without providing any appreciable reduction
in the risk addressed in the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule. In addition, the benefits to countries receiving these notifications are thought to be minimal. This amendment
modifies &sect;749.68 to clarify that only Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals that can be used to treat water are the subjects of the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule. Because the amended regulation will address the risk concerns identified as the basis for the existing Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule, but at a lower cost, EPA finds that the amended rule will continue to protect human health and the environment
against unreasonable risk of injury. Moreover, this change, EPA believes, will provide to importing countries information
more reflective of EPA's concerns and will further Congress' intent, pursuant to TSCA section 2(c) (15 U.S.C. 2601
(c)) that EPA administer TSCA ``in a reasonable and prudent manner.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change is supported by the TSCA section 6 Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rulemaking effort. The supporting documentation used by EPA to promulgate the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule focused on data regarding Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from CCTs (55 FR 222 at 224). A background document, ``Chromium Emissions from Comfort Cooling Towers -
Background Information for Proposed Standards'' (EPA-450/3-87-010a), March 1, 1988 (OPTS 61012) described EPA's
regulatory alternatives and expected impacts. The information-gathering, analysis, and rulemaking were used
solely to support a TSCA section 6 determination regarding Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-based water treatment chemicals and not all possible Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mixtures and products. Therefore, EPA believes that this amendment is consistent with the originally intended scope
and coverage of the TSCA section 6 regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised regulatory language clarifies that the chemicals subject to the rule are any Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals that can be used to treat water, either alone or in combination with other chemicals, where the mixture can
be used to treat water. As stated above, the intended effect of this change is to reduce the scope of the TSCA section
12(b) export notifications that are triggered by &sect;749.68. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the section heading of &sect;749.68 reads ``Hexavalent chromium chemicals in comfort cooling towers.''
EPA believes that a more appropriate focus and heading for the rule is ``Hexavalent chromium-based water treatment
chemicals in cooling systems,'' and is therefore implementing this change. Also, because the term ``hexavalent
chromium chemicals'' in the current &sect;749.68(d)(10) will no longer be used, the definition is dropped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the TSCA section 12(b) export notification requirements are triggered by the export of certain
chemical substances or mixtures that are the subjects of certain actions under TSCA, including Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because of the section 6 Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule. Currently, &sect;749.68(a) states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Chemical substance subject to this section
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Hexavalent chromium, usually in the form of sodium dichromate (CAS No. 10588&hyph;01&hyph;9), is subject to this
section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today, &sect;749.68(a) is amended to state:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Chemicals subject to this section
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals that contain hexavalent chromium, usually in the form of
sodium dichromate (CAS No. 10588&hyph;01&hyph;9), are subject to this section. Other examples of hexavalent chromium
compounds that can be used to treat water are: Chromic acid (CAS No. 7738&hyph;94&hyph;5), chromium trioxide (CAS
No. 1333&hyph;83&hyph;0), dichromic acid (CAS No. 13530&hyph;68&hyph;2), potassium chromate (CAS No. 7789&hyph;00&hyph;6),
potassium dichromate (CAS No. 7778&hyph;50&hyph;9), sodium chromate (CAS No. 7775&hyph;11&hyph;3), zinc chromate
(CAS No. 13530&hyph;65&hyph;9), zinc chromate hydroxide (CAS No. 153936&hyph;94&hyph;6), zinc dichromate (CAS
No. 14018&hyph;95&hyph;2), and zinc potassium chromate (CAS No. 11103&hyph;86&hyph;9).

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By instituting this amendment in conjunction with the other changes discussed herein, especially those at &sect;749.68(d)(11)
(see below), EPA intends that only Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 compounds which can be used to treat water, either alone or in combination with other chemicals, where the mixture
can be used to treat water, would be subject to the rule and thus the section 12(b) export notification requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Related to this change, EPA is amending certain language in &sect;749.68(b), entitled ``Purpose,'' and &sect;749.68(c),
entitled ``Applicability,'' to reflect the changed focus of the rule from Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-based water treatment chemicals. Refer to &sect;749.68(b) and (c) of the regulatory text for the revised language.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also adding a chemical definition of Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in &sect;749.68(d)(10) to clarify the revised subject of the rule. The definition of Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is now ``the oxidation state of chromium with an oxidation number of +6; a coordination number of 4 and tetrahedral
geometry.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another key change is a revised definition of ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals.'' The current
definition in &sect;749.68(d)(11) states that ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals means any
hexavalent chromium, alone or in combination with other water treatment chemicals, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
used
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to treat water.'' (emphasis added). The amended definition states that ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment
chemicals means any chemical containing hexavalent chromium which can be used to treat water, either alone or in combination
with other chemicals, where the mixture can be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
used
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to treat water.'' (emphasis added). This change is intended to require export notification for the export of chemicals
that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
can be used
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to treat water, whether or not they are actually used to treat water. EPA believes that exporters will not always know
the actual end use of the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 product. However, EPA believes that exporters are likely to know potential end uses or how Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can be used. Additionally, to help exporters identify which Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 compounds can be used, either alone, or in combination with other chemicals to treat water, the Agency is listing examples
of such compounds. This change is not intended to have any effect on the current labeling requirements or the prohibitions
of the Cr

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order that the labeling requirements will not be affected by the changes being made today, EPA is changing the language
of &sect;749.68(g). Currently, the labeling requirement at &sect;749.68(g) states: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Labeling
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Each person who distributes in commerce hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals after February
20, 1990, shall affix a label. . .
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the current definition of ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals'' in &sect;749.68(d)(11)
is ``any hexavalent chromium, alone or in combination with other water treatment chemicals, used to treat water,''
(emphasis added) labeling is required only for hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals used to treat
water. As stated above, the new definition of ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals'' in &sect;749.68(d)(11)
is ``any hexavalent chromium which can be used to treat water. . .'' (emphasis added). Without changing &sect;749.68(g),
this new definition would have the effect of expanding the labeling requirements to require labeling of any hexavalent
chromium, either alone or in combination with other chemicals, that can be used to treat water, where the mixture can
be used to treat water. However, as the intent of this amendment is not to change the scope of the labeling requirements,
the phrase ``for use in cooling systems'' is being added to &sect;749.68(g). This section now reads:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Labeling
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Each person who distributes in commerce hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals for use in cooling

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes this change, along with the other modifications, will have the effect of maintaining the current labeling
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of the changes are meant to reduce the scope of TSCA section 12(b) export notifications without affecting the prohibitions
and labeling requirements in the current rule. With today's amendment, EPA intends that exporters of paints, dyes,
pigments, electroplating and conversion coating products, and other products containing Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that cannot be used to treat water will not report the export to EPA under TSCA section 12(b). To accomplish this, EPA
is amending certain definitions and other appropriate provisions of the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule as discussed above. EPA believes that today's rule will reduce the burden on the regulated community in cases
where export notification provides little or no benefit to importing countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule is consistent with other Agency efforts to improve the utility of these notices for receiving governments,
and to optimize the ability of EPA to process more efficiently export notices it receives annually and respond to requests
from foreign governments for additional information on chemicals and export notices. For example, on July 21, 1981
(46 FR 37608), in its notice on ``Asbestos Export Notification,'' EPA clarified the reporting responsibilities
of persons exporting asbestos or mixtures containing asbestos by defining which types of asbestos require export
notification. As another example, on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40238), in a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document entitled ``Export Notification Requirement; Change to Reporting Requirements; Final Rule,'' EPA issued
a rule that changed the current annual notification requirements for exporters of chemical substances and mixtures
subject to TSCA section 4 test rules or consent orders to a one-time (instead of annual) export notification per chemical
per importing country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that such actions, and today's action, will enhance other governments' ability to thoughtfully consider
notices received under TSCA section 12(b) and react appropriately to chemicals being imported by focusing export
notifications on a more defined set of chemicals that EPA has identified for regulatory action. As EPA stated in the
preamble to the final export notification rule, ``[t]he intended focus of the notice to foreign governments is the
chemical substance or mixture and what EPA has done or found out about it. . . .'' (45 FR 82844, December 16, 1980). Since
the primary purpose of TSCA section 12(b) export notification is to alert and inform other governments of hazards
that may be associated with a chemical substance or mixture, it is important that the export notification requirements
are implemented in a manner that efficiently conveys EPA's concerns. EPA believes that today's amendment will increase
the efficiency of the operation of the section 12(b) requirement as applied to the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule by eliminating the current export notifications associated with the export of Cr

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals that cannot be used to treat water.

V. Significant Comments on the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requested that EPA expressly mention electroplating and conversion coating products among the examples
of products excluded from the TSCA section 12(b) notification requirement. Based on a technical evaluation of this
request, in appropriate sections of the preamble of this final rule, EPA is adding electroplating and conversion
coating products as examples of products excluded from the export notification requirement because these products
containing hexavalent chromium cannot be used to treat water. However, EPA does not intend that the listing of specific
examples should exclude any other products that cannot be used to treat water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second comment was that EPA revise the definition of ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals''
to encompass only hexavalent chromium ``intended'' for use in treating water, not that which ``can be'' so used. EPA
considered the option of substituting hexavalent chromium ``intended'' for use in treating water for the proposed
``can be used'' in the definition of ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals,'' but has decided against
such substitution. EPA believes it could be extremely difficult to determine the exporter's intent regarding use
of an exported product. It is difficult to determine the ``intent'' of a manufacturer in exporting a substance or mixture.
However, even if the intent of the exporter could be determined as not including water treatment uses, once the substance
or mixture is imported into the foreign country, it could be used for a water treatment purpose not withstanding the
intent of the exporter. Retaining the ``can be used'' definition helps to ensure that foreign countries receive notice
of the import of substances or mixtures that could be of concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment suggested adopting a de minimis and impurity exclusion for the export of section 12(b) substances.
EPA currently requires export notification for any section 12(b) substance present in mixtures, excluding articles
other than PCB articles, at any concentration and regardless of whether it is intentionally present in the mixture
or is present as an impurity. The suggestion made by the commenter is outside the scope of this rulemaking. However,
as stated in the preamble to a final amendment made to the export notification rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40238), EPA may examine additional approaches modifying the section 12(b) export notification
program in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter requested that EPA publish a formal 12(b) list in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which
would include effective and sunset (termination) dates. Because section 12(b) export notification is required
only for substances that are the subject of certain regulatory actions taken under TSCA section 4, 5, 6, or 7, EPA believes
the notice associated with publication of these underlying actions in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is sufficient for purposes of section 12(b). Moreover, the notices initiating these underlying actions generally
include a specific discussion of obligations triggered under 12(b). Section 12(b) of TSCA requires no additional
rulemaking, separate from the underlying actions, to trigger the export notification requirements. For final rules
and orders, effective dates for the 12(b) requirements are the same as the effective dates of the underlying actions.
In cases where the proposed actions prompt the section 12(b) export notifications, the requirement to submit export
notifications begins 30 days after publication of the proposal in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. See 40 CFR 707.65(b). Sunset dates (i.e., dates that certain requirements terminate) for purpose of TSCA section
12(b) apply only where the underlying requirement prompting the export notifications are TSCA section 4 or 5(b) actions.
As stated in the preamble to the TSCA section 12(b) Export Notification Rule amendments in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40238), these sunset dates coincide with the expiration of the test data reimbursement period
as defined at 40 CFR 790.3. In the near future, EPA plans to issue a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice listing test data reimbursement period expiration dates for certain TSCA section 4 substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As recognized by the commenter, EPA currently makes available an informal list of substances subject to section 12(b)
export notification that is updated on or about a quarterly basis. Although inadvertent omission from this section
12(b) list does not excuse non-compliance with the statutory requirements of section 12(b), EPA believes it does
serve as a valuable compliance aid. In light of the above, EPA believes that publication of the section 12(b) list in
the CFR is not warranted at the present time.

VI. Confidentiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A person may assert a claim of confidentiality for any information, submitted to EPA in connection with this rule.
Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information so claimed when it is submitted to EPA. Persons must mark
information claimed as confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL''
or some other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of confidentiality only
to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, Subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality
for information at the time it is submitted to EPA, EPA may make the information public without further notice to that
person.

 rule that would be associated with these amendments. The total savings to industry and EPA associated with this amendment
are estimated to be $5,400 to $16,300 per year. EPA's complete economic analysis is available in the public record
for this rule (OPPTS&hyph;61018).

IX. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it
has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this rule does not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small businesses. This rule actually decreases the reporting burden for small businesses
that export Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 chemicals that cannot be used for water treatment, which are currently subject to the reporting requirements of TSCA
section 12(b). This rule would not add any economic burden to small businesses. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on small
businesses.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rule at 40 CFR part 749, subpart D under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), and has
assigned OMB control number 2060&hyph;0193 to that collection activity. In addition, OMB has also approved the information
collection requirements contained in the Export Notification Rule at 40 CFR part 707, subpart D under the provisions
of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and has assigned OMB control number 2070&hyph;0030 to that activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in this rule are not expected to impact the information collection requirements contained in the Cr
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
+6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rule at 40 CFR part 749, subpart D, and EPA does not expect to change the burden estimates approved by OMB under OMB control
number 2060&hyph;0193. However, since the rule amends the applicability of the information collection requirements
contained in the Export Notification Rule at 40 CFR part 707, subpart D, EPA expects to change the burden estimates
approved under OMB control number 2070&hyph;0030, and upon the signature of this final rule, will submit an information
correction worksheet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule will reduce the number of export notices required from the public by approximately 237 submissions per year.
Public reporting burden for the collection of information under 40 CFR part 707, ``Chemical Imports and Exports,''
is estimated to average .5 to 1.5 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
Total public reporting burden is expected to decrease as a result of this rule by approximately 119 to 356 hours per
year.

SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) hereby amends the regulations that establish designated ports for the importation,
exportation, and reexportation of plants by adding the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ports at Gulfport,
MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are
listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), or listed under the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The USDA has adequate facilities
and personnel at these ports to qualify the ports as designated ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation
of plants under the terms of the Act and CITES. The addition of these ports to the list of designated ports will facilitate
trade and the enforcement of the Act and CITES.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), requires, among other things, that plants be imported, exported,
or reexported only at designated ports or, under certain limited circumstances, at nondesignated ports. Section
9(f) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1538[f]) provides for the designation of ports. Under section 9(f)(1), the Secretary of
the Interior (Secretary) has the authority to establish designated ports based on a finding that such an action would
facilitate enforcement of the Act and reduce the costs of that enforcement. The United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) and the Secretary are responsible for enforcing provisions of the Act and the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) relating to the importation, exportation, and reexportation
of plants listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in 50 CFR part 24, ``Importation and Exportation of Plants,'' are for the purpose of establishing
ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants. Plants that are listed as endangered or threatened
in 50 CFR 17.12 or in the appendices to CITES in 50 CFR 23.23 are required to be accompanied by documentation and may be
imported, exported, or reexported only at one of the USDA ports listed in section 24.12(a) of the regulations. Certain
other USDA ports are designated for the importation, exportation, or reexportation of specific listed plants. Section
24.12(e) of the regulations contains a list of USDA ports that are, for the purposes of the Act and CITES, designated
ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants that are not listed as endangered or threatened.
(The USDA regulations in 7 CFR 319.37 contain additional prohibitions and restrictions governing the importation
of plants through those ports.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (59 FR 13921), the Service proposed that the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, be
listed as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or threatened
under the Act or listed under CITES.

The Service's March 24, 1994, notice invited the submission of written comments regarding the proposal for a 60-day
comment period ending on May 23, 1994. One comment was received by that date, from a lumber company. The commenter fully
supported the proposed rule.

Section 9(f)(1) of the Act provides that any person may request an opportunity to comment at a public hearing before
the Secretary of the Interior confers designated port status on any port. Accordingly, the Service's March 24, 1994,
notice invited public hearing requests, which were required to be received by the Service on or before May 9, 1994.
No such requests were received.

Treasury Department Approval To Designate Proposed Ports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9(f)(1) of the Act also provides, in part, that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``For the purpose of facilitating enforcement of this chapter and reducing costs thereof, the Secretary of the Interior,
with approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and after notice and opportunity for public hearing, may, by regulation,
designate ports and change such designations.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval from the Secretary of the Treasury was obtained in accordance with these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, the Service is adopting the provisions of the proposal
as a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effect of this rule is to grant an exemption from 16 U.S.C. 1538(f), which generally prohibits importation of wildlife
and plants except at such ports as may be designated. Accordingly, it may be given immediate effect under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1),
which permits a rule that ``grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction'' to be given immediate effect.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service believes that establishing the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, as designated
ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under
CITES will have a positive economic impact. These ports are major ports of entry for logs and lumber, but they had not
been designated as ports for the importation of logs and lumber from listed trees (prior to the effective date of this
rule). Presently, importers wishing to import logs and lumber from listed trees into a U.S. port on the Gulf of Mexico
can use only Mobile, AL, New Orleans, LA, and Houston and Brownsville, TX. Importers wishing to import logs and lumber
from listed trees into a port in the northwestern United States have only the port of Seattle, WA. Adding Gulfport,
MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, to the list of designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees
listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES will result in a savings in time and transportation
costs for importers of logs and lumber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic effect
on a substantial number of small entities, as described in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has determined that this final rule adding designated ports under authority of the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 for the importation of plants is not a major Federal action which will significantly affect the quality
of the human environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Landings from the August 3&hyph;4 fishing period in Area 4C totaled 34,000 lb (15.42 metric tons (mt)). This brings
the season total to 715,000 lb (324.32 mt), slightly exceeding the 700,000 lb (317.51 mt) catch limit. Area 4C is now
closed to halibut fishing for the remainder of 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An emergency interim rule (59 FR 6222, February 10, 1994) and subsequent extension of effective date (59 FR 24965,
May 13, 1994) apportioned the Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limit for trawl gear into bycatch allowances
and seasonal apportionments thereof among fishery categories. In accordance with &sect;672.20(f)(3)(iii), the
shallow-water species fishery that is defined at &sect;672.20(f)(3)(ii)(A) was apportioned 200 metric tons of
Pacific halibut PSC for the third season, the period June 30, 1994, through September 30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with &sect;672.20(f)(3)(iv), that vessels participating
in the trawl shallow-water species fishery in the GOA have caught the third seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific
halibut PSC apportioned to that fishery. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for each species and species
group that comprise the shallow-water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, except directed fishing
for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those portions of the GOA open to directed fishing for pollock. The
species and species groups that comprise the shallow-water species fishery are: Pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water
flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel, and ``other species.'' This closure is effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., August
15, 1994, through 12 noon, A.l.t., September 30, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (the Act), amended the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to provide
a statutory mandate for drug testing of air carrier employees. The Act also prescribed certain consequences for prohibited
drug use and mandated the use of split specimen testing. This rule amends the antidrug rule for conformity to the requirements
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, this rule incorporates other changes to the antidrug rule. These changes clarify the requirements of
the rule and also address concerns that have been raised since the rule was published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this rule includes substantive changes to address provisions of the rule that are unclear, do not comport
with the changes in the final DOT drug testing procedures, or do not adequately address required steps in the implementation
process.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 14, 1988, the FAA issued an antidrug rule which required specified aviation employers and operators to
initiate antidrug programs for personnel performing safety-sensitive functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 28, 1991, the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (the Act) was enacted. Among other things,
the Act provided a statutory mandate for drug testing in the aviation industry and required specified consequences
for positive drug tests. A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), published on February 15, 1994, proposed amendments
to certain provisions of the FAA's antidrug rule in accordance with the Act. The NPRM also proposed certain other changes
to the antidrug rule that would clarify employer and Medical Review Officer responsibilities and addressed other
issues that have been identified since the promulgation of the rule. This rule incorporates the requirements of the
statutory mandate, as well as the clarifying amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven comments were received in the docket in response to the NPRM. These comments were taken into consideration during
the development of this final rule.

Reason for Expedited Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A section of this rule concerning split specimen testing is being made effective in less than the 30 days from publication
usually required by law. With an effective date of August 15, 1994, for this section the FAA can ensure that this rule
is consistent with the DOT final rule which was published on February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7354). The DOT rule implements
split specimen collection testing required by the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, as of August
15, 1994, for four modal administrations under the DOT. The DOT rule provided affected employers 6 months to begin
implementing split specimen testing. Because employers have been given prior notification of the requirement for
split specimen testing, employers subject to this rule will not be unduly burdened by an effective date of less than
30 days. The FAA has therefore determined that good cause exists under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 533(d)(3) to warrant
an expedited effective date.

Discussion of Comments and Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rulemaking action encompasses a variety of changes to the FAA's antidrug regulation, most of which affect the
operational provisions of the antidrug rule found in 14 CFR part 121, appendix I. Because a variety of changes, both
substantive and minor technical revisions, were made to appendix I, the entire revised appendix has been republished
in this final rule. Each of the significant changes and any related comments are discussed in detail below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Random Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This final rule does not change the random drug testing requirements. The FAA notes, however, that a separate NPRM
was jointly issued by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation and all DOT agencies with antidrug rules on February
15, 1994 (59 FR 7614). This NPRM proposed parallel changes to each agency's rule under which the random drug testing
rate would be established based on the rate of random positive drug tests in the particular industry. Because of the
common aspects of the random testing issues, the FAA will make any such changes as part of a joint final rule to be issued
in the near future.

Prohibition on Service; Rehabilitation and Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act section entitled ``Prohibition on service'' (found at new FAAct
section 614(b)) provides that no person who is determined to have engaged in illegal use of drugs may perform a safety-sensitive
function after such determination. In accordance with this section, the FAA proposed that sections of the FAA's regulations
that address the use of prohibited drugs (see, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 14 CFR 65.46(c), (d)) would be revised slightly to reflect the fact that entities other than certificate holders
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., contractor companies) can require drug tests under the antidrug rule if they have an FAA-approved antidrug program.
The changes were supported by commenters and are included in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 614(b)(2) of the FAAct, ``Effect of Rehabilitation,'' states that no covered employee may perform a safety-sensitive
function after engaging in prohibited conduct unless he or she has completed a rehabilitation program under the provisions
of section 614(c) of the FAAct. Section 614(c)(1) requires the Administrator to prescribe regulations that at a minimum
provide for the identification and opportunity for treatment of employees in need of assistance in resolving problems
with the use of controlled substances. Further, the section states that the Administrator shall determine the circumstances
under which such employees shall be required to participate in such a program. This language recognizes that rehabilitation
may not be appropriate or warranted in all cases of prohibited conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative requirement of section 614(b)(2) is implemented in the revisions to paragraph A, section VII, of
appendix I. The legislative history of the Act reflected the fact that the FAA did not prescribe regulations with respect
to specific types of rehabilitation in its antidrug rule. However, because the Act requires the FAA to prescribe regulations
under which persons in need of assistance would be identified, this final rule modifies the Medical Review Officer
(MRO) duties to include such identification. Some commenters noted that a MRO may not be qualified as a substance abuse
professional (SAP) and should therefore be required to refer the individual to a qualified SAP for the evaluation.
It was the FAA's intent that only MROs who also meet the qualifications of a SAP (as contained in the definition of a SAP)
would be authorized to perform the initial evaluation of individuals who have a verified positive drug test result
or refuse to submit to a required test. The final rule has been changed to clarify this requirement. It also incorporates
a provision parallel to one in the alcohol misuse prevention program final rule that limits the providers or facilities
to which SAPs who perform an initial evaluation may refer an employee determined to be in need of assistance. This limitation
also applies to MROs who serve as SAPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed, and this final rule provides, that each covered employee who had a verified positive drug test result
or who refused to submit to testing would be advised of all relevant resources available to the employee. Further,
each such employee would be evaluated by a SAP (who could be the MRO) who would determine whether and what assistance
the employee needed in resolving problems associated with prohibited drug use. Some commenters representing labor
organizations stated that the FAA should include requirements that employers must provide or pay for any required
treatment and that employees should be prohibited from terminating employees who are undergoing treatment. The
FAA reaffirms its position that these issues are most appropriately matters for employer/employee negotiation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New section 614(b)(3) of the FAAct, ``Performance of prior duties prohibited,'' provides sanctions for employees
who engage in prohibited use of drugs. It provides that, under certain circumstances discussed below, an individual
shall not be permitted to perform the duties related to air transportation that he or she performed prior to the date
he or she engaged in the prohibited drug use. The legislation does not require that the individual's employment be
terminated, nor that he or she be reassigned to perform non-safety-sensitive functions. However, it is an absolute
bar to the performance of the same duties the employee performed before the violation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule implements the provisions in the Act in two ways. Appendix I has been revised by adding paragraph F to
section VI to preclude any person from performing the safety-sensitive function that the individual was performing
if that person had two verified positive drug test results or if the individual used a prohibited drug while performing
such a safety-sensitive function. A definition of ``performing'' paralleling the one in the alcohol misuse prevention
program rule has been added. In order to effectively administer this provision, the final rule provides that this
prohibition is effective for drug tests and on-duty drug use occurring after the effective date of the final rule.
(The NPRM proposed to amend the regulatory sections to implement this prohibition. However, for clarity and consistency
with the alcohol misuse prevention program we are adding this provision to appendix I.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bar is limited to the narrow prohibition in the Act and will not affect the performance of other duties. While the
FAA recognizes that a narrow bar could lead to anomalous results (for example, a person might be barred from performing
screening duties but could serve as a pilot), a bar that is limited to the statutory requirements is more likely to be
consistent with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act or other legal constraints. The FAA expects
that employers will exercise responsible judgment in determining whether employees not expressly barred from service
should be permitted to perform other safety-sensitive duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bar on two-time violators will apply both to persons who have gone through rehabilitation and to those who, after
evaluation, were determined not to need treatment. Otherwise, an employee who was found to need treatment and had
an instance of recidivism would be subject to the bar, but an employee who did not need assistance but simply chose to
use drugs again would not be. This provision is established under the FAA's general statutory authority to prescribe
regulations affecting aviation safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing labor organizations objected to the permanent bar in principle, but recognized the FAA's
statutory requirement to impose such a bar. Commenters representing employers objected to the FAA's implementation
of the permanent bar in which the burden of ensuring that permanently barred individuals do not perform the relevant
safety-sensitive duties is placed on employers. These commenters assert that the FAA should maintain a name-specific
``black list'' that employers could check to determine an applicant's status. The FAA has not adopted this recommendation
and believes that it would be inappropriate to do so. Aside from the obvious privacy and logistical issues associated
with the creation of such a data base, it would not serve the purpose asserted by the commenters, which appears to be
to relieve the employers of the necessity of obtaining information regarding applicants' drug testing history.
However, the permanent bar is not the only measure precluding service in a safety-sensitive function. In addition,
if an individual has a verified positive drug test result or has refused to submit to a drug test, the employer cannot
use the individual to perform any safety-sensitive function unless and until the appropriate MRO or SAP evaluation
and return to duty requirements have been met. (A similar prohibition applies under the alcohol misuse prevention
program, 14 CFR part 121, appendix J). Information regarding such unresolved violations can be obtained only from
the employee's records. In summary, the FAA does not view the need to ensure that an applicant is not subject to the permanent
bar as materially different from the other requirements in this employer-based, employer-implemented program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has addressed one concern raised by commenters regarding the availability of records from previous employers.
The confidentiality provisions have been revised to clarify that employers are required to release employee antidrug
program records upon written consent of the employee. This revision precludes prior employers from refusing to release
records and thereby frustrating the intent of this regulation. With respect to record retention, the FAA notes that
the retention periods provided in this rule are minimums and employers may choose to retain any records for a longer
period of time. Employers should consider longer retention of information regarding verified positive drug test
results, refusals to submit to testing, evaluation, and rehabilitation, if for no other reason than to ensure that
an individual previously terminated for violating the rule is not rehired for and impermissibly returned to the performance
of safety-sensitive functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also expressed concern that employees be provided with adequate notice of the implications of having
a verified positive drug test result or using drugs while performing a safety-sensitive function. The FAA agrees
that employees should be advised of the consequences of such actions, and of the consequences of refusing to submit
to a required test (which, although it does not implicate the permanent bar, does necessitate removal from safety-sensitive
functions and possible reporting to the FAA). The FAA has therefore revised the employee assistance program provisions
of appendix I to include a requirement that the employer policy provide information on the consequences under the
antidrug rule of illegal use of drugs, verified positive drug test results, and refusals to submit to testing. It should
be noted that an employer may advise employees of any consequences imposed under the employer's independent authority
(e.g., termination); however, the employer could not purport or imply that the FAA's antidrug rule required such
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permanent bar following a refusal to undertake or failure to complete rehabilitation is further implemented
by retaining the current requirement that prior to returning to duty performing safety-sensitive functions following
a verified positive drug test result on an FAA-mandated drug test or refusal to submit to such a drug test, the employee
must be evaluated by the MRO on the specific issue of compliance with any previously-established treatment program.
This rule retains the provisions regarding MRO recommendations for return to duty, with the modification that, based
on the requirements of the Act, the MRO cannot recommend return to duty if an individual has failed to comply with a specified
rehabilitation program. The FAA has chosen, however, not to impose a definite time period during which the employee
must agree to undertake or complete the prescribed rehabilitation. This allows for the denial phase that most people
go through when first confronted with evidence of a drug problem.

Split Specimen Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Split specimen testing, which is expressly required under the Act, is a procedure under which an original urine specimen
is divided into two containers, each of which is sealed, labeled, and maintained separately. If the primary specimen
tests positive, the split or secondary specimen can be tested to ensure that the confirmed positive was not caused
by error or tampering. In accordance with the requirements of the Act, DOT has revised its procedural rule to require
split specimen testing for all drug testing performed under the auspices of the FAA antidrug rule (and those of the
Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration).
Consistent with the provisions of the DOT rule, this final rule provides that split specimen testing is in lieu of the
right to request a retest of the original specimen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters objected to the split specimen testing requirement as unnecessary and unduly burdensome.
These commenters stated that split specimen provisions should not be included in the final rule. The FAA is constrained
by the requirements of the Act and must provide for split specimen testing. All aviation entities with FAA-approved
antidrug programs must therefore ensure that they have split specimen testing provisions in place by August 15, 1994,
including providing appropriate amendments to their antidrug program plans to the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the Act and the DOT's revised rule provide that an employee is entitled to split specimen testing if the employee
requests such testing within 3 days of receiving notice of the positive drug test result, and this final rule incorporates
an analogous provision. The NPRM proposed that the request must be in writing. Commenters noted that the requirement
for a written request conflicts with the limited time available during which to make the request to have a split specimen
tested. The FAA has deleted the proposed requirement that an employee request the split specimen test in writing.
The final rule also revises the provision regarding MRO verification of the primary specimen. The NPRM proposed that
the MRO ``may'' proceed with verification pending receipt of the split specimen test result. Although this language
was permissive, it was not the intent of the FAA that verification could be delayed solely based on an employee's request
for a split specimen test. Rather, the provision was intended to recognize that factors other than the request for
the split specimen analysis could affect the verification process. The final rule makes the intent of the FAA explicit.
Finally, the rule provides that no employer or agency action is stayed during the request period or while waiting for
a split specimen test result.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM included a notice that in the final rule the FAA would amend the antidrug rule to change the terms ``passing''
and ``failing'' a drug test. All of the DOT agencies that require drug testing, including the FAA, have received reports
of some confusion in their respective industries regarding the use of the terms passing and failing a drug test and
how those terms relate to different drug test results (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, confirmed or verified positive or negative test, cancelled tests, etc.). The final rule changes these terms wherever
they are used throughout the antidrug rule to the more accurate ``verified positive'' or ``verified negative.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the revised appendix I published in this final rule includes a number of minor editorial changes. For
example, throughout the antidrug rule the phrase ``functions specified in section III of appendix I'' is used. This
final rule replaces that phrase with the term ``safety-sensitive function,'' which is defined accordingly.

As was noted in the preamble to the NPRM, when the FAA's final antidrug rule was published in 1988, air traffic control
(ATC) facilities operated under contract with the FAA were explicitly excluded from coverage under the rule. It was
subsequently determined that employees of contract ATC facilities would not be included in the FAA's program for
Federal employees and should be subject to the FAA's rules for the aviation industry. This final rule changes the definition
of covered employers to include such facilities. The FAA's air traffic control facilities and facilities operated
by the military (whether directly or by contract) are not affected by this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air traffic control facilities, whether they are currently required to perform testing by contract or not, should
submit plans to the FAA within 90 days after the rule's effective date, as required by paragraph A.5., Section IX.

The final antidrug rule included amendments to the airmen certification sections of the FAA's regulations under
which a refusal to submit to testing could be the basis for a certificate action. However, the rule did not have an express
requirement for employers to notify the FAA of refusals or a specific mechanism for providing such notice. The NPRM
proposed a reporting requirement that (paragraph E of section VI of appendix I to part 121) would correct this gap in
the requirements of the rule. However, the proposal did not include a specific time for notifications. The final rule
specifies that employers must notify the FAA of refusals to submit to required tests within 5 working days. The final
rule also clarifies that sanctions do not attach to refusals to submit to either pre-employment or return to duty tests
since the redefinition of ``return to duty tests'' makes such tests essentially voluntary. An individual who refuses
to submit to pre-employment or return to duty testing but then wishes to perform a safety-sensitive function would
have to subsequently agree to take and have a verified negative drug test result on such a test. The individual would
then be subject to follow-up testing while performing safety-sensitive functions, because the individual might
have refused based on recent drug use. The individual would not, however, be subject to certificate action for declining
what is essentially a test taken voluntarily as a precondition to performing safety-sensitive duties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule modifies the specified safety-sensitive duties slightly to parallel the classes of covered functions
in the FAA's new alcohol misuse prevention program rule (14 CFR part 121, appendix J). This modification is not intended
to significantly change the antidrug rule's coverage. The most significant changes are the elimination of flight
test and ground instruction duties. The former category is eliminated because the FAA has determined that as a practical
matter, these duties are essentially subsumed in flight crewmember or flight instructor duties. Ground instruction
duties have been eliminated based on the FAA's desire to reduce the burden of the antidrug rule on the industry and the
determination that individuals performing such duties could be removed from the program without jeopardizing public
safety. Additionally, the categories of ``aviation screening duties'' and ``ground security coordinator duties''
have been established to clarify the FAA's original intent with respect to covered security functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although most commenters supported these changes, one commenter believed that rather than specifying categories
of safety-sensitive duties, the rule should provide the Administrator with the discretion to establish these categories
without rulemaking. The FAA has not adopted this recommendation. While flexibility might be desirable, the FAA believes
that it is essential that adequate notice and opportunity for comment be given to individuals the FAA intends to subject
to the requirements of this rule. Publication of the safety-sensitive functions as part of the final rule also ensures
that affected employees and employers have actual or constructive knowledge of the requirements of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has previously received a petition for rulemaking on the issue of the appropriate scope of covered employees
under the antidrug rule. Because the issues raised in the petition have been resolved in this final rule, the FAA has
closed this action. (Docket No. 26620) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the covered employee categories are being revised, we are republishing with this final rule the Drug Testing
Management Information System (MIS) Data Collection Forms, which were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 23, 1993 (58 FR 68198), and became effective on January 1, 1994. These forms provide the FAA with additional
data for use in monitoring the antidrug program and reflect the changes in employees covered by the antidrug rule.
There are no other significant changes to the forms.

Pre-Employment Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed to revise the antidrug rule's pre-employment testing provision (paragraph A of section V of appendix
I) to make the provision less burdensome. When it was published in 1988, the antidrug rule required pre-employment
testing before an individual could be hired to perform a function specified in appendix I. As interpreted by the FAA,
testing was required of individuals not currently employed by the employer, of current employees moving from a non-covered
to a covered safety-sensitive function, and in circumstances where an employee was removed from the random testing
pool for any length of time or was unavailable for testing for an extended period of time. Individuals who had a verified
positive drug test result or refused to submit to an FAA-mandated drug test also had to pass a pre-employment test prior
to performing or returning to safety-sensitive duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA continues to believe that pre-employment drug testing has utility for those individuals who have not previously
been subject to the FAA-approved random drug testing program of an employer. However, we have reassessed the need
for pre-employment testing in other situations, such as when an employee has been on leave of absence or working outside
the territory of the United States. The FAA believes, and all of the commenters addressing this issue concur, that
safety can be maintained even if the requirement for pre-employment testing in some circumstances is eliminated.
Therefore, the FAA has revised its antidrug rule to require pre-employment testing of an individual only prior to
the first time the individual performs a safety-sensitive function for an employer. Such an individual must have
a verified negative drug test result on a pre-employment test prior to performing a safety-sensitive function, and
the employer could not permit the individual to perform such a function until the employer receives the verified negative
pre-employment drug test result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employers would be permitted to require an employee to submit to pre-employment testing in cases where an employee
previously subject to random testing by that employer has been removed from the random testing pool for reasons other
than a verified positive drug test result on an FAA-mandated drug test or refusal to submit to such testing.

Return to Duty and Follow-Up Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1988 final antidrug rule included the category of ``testing after return to duty'' (former paragraph F, section
V, appendix I). Under this provision, individuals who had been hired to perform safety-sensitive functions, or returned
to the performance of safety-sensitive functions after receiving a verified positive drug test result on or refusing
to submit to an FAA-mandated drug test, were subject to unannounced testing. As noted above, the threshold test required
before returning to duty was characterized as a pre-employment test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters concurred with the FAA's assessment that the FAA's prior use of the term ``return to duty'' testing has
caused confusion in the industry. The FAA also wishes to ensure consistency in terminology with the alcohol misuse
prevention program rule. For these reasons, the antidrug rule has been revised to provide that an individual who had
a verified positive drug test result on a pre-employment test, or refused a pre-employment test, must take another
pre-employment test and obtain a verified negative drug test result before performing safety-sensitive duties
and would then be subject to follow-up testing. An employee who had a verified positive drug test result on another
type of test or refused to submit to another type of test (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, random) must take a return to duty test and obtain a verified negative drug test result before returning to the performance
of safety-sensitive duties, and would then be subject to follow-up testing. Like all FAA-mandated tests, return
to duty and follow-up tests must be performed in accordance with the requirements of appendix I and the testing procedures
in 49 CFR part 40. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also proposed two other changes that would parallel the provisions of the alcohol rule. The first proposed
change was the addition of a mandatory minimum of six follow-up drug tests during an individual's first 12 months after
being hired for or returning to the performance of safety-sensitive functions after the individual has refused to
submit to or had a verified positive drug test result on an FAA-mandated test. Commenters generally opposed this proposal,
believing the determination of the appropriate number of follow-up tests should be a matter for the MRO's discretion.
Based on these comments, the FAA has revised the follow-up testing provision. As revised, although follow-up testing
is required for any person who refuses to submit to or who has a verified positive drug test result on an FAA-mandated
drug test, a minimum of six tests over 12 months will be required only for an individual who is determined in an evaluation
conducted under this rule to be in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with illegal use of drugs. This
modification ensures that those employees most in need of monitoring will be subject to at least a minimum number of
tests over the first year after returning to duty, the period during which recidivism is the most likely to occur. The
remaining employees would be tested at the MRO's discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second change permits the employer to direct the individual to undergo alcohol testing, as well as drug testing,
if the Medical Review Officer determines that such testing would be appropriate. No commenters addressed this change,
and the final rule includes this provision as it was proposed.

Medical Review Officer Functions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed to substantially revise section VII of appendix I. First, changes in the DOT final rule (49 CFR part
40), which establishes the duties of the MRO in the verification process, have superseded the FAA's rule. Rather than
reiterate the duplicative provisions of the DOT rule, which are subject to change, the revised MRO section cites to
the applicable provisions of the DOT rule and incorporates them (and therefore any future amendments) by reference.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MRO duties have been revised to require the MRO to inquire whether an individual holds a part 67 airman medical certificate,
to process requests for split specimen testing, and to evaluate or refer the individual to a SAP for evaluation, as
discussed previously. The MRO's duties in the case of an employee or applicant who holds a part 67 airman medical certificate
or who would be required to hold such a certificate to perform a safety-sensitive function for an employer are also
specified. In response to comments, the requirements for submission of the reports to the Federal Air Surgeon have
been revised. The final rule provides that an MRO has 10 working days following verification of a positive drug test
result in which to make a determination regarding drug dependence. All documents pertaining to the test result, verification,
dependency, SAP evaluations, and return to duty recommendations, if any, must be forwarded to the Federal Air Surgeon
within 12 working days of verifying the positive drug test result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also includes specific recordkeeping requirements for the MRO. This change makes explicit the previously
implicit requirement that MROs maintain records necessary for accomplishing their duties. While the records are
created on behalf of and remain the employers' records, the new recordkeeping section reflects the fact that, of necessity,
there are records that must be maintained by the MRO if the MRO is to fulfill his or her regulatory role. The provision
regarding forwarding of MRO records has been revised slightly from the NPRM to clarify that it is the employer's obligation
to ensure that MRO records are forwarded to a new MRO, even if the employer is obtaining MRO services through a consortium.
The change reflects the FAA's position that records associated with a particular employer's antidrug program remain
the employer's records, even if the records are maintained by the MRO and even if the employer does not contract directly
with the MRO. The FAA recognizes that a consortium may effect the actual transfer of records; however, the consortium
does so only as an agent of the employers using its services to implement their programs.

Antidrug Program Plan Submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several changes were proposed in this NPRM to the plan submission provisions. First, the address to which plans and
plan amendments must be submitted has been changed to reflect the Drug Abatement Division's current address. Second,
the ``transition'' provisions of the rule for new aviation employers (paragraph A., section IX) have been changed
to eliminate the substantial grace period previously provided. Commenters supported the FAA's view that given the
published guidance available from the FAA and from private sector entities and the wealth of material and experience
now available, there is no longer a reason to permit carriers to begin operations without having implemented an FAA-approved
antidrug program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA noted in the preamble to the final rule that the compliance deadlines for new businesses might be accelerated
in the future (53 FR 47043; November 21, 1988), and, accordingly, this final rule prohibits covered employers from
beginning operations without an approved antidrug program. The program must be implemented, and all covered employees
subject to testing, not later than the inception of operations. Any person hired by a new certificate holder to perform
a safety-sensitive function after the issuance of the certificate must undergo pre-employment testing. Additionally,
each new employer must ensure that employees performing safety-sensitive functions by contract are subject to an
FAA-approved antidrug program within 60 days of the implementation of the employer's program. This requirement
will impose no significant burden on new operators and any burden is outweighed by the benefits gained by public safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the consortium plan submission section has been revised to require that each consortium program must provide
for notification to the FAA of changes in membership. Finally, a new provision (section IX, paragraph A.6.) expressly
states that covered employers must ensure that they are continuously covered under an approved antidrug program.
This new section reflects the FAA's recognition of the fluid nature of the aviation industry, in which locations,
contracts, and even corporate identities are subject to frequent changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the preamble to the NPRM, the original antidrug rule published in 1988 applied to employees performing
safety-sensitive functions for the specified employers regardless of whether the employees were located within
the territory of the United States or were located in a foreign country. In recognition of the international implications
of the rule, however, the effective date of the rule with respect to employees located outside the territory of the
United States was deferred on a number of occasions. Significant practical and legal concerns surrounding implementation
of the antidrug rule outside the territory of the United States remain and the FAA has substantially revised the international
section of the antidrug rule (section XII, appendix I).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the proposed rule, this final rule provides that no employee located outside the territory of the
United States shall be tested for illegal use of drugs under the provisions of appendix I. To ensure proper selection
for random testing, an employer must remove from the random testing pool any employee assigned to perform safety-sensitive
functions solely outside the territory of the United States, since such an employee is not available for testing.
The employee must be returned to the random testing pool as soon as the employee once more begins to perform functions
wholly or partially within the territory of the United States. As noted above, the employer has the option of requiring
the employee to undergo a pre-employment test prior to returning to the performance of a safety-sensitive function
within the territory of the United States (and therefore to the random testing pool). This section also provides that
the provisions of appendix I do not apply to employees performing safety-sensitive functions by contract outside
the territory of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although most commenters supported this revision, one commenter expressed concern that employees performing safety-sensitive
functions within the territory of the United States may be subject to random testing at a disproportionately high
rate if employees outside the territory of the United States are excused from testing and that employees taken out
of the random testing pool may pose a safety risk. The FAA is cognizant of concerns about safety and economic parity
that are raised by this exclusion. However, the FAA has determined that the burdens associated with extraterritorial
testing outweigh the possible safety benefit. The FAA expects that employers will ensure that persons performing
safety-sensitive functions wholly or partially within the territory of the United States remain subject to an effective
random testing program. Finally, employers concerned about drug use by employees removed from the random testing
pool may, as addressed above, subject such employees to pre-employment testing prior to permitting the employees
to perform safety-sensitive functions within the territory of the United States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Types of Drug Testing Required.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each employer shall conduct the following types of testing in accordance with the procedures set forth in this appendix
and the DOT ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' (49 CFR part 40): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pre-employment Testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Prior to the first time an individual performs a safety-sensitive function for an employer, the employer shall
require the individual to undergo testing for prohibited drug use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. An employer is permitted to require pre-employment testing of an individual if the following criteria are met:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The individual previously performed a covered function for the employer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The employer removed the individual from the employer's random testing program conducted under this appendix
for reasons other than a verified positive test result on an FAA-mandated drug test or a refusal to submit to such testing;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The individual will be returning to the performance of a safety-sensitive function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. No employer shall allow an individual required to undergo pre-employment testing under section V, paragraphs
A.1 or A.2 of this appendix to perform a safety-sensitive function unless the employer has received a verified negative
drug test result for the individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The employer shall advise each individual applying to perform a safety-sensitive function at the time of application
that the individual will be required to undergo pre-employment testing to determine the presence of marijuana, cocaine,
opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs in the individual's system. The employer
shall provide this same notification to each individual required by the employer to undergo pre-employment testing
under section V, paragraph A.(2) of this appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Periodic Testing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function for an employer and who is required to undergo a medical examination
under part 67 of this chapter shall submit to a periodic drug test. The employee shall be tested for the presence of marijuana,
cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs during the first calendar
year of implementation of the employer's antidrug program. The tests shall be conducted in conjunction with the first
medical evaluation of the employee or in accordance with an alternative method for collecting periodic test specimens
detailed in an employer's approved antidrug program. An employer may discontinue periodic testing of its employees
after the first calendar year of implementation of the employer's antidrug program when the employer has implemented
an unannounced testing program based on random selection of employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Random Testing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each employer shall randomly select employees who perform a safety-sensitive function for the employer for unannounced
drug testing. The employer shall randomly select employees for unannounced testing for the presence of marijuana,
cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs in an employee's system
using a random number table or a computer-based, number generator that is matched with an employee's social security
number, payroll identification number, or any other alternative method approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) During the first 12 months following implementation of unannounced testing based on random selection pursuant
to this appendix, an employer shall meet the following conditions:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Post-accident Testing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each employer shall test each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function for the presence of marijuana, cocaine,
opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs in the employee's system if that employee's
performance either contributed to an accident or can not be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the
accident. The employee shall be tested as soon as possible but not later than 32 hours after the accident. The decision
not to administer a test under this section must be based on a determination, using the best information available
at the time of the determination, that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident. The
employee shall submit to post-accident testing under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Testing Based on Reasonable Cause.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each employer shall test each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function and who is reasonably suspected
of using a prohibited drug. Each employer shall test an employee's specimen for the presence of marijuana, cocaine,
opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs. An employer may test an employee's
specimen for the presence of other prohibited drugs or drug metabolites only in accordance with this appendix and
the DOT ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' (49 CFR part 40). At least two of the employee's
supervisors, one of whom is trained in detection of the symptoms of possible drug use, shall substantiate and concur
in the decision to test an employee who is reasonably suspected of drug use; provided, however, that in the case of an
employer other than a part 121 certificate holder who employs 50 or fewer employees who perform safety-sensitive
functions, one supervisor who is trained in detection of symptoms of possible drug use shall substantiate the decision
to test an employee who is reasonably suspected of drug use. The decision to test must be based on a reasonable and articulable
belief that the employee is using a prohibited drug on the basis of specific contemporaneous physical, behavioral,
or performance indicators of probable drug use.

Follow-up Testing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each employer shall implement a reasonable program of unannounced testing of each individual who has been hired to
perform or who has been returned to the performance of a safety-sensitive function after refusing to submit to a drug
test required by this appendix or receiving a verified positive drug test result on a test conducted under this appendix.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The number and frequency of such testing shall be determined by the employer's Medical Review Officer. In the case
of any individual evaluated under this appendix and determined to be in need of assistance in resolving problems associated
with illegal use of drugs, follow-up testing shall consist of at least six tests in the first 12 months following the
employee's return to duty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The employer may direct the employee to undergo testing for alcohol, in addition to drugs, if the Medical Review
Officer determines that alcohol testing is necessary for the particular employee. Any such alcohol testing shall
be conducted in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR part 40. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months after the date the individual begins to perform or returns to the performance
of a safety-sensitive function. The Medical Review Officer may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing
at any time after the first six tests have been conducted, if the Medical Review Officer determines that such testing
is no longer necessary.

amend specific portions of the published text, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions, required practices, and the reporting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping requirements; to adopt recently amended industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards; and to clarify the meaning and applicability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various terms. This action will affect the sellers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerant, aid the affected community, and may provide relief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to certain segments of the affected community.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations should substantially reduce the emissions of ozone-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depleting refrigerants. The regulations require that persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicing air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment observe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain service practices that reduce emissions, and establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment and reclamation certification requirements, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a technician certification requirement. A sales restriction on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sale of refrigerant was also established by the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. As of November 14, 1994, only certified technicians 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will legally be authorized to purchase refrigerant.

 In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the final regulations established a leak repair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for equipment that normally holds a refrigerant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charge of fifty pounds or more. Finally, the regulations require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ozone-depleting compounds contained in appliances be removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to disposal of the appliances, and that all air- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioning and refrigeration equipment, except for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appliances, be provided with a servicing aperture that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate recovery of refrigerant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 82.152(x) defines a ``technician'' for purposes of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerant recycling rule. A technician is a person who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides maintenance, service or repair that could reasonably be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to release ozone-depleting substances through those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions. Section 82.152(x) includes in the definition of ``technician'' a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person who disposes of appliances, but does not include any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person disposing of small appliances. In excluding such persons, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered the nature of work associated with recovering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerants from small appliances prior to disposal, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected workforce, and any environmental damage that could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result from emissions during disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In drafting the final rule, EPA left out motor vehicle air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioners (MVAC)
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and MVAC-like equipment
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 in exempting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification of technicians disposing of certain types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. Disposal of MVACs and MVAC-like appliances is similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in many ways to the disposal of small appliances. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguishes between large equipment that is dismantled on-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and portable equipment that may enter the waste stream with its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerant charge still intact because of the differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the two types of equipment once they reach the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their useful lives. Large equipment dismantled on-site must have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerant removed as part of the dismantling process because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is no other option that will result in successful recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of refrigerant. This large equipment cannot enter the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream with the charge intact, while more portable small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appliances, MVACs, and MVAC-like equipment frequently does enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the waste stream with the charge intact.

MVAC-like equipment is defined in &sect;82.152(1) as the mechanical vapor compression, open-drive compressor
appliances used to cool the driver's or passenger's compartment of a non-road motor vehicle. This includes the air-conditioning
equipment on agricultural or construction vehicles. This definition is not intended to cover appliances using HCFC&hyph;22
refrigerant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In regulations promulgated under section 608, EPA discussed the differences between the disposal sector and the
servicing sector. (See 58 FR 28705.) EPA noted that unlike the servicing sector, the disposal sector does not reintroduce
refrigerant to equipment, after removal. Refrigerant is merely being removed, usually after the appliances have
been removed from operation. This removal may occur at any stage either before it enters the waste stream or once in
the waste stream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the types of recover-only processes used with small appliances, MVACs, and MVAC-like equipment tend to be relatively
straight-forward and a simpler task than recycling or the recovery of refrigerant from larger types of appliances,
EPA did not require the certification of technicians disposing of small appliances. Since the circumstances for
disposing of small appliances is quite similar to the circumstances for disposing of MVACs and MVAC-like equipment,
EPA believes it is appropriate to revise the definition of ``technician'' to exclude any person disposing of MVAC
and MVAC-like equipment. The revised definition will consequently read as follows: ``Technician means any person
who performs maintenance, service, or repair that could reasonably be expected to release class I or class II substances
from appliances into the atmosphere, including but not limited to installers, contractor employees, in-house service
personnel, and in some cases, owners. Technician also means any person disposing of appliances except for small appliances,
MVACs, and MVAC-like equipment.''

2. Adoption of Standard Based on ARI 700&hyph;1993 in Definition of ``Reclaim'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 82.152(q) defines ``reclaim'' to mean ``to reprocess refrigerant to at least the standard of purity specified
in the ARI Standard 700&hyph;1988, Specifications for Fluorocarbon Refrigerants.'' A standard based closely on
ARI 700&hyph;1988 is included in the rule as Appendix A. During the comment period on the proposed &sect;608 refrigerant
recycling rule, the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute had requested that EPA adopt a standard based
on ARI 700&hyph;1993, which is an updated version of ARI 700&hyph;1988. ARI described the differences between ARI
700&hyph;1988 and ARI 700&hyph;1993 during the public hearing and submitted a draft version of the updated standard,
which was included in the public docket for the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The updated standard included changes in three areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. ARI 700&hyph;1993 included purity standards for eleven additional refrigerants: R&hyph;23, R&hyph;32, R&hyph;123,
R&hyph;124, R&hyph;125, R&hyph;134a, R&hyph;143a, R&hyph;401(A), R&hyph;401(B), R&hyph;402(A), and R&hyph;402(B).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Liquid phase contaminant water levels were increased from 10ppm in ARI 700&hyph;1988 to 20ppm in ARI 700&hyph;1993
for R&hyph;11 and R&hyph;113 only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Where ARI 700&hyph;1988 allowed 0.5 as the maximum percentage by weight of ``other refrigerants,'' ARI 700&hyph;1993
allows 0.50 as the maximum percentage by weight of ``all other organic impurities, including other refrigerants.''
The inclusion of organic impurities other than refrigerants in the limit effectively tightens the standard, and
at the same time, the change from 0.5 to 0.50 reduces the tolerance of the standard by a factor of ten. (Thus, while a sample
containing 0.54 percent other refrigerants would have met the old standard, only a sample containing 0.504 percent
(or less) other organic impurities would meet the new standard.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although all the comments received by EPA regarding adoption of the updated standard were favorable, the standard
was not included in the final rule because it was not finalized by the time the final rule was published. (See 58 FR 28679
for a discussion of this issue in the final rule.) An appendix to the standard specifying procedures for analyzing
refrigerant was undergoing a lengthy process of peer review, which is now complete. Because the final standard is
substantially identical to the draft that was included in the docket for comment, and because EPA agrees with commenters
that the changes to the standard are appropriate and necessary, EPA is changing the definition of ``reclaim'' to refer
to ARI 700&hyph;1993, and is replacing the standard based on ARI 700&hyph;1988 with a standard based on ARI 700&hyph;1993
as appendix A. EPA is also replacing references to ARI 700&hyph;1988 with references to ARI 700&hyph;1993 in its reclaimer
certification program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because section 608 of the Act does not give EPA the authority to regulate refrigerants that do not contain class I or
class II substances until November, 1995, EPA is not adopting the purity standards of ARI 700&hyph;1993 that apply
to refrigerants that do not contain CFCs or HCFCs. Thus, EPA is not adopting purity requirements for HFC&hyph;23,
HFC&hyph;32, HFC&hyph;125, HFC&hyph;134a, or HFC&hyph;143a at this time. (ARI and other standard-setting organizations
remain free, of course, to adopt and observe purity requirements for these refrigerants.) However, the purity requirements
for CFC and HCFC refrigerants (including blends that contain either CFCs or HCFCs along with non-ozone-depleting
components) in appendix A are identical to the purity requirements for CFC and HCFC refrigerants in ARI 700&hyph;1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA would like to clarify that since it is not possible to return a refrigerant to a standard of purity if no standard
of purity is specified for that refrigerant, refrigerants that are not covered by appendix A need not be reclaimed
under this regulation.

1. Sale of Used Appliances Without Service Apertures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 82.154(j) and &sect;82.154(k) are prohibitions against the sale and distribution, or offer for sale and
distribution of any appliance, unless such equipment is equipped with either a service aperture or, for small appliances,
with a process stub, to facilitate the removal of refrigerant. EPA would like to clarify that for the purposes of these
prohibitions, EPA will interpret sale, distribution, or offer of sale or distribution as not referring to the sale
of used products. Sale of used products means a sale or distribution by a person after a period of use other than demonstration
use. The Agency recognizes that there is a market for the sale of used air conditioners and refrigerators. Restricting
the resale of such used durable goods before the end of their productive lifetimes would provide little, if any, environmental
benefit. Indeed, the introduction of a service aperture may lead to unintentional releases by weakening the refrigeration
circuit. Because requiring these goods to be retrofitted prior to resale would impose significant economic hardship
on a great many consumers without providing significant environmental benefits, EPA does not believe it is necessary
to ban their resale. Consequently, while EPA's interpretation of sale and distribution or offer for sale and distribution
is such that the entire chain of sale and distribution from the manufacturer of a new product to its ultimate consumer
is included, the Agency recognizes that in the case of durable consumer goods, resale of the product to additional
consumers may occur after the original sale or distribution of the new product to the ultimate consumer after some
period of use by the original ultimate consumer. In such cases, EPA will not prohibit the sale of these used products.

2. Exceptions to Prohibition on Sale of Unreclaimed Refrigerant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prohibitions &sect;&sect;82.154(g) and 82.154(h) currently prohibit the sale of used refrigerant that has not
been reclaimed by a certified reclaimer. EPA intended to exclude two classes of used refrigerant from this prohibition:
refrigerant that was and is to be used only in an MVAC or MVAC-like appliance, and refrigerant that is contained in an
appliance that is sold or offered for sale together with the refrigerant. The section 609 refrigerant recycling rule,
which covers MVACs, explicitly recognizes and permits the transfer of refrigerant between MVACs owned by different
persons if that refrigerant is: (1) Recovered from an MVAC and returned to an MVAC by a single service entity; and (2)
recycled to meet the SAE J1991 standard.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 (This provision of the section 609 rule, which is contained in the definition of ``properly using'' recycling and
recovery equipment, also covers MVAC-like appliances pursuant to &sect;82.156(a)(5).) Because this standard
is not as stringent as the standard that reclaimed refrigerant must meet in the section 608 refrigerant recycling
rule, refrigerant that only meets this standard cannot be considered reclaimed. Thus, such refrigerant cannot be
sold under the section 608 rule. However, EPA did not intend to reverse the position that it took in the section 609 rule
regarding the transfer of refrigerant between MVACs owned by different people. For instance, one of the primary arguments
made in support of the reclamation requirement in the section 608 rule, that no less stringent recycling standard
currently exists (58 FR 28679), clearly does not apply to MVACs and MVAC-like appliances, which are governed by the
less stringent SAE J1991 standard. EPA is therefore amending the prohibitions to exclude the sale of refrigerant
transferred between MVACs or MVAC-like appliances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The preamble to the section 609 rule states, ``service establishments owned by a single owner may recover refrigerant
and send the refrigerant to a central location for recycling to the SAE J1991 standard for CFC&hyph;12'' (57 FR 31246).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another primary argument made in support of the reclamation requirement, that transfer of refrigerant between different
owners can contaminate appliances, clearly does not apply to refrigerant that changes ownership solely because
it is contained in an appliance that changes ownership. If refrigerant remains within a single appliance, it obviously
cannot introduce contaminants into another appliance. Thus, EPA is also amending the prohibition to exclude the
sale of refrigerant that is contained in an appliance that is sold or offered for sale together with the refrigerant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 82.156(a)(2)(ii) establishes an exception to the evacuation requirements for appliances undergoing maintenance,
service, or repair. The paragraph reads: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, due to leaks in the appliance, evacuation to the levels in Table 1 is not attainable, or would substantially contaminate
the refrigerant being recovered, persons opening the appliance must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Isolate leaking from non-leaking components wherever possible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Evacuate non-leaking components to be opened to the levels specified in Table 1; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Evacuate leaking components to be opened to the lowest level that can be attained without substantially contaminating
the refrigerant. In no case shall this level exceed 0 psig. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through an accidental omission, the requirements in &sect;82.156(a)(3) for evacuating appliances at disposal
contain no exception for leaky appliances, although the rationale for such an exception at disposal is identical
to the rationale for the exception at maintenance, service, or repair. That is, leaks in the appliance may permit air
to enter the appliance as the internal pressure of the appliance is lowered, contaminating the refrigerant being
recovered and making it impossible to attain the required vacuum. EPA is therefore adding an exception for leaky appliances
to the evacuation requirements at disposal. This exception is identical to that at maintenance, service, and repair.

2. Use of Nitrogen to Pressurize &hyph;113 Appliances for Non-Major Repairs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 82.156(a)(2)(B) prohibits the use of nitrogen to pressurize low-pressure appliances for non-major repairs.
In including this prohibition in the rule, EPA intended to encourage the use of pressurization methods that do not
require subsequent purging, such as heating of the evaporator and/or condenser. However, while heat can be safely
used to pressurize appliances utilizing CFC&hyph;11 and HCFC&hyph;123 to atmospheric pressure, heat alone is not
a practical or safe method for pressurizing appliances utilizing CFC&hyph;113 because the temperatures required
to raise the pressure of CFC&hyph;113 to atmospheric pressure are quite high (117.6 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F for CFC&hyph;113 vs. 74.7 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F for CFC&hyph;11). Thus, for refrigerants with boiling points above 85 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, EPA is now requiring that heat be used to raise the internal pressure of the appliance as much as possible, but
is permitting nitrogen to be introduced to meet the remaining pressure requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to popular perception, EPA has never prohibited the use of nitrogen to pressurize systems for purposes of
a leak check (because leak checking does not involve ``opening'' of the appliance), although the Agency encourages
the use of heat, rather than nitrogen, to pressurize systems whenever possible. Thus, it has been and remains acceptable
to introduce nitrogen into an appliance utilizing CFC&hyph;113 for purposes of a leak check. EPA recommends that
heat be the primary method used to raise the internal pressure of appliances containing CFC&hyph;113 as much as possible
for checking leaks, and that nitrogen be introduced to meet the remaining pressure requirements.

3. Requirements for Recovery Using New Recovery Technologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;82.158(b)(2), EPA provided for the certification of recycling and recovery equipment whose recovery efficiency
cannot be tested according to the procedures in ARI 740&hyph;1993, which measure levels of evacuation. The rule states
that this new equipment may be certified if an approved third-party testing organization adopts and performs a test
that demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the recovery efficiency of the new equipment is
equal to or better than that of equipment that: (i) Is intended for use with the same type of appliance; and (ii) achieves
the level of evacuation in Table 2 of the rule. As discussed in the preamble to the final rule (58 FR 28689), EPA's goal
in including this provision was to avoid unnecessary delay in the certification, marketing, and use of new recovery
technologies that do not operate by drawing vacuums. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA inadvertently neglected to include a provision in the required practices section (82.156) that would
permit the use of recovery technologies that do not operate by drawing vacuums. EPA is therefore adding a provision,
&sect;82.156(a)(2)(iii), that permits the use of equipment certified pursuant to &sect;82.158(b)(2), as long
as users of this equipment follow the manufacturer's directions for achieving the required recovery efficiencies.
EPA will make the development of and compliance with such directions part of the process for certifying new recovery
technologies under &sect;82.158(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Availability of Certified Recycling and Recovery Equipment to Persons Disposing of MVACs and MVAC-Like Appliances

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 82.156(b) currently requires that: All persons opening appliances except for small appliances and MVACs
for maintenance, service, or repair and all persons disposing of appliances except for small appliances must have
at least one piece of certified, self-contained recovery equipment available at their place of business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA inadvertently omitted three items from this paragraph. First, certified, self-contained recycling equipment
should have been listed along with certified, self-contained recovery equipment as equipment that would meet this
requirement. In all other sections of the rule, recycling and recovery equipment are treated identically, and EPA
did not intend to treat them differently here. Therefore, EPA is inserting ``or recycling'' between ``recovery''
and ``equipment'' in &sect;82.156(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, persons disposing of MVACs and MVAC-like appliances should have been excluded along with persons disposing
of small appliances from the requirement to have one piece of certified, self-contained recovery or recycling equipment
available at their place of business. EPA clearly intended to exclude these persons from this requirement because
it excludes recovery and recycling equipment used to dispose MVACs and MVAC-like equipment from third-party certification
requirements. (See the final rule preamble at 58 FR 28705, &sect;&sect;82.158(a) and 82.158(l).) Therefore, EPA
is inserting ``MVACs, or MVAC-like appliances'' after ``all persons disposing of appliances except for small appliances,''
excluding all three groups from the requirement to have certified recovery or recycling equipment available at their
place of business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, EPA intended to exempt persons who own appliances containing pump-out units and who maintain, service, repair,
or dispose of only these appliances from the above requirement. The requirement was intended to ensure that persons
who used small, portable system-dependent recovery equipment to service appliances also had self-contained equipment
available in the event the appliance compressor was not operational. In general, such small, self-contained recovery
equipment is not prohibitively expensive, particularly if it is to be used for a large number of jobs. However, the
requirement may also affect owners of chillers, which are frequently equipped with built-in pump-out units that
are used for the recovery of large quantities of refrigerant. Because system compressors may be used to move the refrigerant
into the pump-out unit in some cases, these units may be considered ``system-dependent'' in those cases.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 While small self-contained recovery devices are relatively inexpensive, larger self-contained recovery devices
may be prohibitively costly for persons who own and service a limited number of chillers. Moreover, instead of purchasing
large recovery devices, owners of chillers may contract out the recovery procedure if the built-in unit is not capable
of meeting the applicable evacuation requirements. EPA did not intend to require such owners to purchase expensive
equipment when this less costly remedy exists. Thus, EPA is adding a sentence to make this exemption explicit. However,
persons exempted from &sect;82.156(b) are still required to meet the other applicable requirements of &sect;82.156
(e.g., evacuation requirements).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA understands that in general, pump-out units on chillers are equipped with their own pumps or compressors, which
are not used during the operation of the appliance. Pump-out units equipped with their own compressors would not be
considered system-dependent recovery equipment. On the other hand, system receivers, which are not equipped with
their own compressors, would not be considered recovery equipment at all because they are an integral part of the appliance.

5. Exemption for Pump-out Units From 15-pound Limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System-Dependent Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 82.156(c) prohibits the use of system-dependent equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with appliances normally containing more than 15 pounds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerant. This prohibition was intended to cover small, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portable system-dependent equipment, which is not designed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recovery of large quantities of refrigerant. As noted above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, some large chillers are equipped with built-in pump-out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units that could also be considered ``system-dependent equipment,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but that are designed to be used for the recovery of large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantities of refrigerant. EPA did not intend to prohibit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of such pump-out units for recovery. Thus, EPA is revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;82.156(c) to read ``System-dependent equipment shall not be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with appliances normally containing more than 15 pounds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerant, unless the system-dependent equipment is permanently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attached to the appliance as a pump-out unit.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Applicability Solely to Equipment Containing More Than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 Pounds of Refrigerant of Leak Repair and Associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recordkeeping Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 82.156(i), the leak repair requirement, contains two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subparagraphs that apply to owners of different types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. The first subparagraph, &sect;82.156(i)(1), applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``owners of commercial refrigeration and industrial process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration,'' specifying no lower size limit for covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. The second subparagraph, &sect;82.156(i)(2), applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``owners of appliances normally containing more than 50 pounds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerant and not covered by paragraph (i)(1).'' EPA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received numerous inquiries regarding whether or not it intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include a lower size limit in the first subparagraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA did not explicitly restrict the scope of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leak repair requirement for commercial and industrial process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration to equipment containing more than 50 pounds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerant, EPA intended this requirement to cover only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment containing at least 50 pounds. The definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial refrigeration includes a note that ``[a]ll of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment contains large refrigerant charges, typically over 75 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pounds,'' and the discussion of industrial process refrigeration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that appears in the preamble to the rule includes a note that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``charge sizes can be very large, ranging from 750&hyph;3000 lbs for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ice rinks, and rising as high as 20,000 lbs for built-up 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centrifugal units.'' (No other charge sizes are mentioned.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble also notes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 50-pound cut-off is intended to exempt smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment where the cost of repairing the leak is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order of magnitude higher than the environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit of repairing the leak (RIA). The 50-pound cut-off is also consistent with guidance found in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHRAE Guideline 3&hyph;1990 (58 FR 28680). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rationale applies to commercial and industrial process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration as well as to other large appliances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to clarify that only commercial and industrial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process refrigeration equipment containing more than 50 pounds is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by the leak repair requirements, EPA is now specifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this limit in &sect;82.156(i)(1).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Measurement of Recovery Rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 82.158(b)(6) requires manufacturers of recycling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery equipment to have an approved equipment testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organization measure the liquid and vapor recovery rates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment as part of the equipment certification process. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required measurement and publication of these recovery rates in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to ensure that technicians would not inadvertently purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment whose recovery rates were too low for the intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application; the Agency was concerned that a technician 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasing underpowered equipment would be tempted to interrupt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the resulting lengthy recovery process before it was complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, some types of equipment do not have inherent liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and vapor recovery rates. For instance, the recovery rate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system-dependent equipment depends upon the compressor of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual appliance from which it is recovering refrigerant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intended to exempt this equipment from the requirement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have its liquid and vapor recovery rate measured. First, system-dependent equipment certified pursuant to &sect;82.158(b)
typically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has a higher recovery rate than self-contained equipment, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appliance compressors are usually larger and therefore faster 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than recovery equipment compressors. Second, the use of system- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent equipment is limited to appliances normally containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 15 pounds of refrigerant. Thus, low recovery rates are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a concern for such equipment. EPA is therefore amending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 82.158(b)(6) of the rule to clarify that equipment with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no inherent liquid or vapor recovery rates need not have these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates measured.

Additional revisions to &sect;82.161 have been proposed by EPA. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 published 8&hyph;15&hyph;94) These proposed changes will more clearly delineate who is required to be certified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 82.161(a) requires that technicians be certified. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempted from this requirement technicians that are disposing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small appliances, room air conditioners, and MVACs because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technicians are only recovering the refrigerant prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of this equipment. As discussed earlier, persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposing of this equipment were exempt from the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the nature of this work is straight-forward. As outlined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, EPA is extending this exemption to MVAC-like appliances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout the rule, EPA states that since MVAC appliances and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MVAC-like appliances are similar in nature and design, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for these technicians to be treated in a similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fashion. In &sect;82.161(a)(5), EPA provides a method for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicing MVAC-like appliances to be certified by attending a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program designed and approved under section 609 for training and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifying MVAC technicians. Therefore, to maintain consistency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as discussed in Section A of this rulemaking, EPA will extend the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption from the certification requirement to technicians that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are disposing of MVAC-like appliances. In addition, since ``room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air conditioners'' are considered a type of small appliance, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small appliances are already excepted from the certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement, EPA will delete ``room air conditioners'' from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list of exceptions.

F. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Sales Restriction_Effective Date for Recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 82.166(a) establishes a recordkeeping requirement for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons who sell or distribute any class I or class II substance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for use as a refrigerant. Since no effective date was specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this particular requirement, this provision became effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 14, 1993, the effective date of the Refrigerant Recycling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations. However, the restriction on selling or distributing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ozone-depleting refrigerants is not effective until November 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14, 1994, pursuant to &sect;82.154(n). EPA does not believe it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to maintain records regarding the sale and distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of refrigerant in advance of the effective date of the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sales or distribution restriction. Furthermore, such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement places an unnecessary burden on industry. Without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existence of a sales restriction, the usefulness of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records is dubious. Therefore, through this action EPA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change the effective date for maintaining records regarding sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and distribution of refrigerants from June 14, 1993 to November 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Proof of Employment of Certified Personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 82.166(b) allows the purchasers of any class I or class II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerants who employ certified technicians to provide evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of each technician's certification to the wholesaler who sells 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them refrigerant. The wholesaler will keep this information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file. The purchaser is further required to notify the wholesaler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding any changes in a technician's certification or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment status. Concerns have recently been brought to EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attention about the practicability of implementing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision. Large organizations often employ large numbers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified technicians that may be situated at various locations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
around the country. Tracking and notifying wholesalers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee status may result in an overwhelming responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA did not intend this requirement to place any undue burden on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employers of large numbers of technicians. In fact, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that allowing employers to purchase refrigerant for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their technicians, instead of requiring the technician to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physically present at the point of sale, would actually decrease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the burden for the technician, the wholesaler, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technician's employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA is modifying this requirement to read: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Purchasers of any class I or class II refrigerants who employ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified technicians may provide evidence that at least one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technician is properly certified to the wholesaler who sells them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerant; the wholesaler will then keep this information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file and may sell refrigerant to the purchaser or his authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative even if such purchaser or authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative is not a properly certified technician. In such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, the purchaser must notify the wholesaler in the event that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purchaser no longer employs at least one properly certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technician. The wholesaler is then prohibited from selling class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I or class II refrigerants to the purchaser until such time as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purchaser employs at least one properly certified technician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At that time, the purchaser must provide new evidence that at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least one technician is properly certified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that this requirement will still have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended effect of lessening the likelihood that refrigerant is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sold for use by non-certified personnel, while providing a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable means for purchasers to comply with the sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restriction.

G. Appendix A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA adopted an industry standard in the final rule based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Air-conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI) Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
700&hyph;1988. This standard appeared as Appendix A to Subpart F_Specification for Fluorocarbon Refrigerants.
EPA was aware of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts to revise ARI 700&hyph;1988 while the final regulations were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being drafted. However, the revised version was not completed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time for incorporation into this appendix by EPA. As discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the updated version, known as ARI 700&hyph;1993, includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in three areas: it adds purity standards for eleven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional refrigerants; it increases liquid phase contaminant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water levels from 10ppm in ARI 700&hyph;1988 to 20ppm in ARI 700&hyph;1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for R&hyph;11 and R&hyph;113 only; and, where ARI 700&hyph;1988 allowed 0.5 as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum percentage by weight of ``other refrigerants,'' ARI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
700&hyph;1993 allows 0.50 as the maximum percentage by weight of ``all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other organic impurities, including other refrigerants.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion of all organic impurities in the limit effectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tightens the standard, and the change from 0.5 to 0.50 reduces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tolerance of the standard by a factor of ten. EPA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed ARI 700&hyph;1993 and believes it should be substituted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it covers additional refrigerants, it increases liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase contaminant water levels, and broadens the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of weight requirement to include all other organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impurities instead of just other refrigerants. Through this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action EPA will substitute the standard based on ARI Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
700&hyph;1988 with a standard based on ARI Standard 700&hyph;1993.

Appendix B to Subpart F_Performance of Refrigerant Recovery, Recycling and/or Reclaim Equipment was mistakenly
referred to in the introduction of appendix B as ARI Standard 740&hyph;1991. However, this is incorrect. Appendix
B is based upon ARI Standard 740&hyph;1993. Through this action EPA will correct the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference in the introduction to appendix B.

Appendix D to subpart F_Standards for Becoming a Certifying Program for Technicians includes reporting requirements
for approved programs. Certifying programs are required to submit to EPA activity reports every six months, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first to be submitted six months following the date the program was approved. Since EPA has been approving programs
on a continual basis, these reports are due at various times, instead of being submitted simultaneously. In order
to maximize EPA's ability to review and respond to the information supplied by the programs, EPA is standardizing
the reporting dates. Certifying programs will submit reports to EPA on January 30 and June 30, beginning with the first
full six-month period for which the program has been approved. This means that if a program is approved on March 31,
that program is required to submit its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first activity report to EPA on the following January 30.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is deleting the parenthetical notes in the individual sections of 40 CFR part 82, subpart F. The Agency consolidated
its display of OMB control numbers in 40 CFR part 9 (see 58 FR 18014, 58 FR 24724, 58 FR 34198 and 58 FR 34369) including
the control number for 40 CFR part 82, subpart F; this consolidated display makes the parenthetical statements in
the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections of Subpart F duplicative. The information collection request (ICR) was previously subject to public notice
and comment prior to OMB approval.

This final action will become effective on October 18, 1994 unless EPA is notified by September 19, 1994 that any person
wishes to submit adverse comment. Should EPA receive such notice, EPA will publish one subsequent action in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to withdraw this final action and another action proposing this action and requesting comments. In such a case, following
a public comment period, the Agency will draft the final regulation to be published in the

IV. Summary of Supporting Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether this regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affect a sector of the economy,
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined by OMB and EPA that this amendment to the final rule is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review under the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;602, requires that Federal agencies examine the impacts of their
regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of
proposed rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis
(RFA). Such an analysis is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that any impact that this amendment will have on the regulated community will serve only to provide relief
from otherwise applicable regulations, and will therefore limit the negative economic impact associated with the
regulations previously promulgated under Section 608. An examination of the impacts on small entities was discussed
in the final rule (58 FR 28660). That final rule assessed the impact the rule may have on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities. A separate regulatory impact analysis accompanied the final rule and is contained in Docket A&hyph;92&hyph;01.
I certify that this amendment to the refrigerant recycling rule will not have any additional negative economic impacts
on any small entities.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any information collection requirements in a rule must be submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because no additional informational collection requirements are required by this amendment, EPA has determined
that the Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to this rulemaking and no new Information Collection Request document
has been prepared.

V. Judicial Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because these regulations are nationally applicable under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, judicial review of this
action is available only by the filing of a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit within sixty days of publication of this action in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Special precautions should be taken

to assure that representative samples are obtained for analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sampling shall be done by trained laboratory personnel following

Gas Phase Sample. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A gas phase sample shall be obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for determining the non-condensables. Since non-condensable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gases, if present, will concentrate in the vapor phase of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerant, care must be exercised to eliminate introduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air during the sample transfer. Purging is not an acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure for a gas phase sample since it may introduce a foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. Since R11, R113 and R123 have normal boiling points at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or above room temperature, non-condensable determination is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for these refrigerants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an evacuated gas sampling cylinder by means of a manifold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manifold should have a valve arrangement that facilitates

After the manifold has been evacuated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close the valve to the pump and open the valve on the system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take the sample as a liquid by chilling the sample cylinder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slightly. Accurate analysis requires that the sample container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be filled to at least 60% by volume, however under no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances should the cylinder be filled to more than 80% by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume. This can be accomplished by weighing the empty cylinder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and then the cylinder with refrigerant. When the desired amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of refrigerant has been collected, close the valve(s) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disconnect the sample cylinder immediately.

Method. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coulometric Karl Fischer Titration shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the primary test method for determining the water content of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerants. This method is described in Appendix-93 to ARI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard 700. This method can be used for refrigerants that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either a liquid or a gas at room temperature, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerants 11 and 113, and 123. For all refrigerants, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample for water analysis shall be taken from the liquid phase of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the container to be tested. Proper operation of the analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method requires special equipment and an experienced operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The precision of the results is excellent if proper sampling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling procedures are followed. Refrigerants containing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colored dye can be successfully analyzed for water using this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method.

Certifying programs must maintain records for at least three years which include, but are not limited to, the names
and addresses of all individuals taking the tests, the scores of all certification tests administered, and the dates
and locations of all testing administered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA must receive an activity report from all approved certifying programs by every January 30 and June 30, the first
to be submitted following the first full six-month period for which the program has been approved by EPA. This report
will include the pass/fail rate and testing schedules. This will allow the Agency to determine the relative progress
and success of these programs. If the certifying program believes a test bank question needs to be modified, information
about that question should also be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approved certifying programs will receive a letter of approval from EPA. Each testing center must display a copy of
that letter.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Coast Guard is requiring escort vessels for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain oil tankers transiting Prince William Sound, Alaska, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Puget Sound, Washington. This rulemaking is mandated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). The regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will reduce the chances of a tanker running aground or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colliding as a result of loss of propulsion or steering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, thereby potentially reducing the risk of an oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spill.

Regulatory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 7, 1992, the Coast Guard published a notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled ``Escort Vessels for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain Oil Tankers'' in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 30058). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the Coast Guard received comments to the NPRM which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not as extensive as expected, it reopened the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period (58 FR 16391, March 26, 1993) to solicit more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific comments on certain issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard also published an advance notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) (58 FR 25766, April 27, 1993) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeking comment on other U.S. waters where an escort should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be required, and other vessels that should also be escorted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That regulatory project (CGD 91&hyph;202a) is ongoing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to many comments, public hearings were held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Anchorage, Alaska on June 3, 1993, Valdez, Alaska on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 5, 1993 and Seattle, Washington on June 7, 1993 (58 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25959, April 29, 1993; and 58 FR 29157, May 19, 1993). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alaska hearings were also teleconferenced to include several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outlying communities in the Exxon Valdez impact area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transcripts of those hearings have been placed in the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dockets for these rulemakings (CGD 91&hyph;202 and CGD 91&hyph;202a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are available for inspection or copying at room 3406, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, the Prince William Sound Disabled Tanker 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Towing Study (DTTS) Group is sponsoring a special study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the present tanker escort operations in Prince 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
William Sound (PWS). The study group is made up of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives from five regional interest groups: the PWS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tanker Association, the PWS Regional Citizens' Advisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council, Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, the Alaska 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Environmental Conservation, and the Coast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guard. Although the DTTS is a separate project from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking, it is of particular value to this rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the technical information it will develop on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maneuvering characteristics of disabled tankers under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of different combinations of escort vessels. Part 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the DTTS, entitled ``Evaluation of Existing Equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Personnel and Procedures,'' has been completed and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the public through the National Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Service (NTIS). The Coast Guard published a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of availability (NOA) (59 FR 1411; January 10, 1994) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Part 1. The NOA reprinted the Executive Summary from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 1, and provided information for ordering copies of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study from NTIS. Part 2 of the study is expected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed in spring 1994; the Coast Guard will publish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another NOA when details are available.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380) requires the Secretary of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transportation to initiate rulemaking to define areas where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single-hulled tankers over 5,000 gross tons (GT) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transporting oil in bulk must be escorted by at least two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``towing vessels'' (as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101) or by some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other vessels which the Secretary considers appropriate. By 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute, these defined areas must include Prince William 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sound, Alaska, and Rosario Strait and Puget Sound, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington (including those portions of the Strait of Juan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
de Fuca east of Port Angeles, Haro Strait, and the Strait of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Georgia subject to United States jurisdiction). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary also has the authority to extend the escort rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to other U.S. waters as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rulemaking authority has been delegated to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coast Guard, which will implement section 4116(c) in two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate rulemaking projects: CGD 91&hyph;202 addresses escort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the Prince William Sound and Puget Sound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters named in the statute, and CGD 91&hyph;202a addresses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escort requirements for other waters.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Role of escort vessels.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four comments suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the guidelines concerning the role of the escort must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be clearly specified and defined. One comment stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the principal purpose of the escort should be to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanker accidents by steering or retarding disabled tankers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that an escort should be able to safely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist a tanker moving near its maneuvering speed, alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanker's speed or course, apply lateral force, and overtake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tanker within confined waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard generally agrees with these comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The role of the escort vessels is to assist a tanker that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiencing a loss of propulsion or steering control and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore at risk of collision or grounding. However, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be pointed out that escort vessels may not always be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to prevent all tanker accidents. This rule requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that reasonably capable escort vessels be immediately on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand to assist a tanker as circumstances permit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision to respond, however, must be left to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional judgement of the escort vessel's master, who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must always first consider the risk to the escort vessel and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its crew. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Benefit of escort vessels.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four comments stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they did not believe that the presence of escort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels improves the safety of the transit; two comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further stated that safety is actually reduced because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased vessel traffic (due to the escort vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
themselves) which increases opportunities for collisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, another comment asserted that tug escorts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would increase the risk of collision in Puget Sound. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, one comment points out that there are significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety benefits gained by providing escorts for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although escort vessels may not always be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent a tanker accident, the Coast Guard believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escort vessels can successfully control a tanker under many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. Having reasonably capable escort vessels on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand, coupled with the tanker master's duty to operate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanker within the performance capabilities of the escort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels, will provide the maximum feasible assurance that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the transit can be safely made. The Coast Guard disagrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that vessel traffic would be substantially increased: in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prince William Sound the increased traffic would be two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escort vessels once every two months; in Puget Sound the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased traffic would average four escort vessels per day, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is not a significant increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thirteen comments related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various definitions proposed in the NPRM, or proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional definitions. Accordingly, &sect;168.5 of this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adds, revises, and deletes certain terms that were proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Definitions of ``disabled tanker'' and ``escort transit'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been added.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``escort vessel'' has been revised in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to reflect the fact that a variety of vessel types can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform escort services other than just the ``towing vessels'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited in the statute. Furthermore, a vessel that may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable for escorting a particular tanker under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transit conditions may not be suitable for escorting other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tankers, or even the same tanker under other conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The necessary elements of an escort vessel are that: it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dedicated exclusively to the tanker for the duration of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transit; and it is properly equipped for its intended role 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an emergency response (pushing, towing, etc.). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second element means that it is not necessary for the escort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels to have duplicative capabilities. For example, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escorting vessel does not have to be outfitted with towing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gear if another escorting vessel is adequately outfitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``laden'' replaces the NPRM's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``transporting oil in bulk'' because it is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``single hull tanker'' has been added, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although it still maintains the same vessel applicability as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the NPRM: any tanker that is not double-hulled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Definitions of ``tanker owner or operator'' and ``tanker 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
master'' have been added. They distinguish a shoreside owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or management organization (that has overall operational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of the tanker), including a demise (bareboat) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charterer, from a tanker's master (who is the licensed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onboard person in charge of the tanker). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM's definition of ``static bollard pull'' has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deleted because it is not used in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM originally made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanker master responsible for selecting the escort vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six comments were received on this issue, and all of them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally expressed the opinion that the tanker master 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be responsible for selecting or deciding escort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel suitability. Some comments argued that the tanker 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
master may not be sufficiently familiar with the local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters, weather conditions or other navigational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations to select the best escort vessels; these are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some of the reasons why pilots are embarked when any vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enters a port. Some comments also argued that escort vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selections might be made by the tanker's shoreside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management company, putting the tanker master under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerable pressure to accept whatever vessels have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispatched. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard generally agrees that proper selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of escort vessels requires some specialized knowledge and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-planning which might be beyond the abilities of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanker master to accomplish. Such knowledge might have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be developed from tanker-specific maneuvering and control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies. Also, tanker owners or operators may wish to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractual arrangements with escort vessel operators to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure appropriate vessels are available at favorable rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the resources to conduct studies or make contractual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements are controlled by the tanker's owners or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators (shoreside management), it is more appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they should be ultimately responsible for the escort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel selection and providing the tanker master with any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specialized information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, &sect;168.10 makes the tanker owners or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators responsible for escort vessel selection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informing the tanker master of the performance capabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the escort vessels. The master is responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating the tanker within those performance capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations do not preclude owners or operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from authorizing masters or other agents to make selections, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although the tanker owners or operators will have to furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the necessary technical information for proper escort vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
5. Applicable vessels.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OPA 90 specifically targets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single hull tank ships of more than 5,000 gross tons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(GT) (5,000 GT corresponds to approximately 10,000 deadweight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tons (DWT), which is the tonnage measurement more commonly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to tankers). The NPRM proposed to include tankers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with only double bottoms or double sides but exclude double 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hulled tankers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight comments to the NPRM addressed the issue of hull 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design (i.e. single hull, double hull, double bottom, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
double sides). Most of these comments stated that double 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hulls should not be excluded from the escort requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments did agree with the double hull exclusion, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another comment also agreed with the double hull exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and stated that double bottom tankers should also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded. One comment suggested that the escort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements should apply to all tankers over 5,000 GT, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(regardless of construction) and another comment suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they should apply to all vessels carrying oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(regardless of construction or size). One comment suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that all single-hulled oil tankers should be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether laden or unladen. The Coast Guard is of the opinion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Congress did not intend for tankers that meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPA 90 double hull design requirements to be escorted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the originally-proposed hull design standard has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not been revised: double hull tankers are excluded, but all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other single hull, double bottom, and double side tankers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eleven comments addressed size limits for applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tankers, suggesting either to raise the gross tonnage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold (thereby excluding some tankers greater than 5,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GT) or require escorts for only those tankers carrying more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than a particular quantity of oil. One comment pointed out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that smaller tankers are less of a threat to the environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than larger ones, and therefore should not have to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escorted. Two of the comments support the proposed size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. OPA 90 specifically includes tankers down to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,000 GT; therefore, the proposed size limit has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four comments were received which advocated excluding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those tankers with twin screw propulsion systems, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounds that a simultaneous failure of both propulsion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems was unlikely. OPA 90 requires tankers that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
double-hulled to be escorted, regardless of propulsion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, &sect;168.20 makes the regulations applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all U.S. and foreign-flag single hull tankers of more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,000 GT, including tankers with only double bottoms or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
double sides, or double hull tankers that do not meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dimensional standards of 33 CFR 157.10d (which are the OPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
90 double hull standards). The regulations do not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tankers less than 5,000 GT or tank barges of any size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
6. Applicable cargoes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM proposed to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``oil'' cargoes, without distinguishing between petroleum and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-petroleum (i.e., animal or vegetable) oils. Six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments indicated that tankers carrying animal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vegetable oils should be excluded from the escort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. One comment went on to say that if these oils 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are included, then the ruling would have a detrimental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on his small business. The issue of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring escorts for tankers carrying only animal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vegetable oils, and other non-petroleum oils, warrants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further consideration. This will be addressed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ongoing rulemaking (CGD 91&hyph;202a) which concerns other U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters where an escort may be required and other criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for defining the vessels that should be escorted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, &sect;168.30 of this rule applies only to petroleum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oils (MARPOL Annex I), which are listed in 46 CFR Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30.25&hyph;1 as pollution category I cargoes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four comments noted that many hazardous chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cargoes can pose serious risks to the marine environment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health, and argued that vessels carrying these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cargoes should also be escorted. One comment stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional regulations are needed to cover the transfer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous substances not covered by the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The Coast Guard has determined that including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous material cargoes is outside the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority of OPA 90. However, the Coast Guard will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeking further comment on this issue as part of the ``other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters'' escort vessel rulemaking and may propose regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include certain hazardous material and or NLS cargoes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under authority of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(33 U.S.C. 1221 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
7. Applicable waters. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty comments addressed what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. waters should be included under the escort regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Prince William Sound, 12 comments stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escorts should be continuously required all the way from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Port Valdez to Hinchinbrook Entrance (including the mid-Sound region). Four comments stated that escorts should

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only be required at Port Valdez and Hinchinbrook Entrance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not in mid-Sound because there is enough sea room in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mid-Sound for a tanker to safely drift while waiting for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrival of assist tugs dispatched from Port Valdez. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coast Guard agrees that escorts are appropriate for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regions of Prince William Sound, and the rule so provides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Puget Sound escort zone, the NPRM proposed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
western boundary of longitude 123
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;24.5
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; West, but excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tankers transiting to and from the Ediz Hook anchorage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Port Angeles (which would require them to skirt just inside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that boundary). Three comments suggested moving the western 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary of the escort zone to the entrance to the Straits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Juan de Fuca (Cape Flattery), while 2 comments suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moving the western boundary eastwards to coincide with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing escort zone established by Washington state. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment suggested the applicable area be extended to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ediz Hook anchorage adjacent to the Port Angeles Harbor. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a result of comments, this rule revises the western boundary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by shifting it approximately 11 nautical miles eastwards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the U.S. waters east of the line connecting New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dungeness Light (Washington) with Discovery Island Light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Canada). This new boundary location therefore coincides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the existing Federal boundary line governing maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanker size in Puget Sound waters (33 CFR 161.143), as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the boundary line for escorting as required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing Washington state regulations. This change still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excludes the Ediz Hook anchorage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining comments nominated additional waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
besides Prince William Sound and Puget Sound, such as Cook 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inlet, Alaska, and the Olympic coast, Washington. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments will be considered in the separate ``other waters'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking project (CGD 91&hyph;202a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
8. Number of escort vessels. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Coast Guard define the required capabilities of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escort vessel rather than only specifying any particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of escort vessels. Another comment supported the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for two escorts in Prince William Sound. Two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments suggested that smaller tankers be allowed to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only one escort vessel. Two comments disagreed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring the usage of two escort vessels and suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one would be adequate in most cases. OPA 90 requires a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum of two escort vessels for the Prince William Sound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Puget Sound waters stipulated in the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, regulations for those waters which cite OPA 90 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority must incorporate this statutory minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
9. Relative positioning of escort vessels. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other provisions, the NPRM proposed that the escort vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be ``available in close proximity to the tanker at all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times.'' Twelve comments addressed the issue of where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escort vessels should be positioned (relative to the tanker) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the escort transit. In lieu of a close proximity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement, some comments suggested a specified maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distance from the tanker, such as one-half mile. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other comments argued that a specified distance was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessarily restrictive. The latter comments pointed out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the closer any vessel is to a tanker, the greater the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of a collision. These comments argued that, in open 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters, the escort vessel should have the flexibility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position itself at any safe distance as judged by its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
master, so long as it could still respond in a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fashion. The Coast Guard agrees with the ``timely response'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach, and has revised this rule accordingly. This will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively require the tanker and escort vessel masters to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuously evaluate the situation and reposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
themselves, as appropriate, at different points along the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transit route. This does not preclude the escort vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from remaining in the shelter of the tanker's lee if weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions and prudent seamanship warrant; the tanker should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then adjust its speed to compensate for any delays before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the escort vessels could move into position to render 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance in an emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
10. Performance requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the escort vessels be ``capable of providing sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maneuvering forces to substantially influence the speed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direction of travel of the tanker.'' Twelve comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed the issue of performance capabilities of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escort vessels. One comment recommended that a tug escort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the capability to push or tow a disabled ship away from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the danger of grounding or collision. One comment suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that tug escorts should have the ability to stop a disabled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel within 10 vessel lengths from the declaration of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency (this comment qualified its suggestion by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizing that such a standard would be very dependent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the harbor conditions). Another comment suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tug escorts be capable of meeting the demands of assisting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the escorted tanker. Another comment contended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance and design criteria for tug escorts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dictated by an effective escort program, and suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local geography, local man-made hazards, and regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel speeds be considered when developing tug escort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capabilities criteria. Four comments addressed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance standards as outlined in the NPRM. One comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that performance standards should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographically-specific. Two comments recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance based criteria be coupled with the tanker's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tonnage, weather, or sea conditions. Additionally, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment was specifically concerned with weather conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and suggested that oil tankers only be allowed to operate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prince William Sound when weather conditions would permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe operation of the tug escorts. This comment further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that the realistic adverse weather limits for safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escorting operations is approximately 40-knot wind speed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10-foot seas. Another comment generally supported the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance-based criteria as proposed in the NPRM, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that operating parameters also be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard agrees that performance requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be more detailed. Accordingly, &sect;168.50 of this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been revised to include towing, stopping, holding, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turning requirements for controlling a tanker within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified parameters under various failure and weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenarios, and to require that the tanker not be operated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond a speed at which the escort vessels can reasonably be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to bring it safely under control within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
navigational limits of the waterway. The requirements were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed after reviewing several tanker/tug maneuvering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies that were submitted to the docket, and considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the largest tankers in Prince William Sound are about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
265,000 DWT (deadweight tons) and the largest in the Puget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sound waters are 125,000 DWT.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The underlying basis of the performance requirements is to: (1) Ensure sufficient power to perform a rescue tow of
a tanker (or to substantially reduce its drift rate in severe winds); and (2) provide steering and stopping forces
that are equivalent to what the tanker could do itself (with its own steering and propulsion system) at a speed of 6 knots.
The Coast Guard believes that, in conjunction with an appropriate tanker speed during the transit, both conventional
tugs and tractor tugs that meet the performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements can reasonably be expected to safely accomplish effective emergency control of disabled tankers.
Discussion of the specific performance requirements is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Towing:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations require an escort vessel to be capable of towing the tanker at 4 knots in calm conditions and hold it
in a steady position against a 45-knot headwind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Stopping:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations require that the escort vessel(s) be able to stop the tanker within the same distance that the tanker
would have been able to crash-stop itself from a speed of 6 knots using its own propulsion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Holding on steady course:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations require that the escort vessel(s) be able to hold the tanker on a steady course against a 35-degree
locked rudder at 6 knots. This means that the escort vessels must be able to apply a counteractive turning moment equal
and opposite to the turning moment generated by the locked rudder, taking into consideration the geometry of the escort
vessel's applied force on the tanker's hull (points of application, angle of assist, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Turning:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations require that the escort vessel(s) be able to turn the tanker 90 degrees, assuming a free-swinging
rudder and an initial speed of 6 knots, in the same distance (advance and transfer) as it would have been able to turn
itself using a hard-over rudder. The geometry of the escort vessels' applied forces on the tanker must similarly be
taken into consideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These requirements are based upon the 6-knot maneuvering characteristics of the tanker because this is the upper
speed limit at which conventional tugs can safely make connections to the tanker. However, the Coast Guard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that not all steering or propulsion failures will require immediate intervention by the escort vessels.
In many instances, there could be enough sea room in the waterway for the tanker to safely drift to a stop without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance from escort vessels. The regulations, therefore, allow a tanker to transit at any speed provided that
there is sufficient sea room to accommodate the disabled tanker's travel (advance and transfer) until it has naturally
slowed down to the speed where the escort vessels can move in and bring it under control. For example, a tanker can make
a transit at 10 knots if there is adequate sea room on both sides of its trackline to tolerate a locked rudder at that speed.
In a constrained waterway, however, or in adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weather conditions, prudent seamanship may require the tanker to reduce its transit speed, or expand the performance
capabilities of its escort vessels (such as by adding another escort vessel, pre-tethering, etc.), or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
11. Other operational requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment concerning other operational requirements suggested that escort vessels be required to be pre-tethered
to a tanker before entering especially constrained waterways (the hazard presented by Middle Rock in Valdez Narrows
was specifically mentioned as an example). Although the Coast Guard agrees that, under certain conditions, pre-tethering
may be appropriate, it may not be necessary under other circumstances. Pre-tethering may entail a safety risk to the
escort vessel and its crew; it should be viewed as an option that the tanker and escort vessel masters may utilize after
discussing the sea and weather conditions at the anticipated time of transit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six comments on other operational requirements urged that specific speed limits be set as part of the regulations;
however, three comments disagreed. The Coast Guard also does not agree that specific speed limits are necessary because
&sect;168.50(a)(3) requires that a tanker not be operated beyond a speed at which the escort vessels can reasonably
be expected to safely bring the tanker under control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
12. Escort plans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM proposed that escort vessel operators prepare written information on the capabilities of their vessels
and submit the information to the local Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) for review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and approval. The approved information would then be used by the tanker master to select escort vessels during the
pre-escort conference. Ten comments recommended requiring tanker-specific escort plans rather than escort vessel-specific
plans (on the argument that the appropriate approach to escort vessel selection must be based on the needs of the tanker
rather than the abilities of the escort vessels). Two comments suggested alternatives to selecting the escort vessels
at the pre-escort conference: one comment recommended that the Coast Guard COTP be responsible for prior approval
and designation, and the other comment recommended that each affected port establish a clearinghouse for certified
escort vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the regulations contain specific performance criteria, and because the responsibility for selecting appropriate
escort vessels is on the tanker owners or operators, the Coast Guard has reconsidered its originally proposed requirement
for submittal and approval of written escort plans, and decided that there is no longer any need. Tanker and escort
vessel owners or operators can work together to match tanker needs with escort vessel capabilities without Coast
Guard participation. Tanker owners or operators can make arrangements for appropriate escort vessels in advance
of the tanker's arrival, and retain the flexibility of making those arrangements in several ways, such as pre-contracting,
establishing local clearinghouses of escort vessels, etc. Therefore, the NPRM's original requirement for submittal
of written escort plans has been deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
13. Pre-escort conference.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NPRM originally had two purposes for the pre-escort conference: (1) for the tanker master to determine the suitability
of the escort vessels (on the basis of written information submitted at the conference); and (2) a joint conference
for the tanker 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
master, pilot and escort vessel masters to discuss and plan the escort transit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight comments were received concerning the pre-escort conference. In general, the comments agreed that it could
be used for exchanging safety and tactical information between the tanker master, pilot, and escort vessel masters.
One comment noted that the current briefing practice in Washington state is sufficient. However, four comments pointed
out that the conference, as proposed, would occur too late to actually select the escort vessels. Rejection of an escort
vessel at that point could lead to tanker delays and congestion while waiting for a replacement escort. They argued
that dispatching several escort vessels to meet a tanker, of which only two or three would be selected, would waste
the time and expense of the non-selected vessels. Two comments were concerned that lengthy pre-escort conferences
would similarly cause delays and congestion. Further, one of the comments indicated that this would cause undesirable
economic pressure for the vessel master and pilot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard recognizes that the pre-escort conference may be too late for selecting or rejecting the escort vessels.
As previously discussed in paragraph (4), escort vessel selection is now the responsibility of the tanker owner or
operators. This will allow them to make arrangements for appropriate escort vessels in advance of the tanker's arrival
(or departure, if outbound). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 168.10 has been revised to reflect the changed responsibilities for selecting escort vessels and to state
more clearly the purpose of the conference and the topics to be discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
14. Additional mission requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Fourteen comments addressed additional mission requirements for the escort vessels, nominating firefighting,
salvage, lightering, and pollution response capabilities (the spill response capability of the Alyeska Pipeline
Service Company's Ship Escort and Response Vessel System (SERVS) vessels in escort service in Prince William Sound
were specifically mentioned). One comment stated that spill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment and firefighting are excessive secondary functions that the escort should not be expected to perform.
The Coast Guard has determined that none of these capabilities can be easily retrofitted aboard the existing fleet
of tugs, which will make up the bulk of the escort vessel resources. This is because most tugs do not have sufficient
deck area to accommodate the additional mission equipment, nor sufficient above-water height (and associated stability)
to serve as effective firefighting platforms. However, the regulations do not preclude using vessels with such capabilities
if they are available.

15. Coordination with vessel response plans (VRPs).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Five comments suggested coordination of the escort regulations with the special vessel response plan (VRP) requirements
for tank vessels operating in Prince William 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sound, as required by section 5005 of OPA 90 and the Interim Final Rule for vessel response plans (58 FR 7376, February
5, 1993). One of these special VRP requirements is to provide ``escort vessels with skimming capability.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern of the comments is that there will be two Federal definitions of ``escort vessel:'' one definition in the VRP
regulations (which would include skimming requirements), and the other definition in the escort vessel regulations
(without any skimming requirements). This could lead to confusion or unnecessary expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard agrees that there should be a single, consistent definition of ``escort vessel'' throughout all the
OPA 90 rulemakings. The intent of the special VRP requirement is for a vessel with skimming (response) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability to accompany a laden tanker across Prince William Sound. The Coast Guard has determined that this is a spill
response capability that is separate from the emergency control measures that the escort vessels are intended to
provide under this rulemaking. Accordingly, the final rule for the VRP rulemaking will be revised by eliminating
the term ``escort vessel'' and substituting in its place the term ``escorting response vessel.'' As previously noted,
this does not preclude a single, appropriately-equipped vessel from fulfilling both requirements (escorting and
skimming) in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prince William Sound. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
16. Prince William Sound Disabled Tanker Towing Study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nine comments were received suggesting that the escort regulations should be postponed until completion of the Prince
William Sound Disabled Tanker Towing Study (DTTS), in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to benefit from the findings of that study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time the Coast Guard has reviewed Part 1 of the DTTS, as well as several other technical studies concerning escorting
and control of disabled tankers, and expects that the regulations will be supported by the final DTTS results. Therefore,
the Coast Guard believes that it can now move ahead with this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
17. Discussion of other comments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two comments suggested that the Vessel Traffic Systems (VTS) be expanded instead of requiring escort vessels. One
comment, however, disagreed with the usage of the VTS system, saying that such a system failed in the EXXON VALDEZ disaster;
this comment suggested using another emergency towing arrangement. Two comments recommended that VTS control be
employed for small tallow tankers. Further, one of these comments suggested that when such employment is not feasible,
a single escort should be used. The Coast Guard does not agree that a VTS can substitute for the immediate, on-site assistance
that an escort vessel can provide. It should be noted that the VTS and escort vessel requirements of OPA 90 are separate,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of one does not obviate the need for the other. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment recommended that the Coast Guard should ensure construction of double hull U.S. flag vessels which have
a redundant propulsion system. The Coast Guard has determined that this is beyond the scope of the escort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel rulemaking.

Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of substantial public interest, this rule is a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive
Order 12866 and has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It requires an assessment
of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It is significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under

Summary of Final Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain oil tankers transiting through both Prince William Sound and Puget Sound are already subject to state-level
escort requirements. The final Assessment for this rulemaking evaluates the economic impact of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal regulations by analyzing the incremental cost increases beyond the costs already incurred due to the state
regulations. In Prince William Sound, the crude oil tankers operating out of Port Valdez are already escorted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company contingency plan which was approved by the State of Alaska.
Therefore, there is not much incremental impact from the Federal regulations: only approximately six tankers per
year deliver refined products to the Navy fuel depot at Whittier (these tankers are not required to be escorted under
Alaska regulations). In Puget Sound, an estimated 1,256 tanker transits per year are affected: approximately 879
transits where one escort vessel is already engaged (under Washington state regulations) will now require at least
one additional escort vessel to meet the Federal regulations. Also, because the Federal regulations encompass tankers
down to 5,000 GT (approximately 10,000 DWT), an estimated 377 additional tanker transits per year will now require
at least two escort vessels (these tankers presently do not require any escorts because the Washington state regulations
only extend down to 40,000 DWT). Therefore, the regulations are estimated to initially increase vessel traffic by
12 escort vessel transits per year in Prince William Sound and 1,633 escort vessel transits per year in Puget Sound.
However, these numbers will decline as single hull tankers are phased out of service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OPA 90 phase-out schedule requires single hull tankers to be removed from service by 2010, but allows certain tankers
with double sides or double bottoms to remain in service until 2015. Because it was not possible to project how many
tankers of each design (single-hulled, double-bottomed, or double-sided) will be in service over the next 20 years,
the Assessment assumes that all tankers subject to this rulemaking are single-hulled (i.e., will be removed from
service by 2010). Therefore, the incremental escort vessel cost to the oil tanker industry will decrease to zero by
that year. The Assessment conservatively assumes the same phase out schedule as used for the Regulatory Evaluation
of the double hull rulemaking, although tanker owners or operators in these waters may choose to replace their single
hull tankers at an earlier time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of comments to the NPRM, the regulations have been revised in certain respects. These revisions also affect
some of the economic assumptions and calculations in the original preliminary Regulatory Evaluation. Accordingly,
the final Assessment has been revised as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Certain costs have been recalculated, using new cost data for escort vessel services. The Assessment assumes
the average cost of an escort vessel is $1,350 per hour; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) New costs have been added, recognizing that tanker owners or operators may have to conduct various sea trials and
computer simulation studies (in order to determine the maneuvering and control characteristics of their tankers).
Even though this information is not directly required by regulation, it is still an indirect cost that will be borne
by industry; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The benefit analysis has been significantly revised (discussed later); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Costs and benefits have been recalculated at a 7 percent discount rate, in order to be consistent with current OMB
directives and other OPA 90 regulatory assessments (the original preliminary Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discounted all costs at 10 percent).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Prince William Sound, the Assessment estimates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the incremental escort cost is $94,500 per tanker transit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Hinchinbrook Entrance to Whittier (via Bligh Reef pilot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
station) and return, using two escort vessels dispatched 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Port Valdez. This cost-per-transit is relatively high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the tanker must pay for the total round-trip 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispatch time of the escort vessels. Because these tankers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are operated or chartered by the Navy, the escort costs will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultimately be borne by the U.S. Government (Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defense). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Puget Sound, the Assessment assumes that there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient inbound or outbound tanker traffic such that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanker will only be paying for one-way dispatch time of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escort vessels. However, unlike Prince William Sound, there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are several possible destination terminals in Puget Sound; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly, escorted transit times range from 1 to 7 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the average cost-per-transit is estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$6,750 (5 hrs at approximately $1,350 per hour) for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tankers, in 1994 dollars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assessment estimates that the first-year cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations (1995) will be $11.4 million, and the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discounted program cost (1995 to 2015) will be $57.7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million, in 1990 dollars. The tanker industry can reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these costs by switching to double-hulled tankers earlier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than assumed in the Assessment, or it can increase these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs by continuing to use double-sided or double-bottomed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tankers after 2010. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original preliminary Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempted to statistically estimate the benefits of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The Coast Guard has subsequently determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that there is no statistical basis for such estimations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without making extreme assumptions of debatable validity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is because the occurrence of a steering or propulsion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure is not related to the size of the tanker or its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cargo capacity. Further, such failures do not necessarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in a collision or grounding, nor do collisions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groundings necessarily result in rupture of cargo tank(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
And even if a tank were ruptured, there is no predicting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual amount of outflow that would occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the final Assessment makes a presumption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness by assuming that the regulations would avert 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least one collision or grounding that would otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spill 300,000 barrels of oil (This is derived from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximate capacity of two cargo tanks on a midsize oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanker of 80,000 DWT.). This averted oil spill could occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at any time during the 15-year period from 1995 (the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full year that the regulations will be in effect) to 2010 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(when the last single hull oil tanker is phased out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The monetary benefits of these regulations include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoided cleanup costs, third-party compensation (lost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earnings to fishermen, etc.) and natural resource damages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, these costs have varied enormously from spill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to spill because of the great range of factors affecting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of oil spills, such as type of product, environment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of year, location, and weather conditions. Accordingly, it is not possible to establish a definitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monetized (dollar) benefit value for unspilled oil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Assessment does not perform benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations using dollar amounts. Instead, it uses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unspilled oil quantity, discounted at 7 percent back to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990 barrels. If the averted 300,000 barrel spill were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed to occur in 1995, the discounted quantity would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
213,896 barrels. If it were assumed to occur in 2010, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discounted quantity would be 77,526 barrels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the final Assessment has determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cost of these regulations ranges from $270 to $744 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discounted barrel of unspilled oil.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has evaluated the impact of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking on small entities in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entity impact analysis is incorporated into the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the NPRM and public hearings, only six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments have been received to date concerning the impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escort regulations on small businesses. The comments stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the regulations would have detrimental economic impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on small businesses in the Puget Sound region if tallow and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vegetable oil cargoes were included. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations do not include non-petroleum oil cargoes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard has determined that most of the tankers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are affected by the regulation in Prince William Sound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Puget Sound are owned either by oil companies or large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipping corporations. Since few small entities will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule establishes standards and requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the escort of single hull tankers over 5,000 GT in Prince 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
William Sound, Alaska and Puget Sound (and certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated waters around Puget Sound), Washington. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to regulate such traffic is delegated to the Coast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guard by the Secretary of Transportation whose authority is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed by statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While these regulations establish minimal requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for escort of certain tanker traffic through these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated areas, the Coast Guard does not intend to preempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the states from issuing more stringent requirements provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are not in direct conflict with Federal law or this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking.

The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking and concluded that the preparation of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impact statement is not necessary. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Assessment and a Finding of No Significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impact are available in the docket for inspection or copying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary effect of the regulation will be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in the probability of petroleum oil spills in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Puget and Prince William Sounds. The only other impact will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a minor increase in vessel traffic (escort vessels) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moving through Puget and Prince William Sounds: the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated 1,276 additional escort vessel transits per year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent an average of 3 to 4 additional vessels per day; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this will decrease as single hull tankers are phased out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service.

Purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This part prescribes regulations in accordance with section 4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub.
L. 101&hyph;380). The regulations will reduce the risk of oil spills from laden, single hull tankers over 5,000 GT
by requiring that these tankers be escorted by at least two suitable escort vessels. The escort vessels will be immediately
available to influence the tankers' speed and course in the event of a steering or propulsion equipment failure, thereby
reducing the possibility of groundings or collisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The regulations in this part establish minimum escort vessel requirements. Nothing in these regulations should
be construed as relieving the master of a tanker from the duty to operate the vessel in a safe and prudent manner, taking
into account the navigational constraints of the waterways to be traversed, other vessel traffic, and anticipated
weather, tide, and sea conditions, which may require reduced speeds, greater assistance from escort vessels, or
other operational precautions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escort vessels to move into assist positions, including, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate, pre-tethering the escort vessels at crucial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points along the route; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The preparations required on the tanker and escort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels, and the methods employed in making an emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
towline connection, including stationing of deck crews, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of messenger lines, bridles, and other towing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gear, and energizing appropriate deck equipment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The manner in which an emergency towline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection would be made (which escort vessel will respond, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how messengers and towlines will be passed, etc.); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Other relevant information provided by the tanker 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule sets forth regulations that require air carriers, air taxi, and commercial operators to provide duty
period scheduling limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants engaged in air transportation and air
commerce. This action results from public and congressional interest in regulating flight attendant work hours
and from data contained in a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) study of industry practice relating to flight
attendant flight, duty, and rest times. This rule contributes to an improved aviation safety system by providing
the opportunity for flight attendants to be rested sufficiently to perform their routine and emergency safety duties.

Statement of the Problem
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Flight attendants are crewmembers who perform essential routine and emergency safety duties. Routine duties include
ensuring that carry-on baggage is correctly stowed; verifying that exit seating requirements are met, that passenger
seat belts are fastened, and that galley service times are properly stowed; and conducting passenger briefings before
takeoff. Emergency duties include conducting land and water evacuations, controlling inflight fires, handling
passengers who threaten the safety of other passengers or the flight, managing medical emergencies such as passenger
illness or injury, managing inflight emergencies such as smoke or fire in the cabin, and managing turbulent air penetrations,
airplane decompression, and hijackings. Additionally, because flight attendants are crewmembers performing
safety-related functions, they must satisfactorily complete indoctrination, initial, transition, and recurrent
training requirements. In addition, they are subject to the alcohol and drug use regulations and drug testing regulations.
Currently, flight attendants are the only safety-sensitive aviation group that has no regulations with respect
to flight, duty, or rest periods. Such regulations exist for flight crewmembers, dispatchers, air traffic control
tower operators, and aviation maintenance technicians.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is comparable to flight, duty, and rest requirements for other safety-sensitive aviation groups
because it enhances public safety by requiring ``rest periods'' and limiting duty periods for flight attendants.
These requirements protect flight attendants from work related fatigue that interferes with their ability to perform
essential safety duties. No accident/incident data currently exists to provide a direct correlation between flight
attendant fatigue and passenger survivability. However, the FAA recognizes that a flight attendant who is excessively
fatigued is less likely to be capable of performing safety duties than an adequately rested flight attendant. This
is an unacceptable safety risk. Therefore, the FAA adopts this final rule in the interest of air transportation and
air commerce safety. The justification stated herein includes that which was included in Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
No. 93&hyph;3, published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1985, the FAA received two petitions for rulemaking requesting limits on flight and duty hours for flight attendants.
One petition
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 sought to establish flight and duty time regulations similar to current regulations for flight crewmembers. The
other petition
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 recommended establishing maximum duty time limits and minimum daily, weekly, and monthly rest periods. Both petitions
recommended certain flight time limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants that were more restrictive
than those that existed for flight crewmembers. The FAA denied both petitions in a Denial of Petition issued on January
23, 1989, because the action sought by the petitioners was not warranted by the information, views, and arguments
contained in the petitions.

Congressional legislation (H.R. 638 and S. 1170) was introduced in 1989 to establish flight attendant duty time limitations.
On May 17, 1989, the Subcommittee on Aviation of the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation held a public
hearing on H.R. 638. At the hearing, the FAA stated its intent to initiate further studies of air carrier flight attendant
scheduling practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA completed its ``Report on the Study of Current Industry Practice-Flight Attendant Flight, Duty, and Rest
Times'' on September 12, 1989 (hereafter referred to as ``the Industry Study'' [Docket No. 27229]), and submitted
a copy of the study to the House Subcommittee on Aviation. The study focused on U.S. air carrier scheduling practices
and flight attendant actual work hours and highlighted cases of extended duty periods and minimum rest periods. The
study indicated that flight attendant duty hour problems may occur more frequently among certain industry segments
because of fundamental operational differences. The study noted that most air carriers had policies to address these
problems. The study provided a framework for the FAA to address this issue with appropriate regulatory action, which
is provided in this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The House Subcommittee on Aviation held another hearing on flight attendant duty and rest on March 13, 1991. The FAA
did not recommend rulemaking at that hearing. Subsequent legislation on flight attendant duty and rest, H.R. 14,
was passed in the House of Representatives. In 1992, the language of H.R. 14 was incorporated into a provision in the
House and Senate versions of the FAA's appropriations bill; however, that provision was deleted later by the conference
committee. On January 5, 1993, H.R. 14 was reintroduced in the House of Representatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 26, 1993, the FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), Notice No. 93&hyph;3, Flight Attendant Duty
Period Limitations and Rest Requirements (58 FR 17024; March 31, 1993) that proposed duty period scheduling limitations
and rest requirements for flight attendants engaged in air transportation and air commerce. The FAA has incorporated
into this final rule comments on the NPRM received from the public during the comment period, as appropriate.

Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fifty-one commenters submitted comments in response to the NPRM. The commenters included trade and professional
associations, individual flight attendants, labor organizations, part 121 and 135 operators, public interest
groups, a government agency, a Member of Congress, and other individuals. Among the commenters were the Air Line Pilots
Association (ALPA); the Air Transport Association (ATA); the Allied Pilots Association (APA); the American Cyanamid
Company; AMR Combs; the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions; Delta Airlines; Great American Airways; the National
Air Carrier Association (NACA); the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB); North American Airlines (NAA);
the Regional Airline Association (RAA); Southwest Airlines (SWA); Sun Country Airlines (SCA); Transport Workers
Union Local 556 (TWU Local 556)_Southwest Airlines; and flight attendants, some of whom are employed by America West
Airlines; Continental Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Sun Country Airlines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters addressed general and specific issues such as scheduled versus unscheduled operations; the application
of flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants; rest period requirements; duty period
requirements; augmented crew requirements; reserve and deadhead status for flight attendants; flight attendant
responsibility; the costs contained in the initial regulatory evaluation; and the implementation period for this
final rule. Commenters also addressed the issues of flight attendant fatigue, the Industry Study, international
versus domestic operations, part 125 operations, and flight attendant duty limitations and rest regulations in
other nations.

Overview of the General Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thirty-nine comments addressed the concept of regulating flight attendant duty period limitations and minimum
``rest period'' requirements. Fourteen comments did not support establishing flight attendant duty period limitations
and rest requirements while 18 comments did support establishing such limits and requirements based on certain revisions
to the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters who supported regulating flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements included
ALPA, APA, The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, NTSB, nine commenters who identified themselves as flight attendants,
and a member of Congress who strongly supports the comments of the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions. The commenters
stated that, because a flight attendant's primary duties are safety related, establishing regulations would enhance
public safety.

The 14 commenters who did not support the NPRM include Great American Airways, RAA, SCA, and nine commenters who identified
themselves as flight attendants. Several of the commenters who identified themselves as flight attendants stated
that the provisions in the NPRM would limit a flight attendant's opportunities to work extra trips and that flight
attendants are capable of handling safety procedures and emergencies even when working longer duty periods.

Apply Flight Crewmember Flight, Duty, and Rest Requirements to Flight Attendants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, the FAA invited comments on the possibility of modifying the proposed rule, as presented in the NPRM, to
add an option for operators to either follow the proposed duty limitations and rest requirements or apply flight crewmember
flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eleven commenters responded to the FAA's request for comments. Seven of the commenters supported the option to permit
operators to either follow the proposed duty limitations and rest requirements or apply flight crewmember requirements
to flight attendants. Three commenters opposed the option. Although Delta Air Lines did not oppose the option, it
expressed no interest in exercising the option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA, Great American Airways, NACA, RAA, and Southwest Airlines agreed that operators should be permitted to apply
flight crewmember requirements to flight attendants. ATA specified that applying flight crewmember requirements
should remain an option at the operator's discretion. Great American Airways, Horizon Air, NACA, RAA, and Southwest
Airlines noted that there are scheduling and economic advantages to using the same set of rules of flight crewmembers
and flight attendants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions and SCA opposed establishing the option to permit operators to apply flight
crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants. The Coalition of Flight Attendants Unions
stated that flight crewmember rules do not provide adequate protection from fatigue. SCA noted that, if this option
had been a requirement in 1992, SCA would have had to hire an additional 20 flight attendants. According to SCA, the
cost burden of hiring 20 flight attendants would have increased SCA domestic operating costs by $1.75 million.

FAA Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA recognizes that giving operators the option to apply flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements
to flight attendants provides additional scheduling flexibility and eliminates the need for an operator to have
two sets of scheduling requirements for its flight crewmembers and flight attendants. This provision also will permit
flight attendants on such operations to be scheduled with the same limitations as the flight crewmembers. Therefore,
the FAA has adopted this option, which appears in &sect;&sect;121.467(c) and 135.273(c) of this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an operator chooses to apply flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants, the operator
must establish written procedures for applying the requirements and the procedures must be approved by the Administrator
and referenced in the certificate holder's operations specifications. The written procedures must apply to all
flight attendants used in the certificate holders operation. In addition, written procedures must be applied to
the certificate holder's entire operation. Certificate holders may obtain approval by submitting their procedures
for preliminary review and approval to the principal operations inspectors assigned to them at the FAA Flight Standards
District Offices that are charged with the overall inspection of their operations. This approval process is similar
to those used for exit seating and passenger carry-on baggage requirements. Because flight crewmember regulations
were designed specifically for pilots, FAA approval is required to ensure that flight crewmember rules are adequately
applied to flight attendants. In addition, the written procedures for domestic, flag, and supplemental air carriers
and for commercial operators must apply the flight crewmember limitations contained in subparts Q, R, or S of part
121, except for the provisions for on-board rest facilities, as appropriate to the operation being conducted. Therefore,
operators must consider the type of operation being conducted for each flight segment when scheduling flight attendants
according to the option.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the written procedures for establishing duty period limitations and rest requirements for operators
certificated under part 135 must include the limitations contained in subpart F, except for provisions for on-board
rest facilities, as appropriate to the operation being conducted. Part 121 and 135 certificate holders are required
to provide flight attendants on aircraft with certain passenger seating configurations in accordance with &sect;&sect;121.391,
135.107, or the certificate holder's operations specifications, as appropriate. The number of flight attendants
required on an aircraft to meet the provisions of &sect;&sect;121.391, 135.107, or the certificate holder's operations
specifications, whichever is greater, is referred to as the minimum flight attendant crew complement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any operator that elects the option to apply flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants
and has established written procedures for augmenting the minimum flight crewmember complement must establish
procedures for augmenting the minimum flight attendant complement. The augmenting procedures must be based on the
number of flight crewmembers assigned to the flight that is in addition to the minimum flight crewmember complement
as specified in the aircraft type certificate data sheet. For example, if the minimum flight crewmember complement
on a Boeing 747&hyph;300 is three, as specified in the aircraft type certificate data sheet, an operator that schedules
four flight crewmembers for an extended long-range flight will be required to schedule one flight attendant in addition
to the minimum flight attendant crew complement that is required by &sect;&sect;121.391, 135.107, or the certificate
holder's operations specifications. For example, if the operations specifications for a certain airplane requires
8 flight attendants, and if the operator adds 1 flight crewmember, that operator would be required to add 1 additional
flight attendant, for a total of 9 flight attendants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, any operator that elects the option of applying the flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements
to flight attendants, must ensure that the definition of ``rest period'' in this final rule is applied to those flight
attendants. (See the detailed discussion on ``Rest Period Requirements'' and ``Reserve Status, Stand-by Status,
or Similar Assignments'' in this final rule.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provision for applying flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants, if
the Administrator finds that revisions to the written procedures are necessary for the continued adequacy of the
procedures for applying flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants, the Administrator
will require the operator to make necessary changes within 30 days after being notified by the Administrator. In addition,
an operator may petition the Administrator to reconsider the notice to change the procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This procedure for requiring changes is consistent with the current regulatory language for aircraft inspection
programs and pilot training programs contained in &sect;&sect;91.415 and 121.405, respectively, as well as a number
of other regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any operator that establishes written procedures to apply the flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements
to flight attendants and that subsequently wishes to revise this practice and schedule flight attendants according
to the duty period limitations and rest requirements in &sect;&sect;121.467 or 135.273 must amend their operations
specifications in accordance with &sect;&sect;121.79(c) and 135.17(b). These sections require a certificate
holder to file an application for an amendment of operations specifications at least 15 days before the effective
date proposed by the applicant for the amendment, unless a shorter filing period is approved by the Flight Standards
District Office charged with the overall inspection of the certificate holder.

The NPRM proposed duty period limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants in all domestic, flag, supplemental,
and commercial operations conducted under part 121 and part 125, and in all operations conducted under part 135. No
new requirements for operations conducted under part 91 were proposed. The FAA received comments from part 121 and
135 operators about the applicability of the proposed requirements to certain unscheduled operations. Those commenters
included AMR Combs, ATA, American Cyanamid Company, Delta Airlines, Great American Airways, North American Airlines,
and Southwest Airlines.

ATA, Delta Airlines, North American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines said that the proposed duty period limitations
and rest requirements should not apply to military flights, e.g., Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) and Military Airlift
Command (MAC). ATA and Southwest Airlines also said that special charters for sports teams should be excluded from
duty period limitations and rest requirements. Commenters stated that because of the short notification associated
with military and special charters it would not be possible to obtain a waiver from the regulation to conduct them.
North American Airlines stated that the proposed requirements should not apply to flights flown to remote destinations
on a weekly or ad hoc basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AMR Combs and American Cyanamid Company believe that the proposed requirements should not apply to operations that
do not require a flight attendant. AMR Combs stated that many unscheduled operators do not employ full-time flight
attendants and that a flight attendant may serve more than one certificate holder.

In response to commenters who stated that the proposed duty period limitations and rest requirements should not apply
to military flights and special charters, this final rule does not except military or special charter operations
from duty period limitations and rest requirements. If a certificate holder chooses to apply the flight crewmember
flight, duty, and rest time limitations option to flight attendants when conducting military and special charter
flights to retain operational flexibility by scheduling the flight attendants with the flight crewmembers, &sect;&sect;121.467(c)
and 135.272(c) require that the flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements option be applied to all flight
operations conducted by the certificate holder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to AMR Combs and American Cyanamid Company, the FAA agrees with these commenters. The final rule will not
apply to those operations where flight attendants are not required. However, all flight attendants who are assigned
to duties in an aircraft for operations that require a flight attendant, including flight attendants in excess of
the minimum flight attendant crew complement, are subject to duty limitations and rest requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, an operator conducting operations on an aircraft with 19 passenger seats or less, which does not require
a flight attendant under &sect;135.107, will not be required to meet flight attendant duty period limitations and
rest requirements for flights conducted on that aircraft. However, if the operator's operations specifications
state that the operator will provide a flight attendant for flights on that aircraft, then the operation does require
a flight attendant. Therefore, for any flight attendant assigned to flight duties on that aircraft the certificate
holder is required to meet the duty period limitations and rest requirements of &sect;135.273.

Duty Period Limitations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed limiting flight attendant duty periods. Proposed &sect;&sect;121.466(a) and 135.273(a) defined
a duty period as the period of elapsed time between reporting for an assignment involving flight time and release from
that assignment by the certificate holder. The NPRM proposed that the time be calculated using either Coordinated
Universal Time or the local time of the flight attendant's home base.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eleven commenters submitted comments supporting or recommending revisions to this proposed definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta Air Lines, Southwest Air Lines, and TWU Local 556 agreed with the FAA's proposed definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ALPA, APA, and the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions stated that duty periods should include non-flight duties.
ALPA noted that ground duties can be as fatiguing as flight duties. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions recommended
that the definition of a duty period be replaced with: ``Any continuous period during which a flight attendant is required
to carry out any task associated with the business of an aircraft operator.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the definition of duty period explicitly excludes reserve status, ATA recommended that the following
phrase be added to the definition of duty period: ```Duty period' does not include time when a flight attendant is on
reserve status assignment, free of any specifically assigned duties other than to report for a flight assignment
within a specified period of time, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or company work rules.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to receiving comments on the definition of a duty period, the FAA also received comments on the duty period
limitations proposed in the NPRM. The NPRM proposed to limit flight attendant duty periods based on the length of the
duty period, the number of flight attendants assigned to a crew, and the amount of rest following the duty period. The
proposed rule contained provisions (proposed &sect;&sect;121.466(b) and 135.273(b)) to prohibit an operator
from assigning a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours unless certain conditions are met.
An operator would be allowed to assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period up to 20 hours, if the operator:
(1) Assigns flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement; and (2) schedules an extended
rest period following the duty period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirteen commenters submitted comments on issues pertaining to flight attendant duty period limits. The comments
addressed the use of ``scheduled'' versus ``actual'' duty periods, addressed the effect of the proposed duty limits
on unscheduled operators, made recommendations to the proposals, and provided proposed duty period limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, Southwest Airlines, and TWU Local 556 addressed the use of ``scheduled''
duty periods as opposed to ``actual'' duty periods. Southwest Airlines and TWU Local 556 agreed that the proposed
duty period limitations should be ``scheduled,'' not ``actual.'' TWU Local 556 stated that, if this flexibility
is not retained, the following would occur: (1) Flight attendants would be replaced after 14 hours of actual duty,
which inconveniences passengers and causes delays because of the need to locate crew replacements; (2) reserves
would be placed at out stations; (3) crews would be rerouted to cover flights that the original crews cannot perform;
(4) flight attendants would lose days off and have their schedules disrupted; (5) additional costs for crews and stranded
passengers would be incurred; and (6) aircraft repositioning would be required. However, the Coalition stated that
there is no justification for having no limit on actual hours and added that the actual number of flight attendant duty
hours per day needs to be limited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AMR Combs stated that scheduled duty period limitations should apply only to scheduled operations with more than
19 passenger seats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters, including NAA, recommended revisions to the proposed duty period limitations. NAA recommended
that a layover of 4 to 5 hours during which a hotel room is provided should not count as duty time. Other comments recommended
limiting duty to: (1) 16 hours in 24 hours with 11 hours of flight time in domestic operations; (2) 30 hours in 5 days;
(3) 16 hours with no more than 10 hours of flight time; or (4) 12 hours for flights with multiple stops.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions submitted an alternative proposal to the NPRM that included duty period
limitations. This alternative divided duty period limitations according to domestic, international, and long-range
flights. The Coalition's alternative proposed to limit: (1) Scheduled duty periods on domestic flights to no more
than 14 hours and actual duty periods to 15 hours; (2) scheduled duty periods on international flights to no more than
16 hours and actual duty periods to 17 hours; and (3) actual duty periods on long-range flights to no more than 4 hours
greater than the scheduled duty time, not to exceed 20 hours. The Coalition distinguished between domestic and international
duty periods and stated that it reluctantly includes a 20-hour duty period for long range international flights to
accommodate new generation aircraft, but only if additional rest is provided.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In establishing duty period limitations, the FAA has considered a variety of alternatives submitted by commenters,
including the proposals to set different limits for different types of operations. In an effort to establish requirements
that are conducive to safety and compatible with air carrier operations, the FAA also has reviewed current industry
practices used to schedule flight attendants. To provide the least complicated method of establishing effective
limitations for scheduling duty periods for flight attendants, the FAA has decided to adopt the scheduled duty period
limitations as proposed, with a slight modification that distinguishes cosmetic and international scheduled duty
periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has revised the definition of a duty period in this final rule to state that the time is calculated using Coordinated
Universal Time or local time to reflect the total elapsed time. The phrase ``or the local time of the flight attendants's
home base'' was replaced with ``or local time'' to be consistent with the definition of a calendar day. The FAA has determined
that any time zone can be used, as long as the operator is consistent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Duty period limitations are established to enhance the safety of the flying public by ensuring that flight attendants
do not become overly fatigued during flight assignments. In addition, the duty period limitations are designed to
suit all operations that require flight attendants without imposing a significant burden on operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, the final rule does not provide actual duty period limitations
because such provisions may unreasonably reduce operational flexibility. However, the final rule requires that
a flight attendant ``be given'' a scheduled rest period between scheduled duty periods, i.e., rest periods must be
provided. Because duty periods are scheduled in combination with actual rest periods, the objective of ensuring
the flight attendants are provided an opportunity to be rested will be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After further review of the Coalition comments and an analysis of flight schedules, the FAA finds that scheduled duty
periods of operations wholly within the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia should not be allowed to
exceed 18 hours. The FAA is not aware of any scheduled duty periods for these operations that currently do exceed 18
hours. However, duty periods that contain one or more flights that land or take off outside the contiguous 48 states
and the District of Columbia may extend up to 20 hours, provided that an extended rest period is scheduled following
the duty period and that additional flight attendants are assigned to each flight segment in the duty period. This
provision will allow air carriers to conduct extended long-range operations with new generation aircraft. Moreover,
sections 121.467(b)(14) and 135.273(b)(14) will allow a flight attendant for a domestic air carrier to continue
on duty beyond the time when duty would normally terminate, if circumstances exist that are unanticipated and beyond
the control of the air carrier such as adverse whether conditions). This same exception will apply to flag and supplemental
operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A duty period as defined in this final rule means the period of elapsed time between reporting for an assignment involving
flight time and release from that assignment. In response to ATA's recommendation that the definition of a duty period
should state that a duty period does not include the time when a flight attendant is assigned to reserve status, the
FAA refers to the definition of a duty period in &sect;&sect;121.467(a) and 135.273(a) of the final rule, which indicates
that a duty period does not begin until a flight attendant reports for an assignment involving flight time. Reserve
status is discussed in further detail under the heading ``Reserve Status, Stand-by Status, or Similar Assignments.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to NAA, all duty period assignments, including those assignments with a 4- to 5-hour break in duty at a hotel,
must be assigned within duty period limitations and must meet minimum rest requirements. The FAA would not consider
this to be a break in, or cessation of, the duty period.

Sections 121.466(i) and 135.273(i) of the NPRM proposed that an operator be permitted to reduce a 12-hour rest period
to 10 hours following a duty period of more than 14 hours. In conjunction with this proposed provision, the FAA also
proposed &sect;&sect;121.466(j) and 135.273(j), which would limit the scheduled duty period following a 10-hour
reduced rest period to less than 14 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA, Delta Air Lines, and NACA submitted comments on limiting duty periods following reduced rest. The commenters

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta Air Lines also recommended that the phrase ``14 or more hours'' appearing in proposed &sect;&sect;121.466(j)

The FAA has adopted this provision as proposed so that air carriers will not be penalized for operational delays such
as those due to weather and air traffic control. The FAA recognizes that delays are costly and that operators avoid
delays whenever possible. Sections 121.467(b)(14) and 135.273(b)(14) of this final rule apply to flights that are
assigned and scheduled and that normally terminate within allowable duty limitations. However, this provision
does not apply to operational delays relating to flight attendant staffing problems. A flight attendant's duty period
begins when the flight attendant reports for a flight assignment and ends when the flight attendant is released by
the air carrier. Changes to a flight attendant's schedule after a duty period begins must be made in accordance with
the duty period limitations and rest requirements set forth in this final rule. In addition, if a flight attendant
reports for duty and is later reassigned, the scheduled duty time before reassignment must be counted as part of the
total duty period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A flight attendant is scheduled for a 13-hour duty period on flight staffed with the minimum cabin crew complement.
The duty period consists of two flight segments_a flight from New York to Frankfurt followed by a flight from Frankfurt
to Rome. Because of adverse weather conditions, the flight leaving New York is delayed 2 hours, causing the flight
attendant's duty period to exceed the scheduled 14-hour duty period limitation. Although it is apparent at the time
of departure that the flight attendant's duty period will exceed 14 hours, completion of the assignment will still
comply with duty period limitations, because the flight attendant was scheduled and assigned to flights that normally
terminate within the allowable duty period limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if, for example, the flight attendant is reassigned in Frankfurt to a flight to Athens, the flight attendant's
revised scheduled duty period cannot exceed a total of 14 scheduled hours, unless the flight attendant crew is augmented
in accordance with &sect;&sect;121.467 (b)(4), (b)(5), or (b)(6), as appropriate, and each flight attendant is
given the minimum required rest. The flight attendant's duty period did not start over in Frankfurt because of the
reassignment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA received numerous comments on issues related to the rest requirements proposed in the NPRM. Commenters addressed
issues including the definition of a rest period, scheduled rest versus actual rest, minimum rest, reduced rest,
subsequent rest, relief from duty in air transportation and air commerce for 24 consecutive hours of rest in any 7 consecutive
calendar days, and on-board rest requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM defined a rest period as the period when a flight attendant is free of all restraint or duty for a domestic, flag,
or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator and is free of all responsibility for work or duty should the occasion
arise. ATA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, and Southwest Airlines recommended revisions to the definition
of rest period. The comments submitted by ATA and the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions addressed reserve status
in their recommended definitions of rest. Southwest Airlines stated that the definition of rest period should be
defined as actual hours of rest, not scheduled hours of rest. Two commenters, including Delta Airlines, agreed with
the definition of rest period as proposed in the NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed requirements for scheduling rest and reduced rest periods. Sections 121.466 (c) and (h) and 135.273
(c) and (h) of the NPRM proposed requiring that a flight attendant scheduled for 14 hours or less of duty be given 9 consecutive
hours of rest, and that a flight attendant scheduled for more than 14 hours but less than 20 hours be given 12 consecutive
hours of rest. Proposed &sect;&sect;121.466 (d) and (i) and 135.273 (d) and (i) proposed permitting an air carrier
or commercial operator to reduce these rest periods to 8 and 10 consecutive hours, respectively. Three commenters
(Southwest Airlines, TWU Local 556, and TWU of America) supported the minimum rest requirements proposed in the NPRM
and also indicated that the rest requirements should not be increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RAA expressed concern that the requirement to provide 9 hours of rest for duty periods of more than 14 hours implies
that a flight attendant who reports for a flight that is canceled is required to receive 9 hours of rest before the next
duty period begins.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters, including APA and individual flight attendants, indicated that the actual time available for rest during
a rest period is often less than the scheduled rest period and may be as much as 2 to 31/2 hours less than the number of hours
scheduled in the rest period. The commenters stated that this often occurs because of time lost due to assisting passengers
in deplaning, travel to and from a rest facility, and other activities such as eating. One commenter stated that it
may take 35 minutes to 1 hour for passengers to deplane, for the crew to gather its belongings, and for travel to the hotel;
1 hour to eat; and 1 to 11/2 hours to prepare for duty again and travel back to the airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received several alternatives to the proposed rest requirements. APA recommended that a flight attendant
scheduled for a duty period of 14 hours or less be given a scheduled rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours. The
rest period could be reduced but not scheduled as a reduced rest period as long as the rest period is reasonably calculated
to provide 8 consecutive hours at a suitable rest facility and the flight attendant is provided a subsequent rest period
of at least 11 consecutive hours. Under the APA proposal, scheduled rest periods and reduced rest periods would have
to occur during the 24-hour period preceding the scheduled end of a duty period. APA recommended that a flight attendant
scheduled for a duty period of more than 14 hours but no more than 18 hours be given a scheduled rest period of at least
12 consecutive hours. This rest period could not be reduced and must occur after the completion of the scheduled duty
period and immediately prior to the commencement of the subsequent duty period. The Coalition of Flight Attendant
Unions proposed rest requirements based on domestic and international operations (see the discussion of Domestic
and International Operations). The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions' proposal recommended a minimum of 10 hours
of rest following domestic flights, 12 hours of rest following international flights, and a rest period equal to twice
the scheduled flight time for long-range international flights. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions' proposal
did not include a provision for reduced rest. RAA requested that minimum rest requirements for flight attendants
be aligned with flight crewmember requirements. One commenter suggested that a rest period should be at least 91/2
hours at a hotel or 12 hours from the time of release to the beginning of the next report. Another commenter stated that
the proposed minimum subsequent rest is satisfactory for domestic flights but not realistic for international flights.
The commenter suggested that the rest period following international flights should be 24 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended that the FAA establish provisions for on-board rest. APA recommended that a domestic,
flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator be permitted to assign a flight attendant to a scheduled
duty period of more than 14 hours, but no more than 16 hours, if the inflight duties assigned to flight attendants by
the air carrier or commercial operator were such that each of the cabin crew could be free of all duty for ``25 percent
of the scheduled block time less 1 hour.'' APA stated that reclining seats suitable for rest reserved for 25 percent
of the assigned attendant complement would have to be available throughout the flight. APA also recommended that
a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator be permitted to assign a flight attendant to
a scheduled duty period of more than 16 hours, but no more than 18 hours, if the inflight duties assigned to flight attendants
by the air carrier or commercial operator were such that each of the cabin crew could be free of all duty for ``33 percent
of the scheduled block time less 1 hour.'' APA added that reclining seats suitable for rest reserved for 33 percent
of the assigned attendant complement would have to be available throughout the flight. The Coalition of Flight Attendant
Unions recommended that a flight attendant be provided at least 1 hour of continuous rest for any flight segment scheduled
for 8 or more hours of flight time, and that a passenger seat or bunk be assigned for crew rest.

This final rule adopts the definition of rest period and the minimum rest requirements as proposed in the NPRM. The
FAA has considered the various rest requirement alternatives proposed by commenters and has determined that the
rest requirements proposed in the NPRM and adopted in this final rule are adequate to ensure that flight attendants
are provided the opportunity to be sufficiently rested to perform their routine and emergency safety duties without
imposing a significant burden on operators. A discussion of the comments recommending that reserve status be addressed
in the definition of rest is contained under the heading, ``Reserve Status, Stand-by Status, or Similar Assignments.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to Southwest Airlines' comment that rest should be ``actual'' hours of rest and not ``scheduled,'' the
FAA considers that the opportunity to rest, as provided by the rest period, to be ``actual'' rest. As proposed in the
NPRM, this final rule requires that a flight attendant ``be given'' a scheduled rest period. This provision makes
the operator responsible for ensuring that a flight attendant is scheduled for and receives the scheduled rest period.
The FAA recognizes that how the flight attendant utilizes this rest period cannot be regulated. Requiring operators
to schedule rest periods ensures that flight attendants know in advance when rest periods will occur and that they
will be of a specified duration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A minimum rest period of 9 consecutive hours is required for all duty period assignments of 14 hours or less, unless
the rest period is reduced in accordance with &sect;121.467(b)(3) or &sect;135.273(b)(3). A flight attendant who
reports for duty to find that the flight has been canceled would have begun a duty period and would require minimum rest.
However, in response to RAA's concern, a carrier could either keep the flight attendant on duty for reassignment or
release the flight attendant for a complete rest period.

Rest periods are required to occur between the completion of a scheduled duty period and the commencement of a subsequent
duty period. Consequently, this final rule does not require that a required rest period be given immediately prior
to a flight assignment. Because duty periods are defined as assignments involving flight time, a rest period is not
required following assignments that do not involve flight time, such as training or ground duty assignments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to commenters who indicated that the actual time available to rest is typically less than scheduled rest,
the FAA considers a flight attendant to be free of all restraint or duty upon release from an assignment involving flight
time. The FAA understands that the time available for sleep during a rest period may vary depending on the amount of
time a flight attendant spends in other activities during the rest period. The FAA also recognizes that it cannot compel
a flight attendant to use rest periods for actual rest.

Sections 121.466 (d) and (i) and 135.273 (d) and (i) of the NPRM included provisions for operators to schedule 8-hour
and 10-hour reduced rest periods in conjunction with certain scheduled duty period limitations. ALPA stated that
a rest period should never be scheduled for less than 10 consecutive hours. However, ALPA believes that it may be permissible
for an operator to reduce a rest period to less than 10 hours because of circumstances beyond the control of the certificate
holder. APA opposed the concept of reduced rest and stated that an air carrier or commercial operator should not be
permitted to schedule a reduced rest period.

The FAA has adopted the reduced rest provisions as proposed. This final rule permits an air carrier or commercial operator
to schedule a flight attendant for reduced rest. However, no flight attendant will receive a rest period of less than
8 hours. This provision enables operators to retain a certain degree of scheduling flexibility. The reduced rest
provision is adopted in conjunction with the requirement to schedule a longer rest period subsequent to an 8- or 10-hour
reduced rest period. Together, these provisions prevent a flight attendant from being assigned two consecutive
reduced minimum rest periods and are designed to protect flight attendants by minimizing the effects of cumulative
fatigue.

24-Consecutive-Hour Rest Period During Any 7 Consecutive Calendar Days
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 121.466(n) and 135.273(n) of the NPRM proposed that a certificate holder be required to relieve a flight
attendant engaged in air transportation or air commerce from all further duty for at least 24 consecutive hours during
any 7 consecutive calendar days. For convenience, hereafter, this requirement will be referred to as the 24-hour-in-7-day
rest requirement. Proposed &sect;&sect;121.466(a) and 135.273(a) of the NPRM defined a calendar day as the period
of elapsed time, using Coordinated Universal Time or local time, that begins at midnight and ends 24 hours later. Labor
organizations, operators, and an association commented on the proposed 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several of the comments submitted included discussion of the term ``calendar day.'' ATA stated that the term ``calendar
day'' is confusing because it is unclear on which day an assignment begins or ends. APA stated that the term calendar
day should specify that the local time used is that of the flight attendant's home base. In the Coalition of Flight Attendant
Unions' alternative to the NPRM, the Coalition deleted the definition of the term ``calendar day'' but retained the
provision for 24 consecutive hours of rest in 7 consecutive calendar days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA and Delta Air Lines recommended that the FAA revise the proposed 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement by replacing
the phrase ``every 7 consecutive calendar days'' with the phrase ``every 168-consecutive-hour period.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southwest Airlines and TWU Local 556 requested that the final rule permit a flight attendant to voluntarily waive
the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement in order to be able to work extra hours. Southwest Airlines states that, if
flight attendants cannot waive this provision, Southwest would be required to hire an additional 100 flight attendants
at an initial cost of $710,000 and an annual recurring cost of $660,000. TWU Local 556 stated that they applied this
provision to a sample of 13 flight attendant schedules for February 1993. According to TWU Local 556, if the 13 flight
attendants were not permitted to fly their schedule, which had been altered to include extra flights, each flight
attendant would have lost $11,063 in extra annual income. The total lost income for 2,200 flight attendants would
be $24 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA and Delta Air Lines recommended that the FAA include a provision in the final rule similar to a statement included
in the preamble to the NPRM that indicated that the requirement for a 24-consecutive-hour rest period in any 7 consecutive
calendar days could be postponed under certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AMR Combs and American Cyanamid Company noted that current &sect;&sect;135.267(f) and 135.269(d) require unscheduled
operators to provide flight crewmembers with at least 13 rest periods of at least 24 consecutive hours in each calendar
quarter. AMR Combs stated that the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement proposed in the NPRM only should apply to scheduled
operations. American Cyanamid Company suggested that flight attendants could be required to meet pilot weekly rest
requirements as an alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments submitted included: (1) A recommendation by TWU Local 556 that the FAA could require four 24-hour breaks
in 30 days or require a 12-hour rest preceding the seventh duty day; and (2) a Carnival Airlines flight service schedule
indicating that a flight attendant had been scheduled for 11 consecutive days of duty without receiving a 24-consecutive-hour
rest period.

The 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement is designed to supplement daily rest requirements and to ensure that flight
attendants receive the opportunity to obtain adequate rest. The FAA proposed the definition of a calendar day to provide
a unit of measure that could be used to determine whether the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement is met. In response
to ATA's concern that the term ``calendar day'' causes confusion, the FAA refers to the definition of ``calendar day''
in &sect;&sect;121.467(a) and 135.273(a) of the final rule, which indicates that a calendar day begins at midnight
and ends 24 hours later at the next midnight. ``Seven consecutive calendar days'' as used in &sect;&sect;121.467
and 135.273 of this final rule means a period of 7 consecutive days beginning at midnight on the first day and ending
at midnight 7 days later. In response to APA's recommendation that the definition of calendar day specify that the
local time be that of the flight attendant's home base, the FAA has determined that any time zone can be used to determine
whether the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement is met, as long as the carrier is consistent. In other words, a certificate
holder may not manipulate the use of time zones when calculating 7 consecutive calendar days so as to vary the number
of hours that comprise any 7 consecutive calendar days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has considered the commenters' request to replace the proposed 7 consecutive calendar days with a 168-consecutive-hour
period. The FAA notes that the NPRM used language consistent with the language contained in the current flight crewmember
flight time limitations rule. The FAA has decided that it should not introduce at this final rule stage an inconsistency
between the flight crewmember flight time limitations rule language and the flight attendant duty period limitations
and rest requirements rule language. The FAA will consider whether rulemaking should be initiated to replace 7 consecutive
calendar days with 168-consecutive-hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed requests to permit flight attendants to voluntarily waive the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement.
The FAA has not included that alternative in this final rule because the purpose of requiring 24 consecutive hours
free from duty in any 7 consecutive calendar days is to ensure that flight attendants receive the opportunity to obtain
adequate rest. As with rest requirements following reduced rest, the requirement for 24 consecutive hours of rest
in any 7 consecutive calendar days is designed to protect flight attendants by minimizing the effects of cumulative
fatigue.

In response to comments received from ATA and Delta Airlines, the FAA has determined that it is not necessary to include
in this final rule provisions for permitting the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement to be delayed. This final rule
imposes restrictions for flight attendants that parallel the restrictions that currently exist for flight crewmembers.
The absence of provisions to permit the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement to be delayed does not preclude a flight
attendant from completing a duty period assignment that has extended into the seventh calendar day because of a delay
that is beyond the control of the operator. In addition, the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement may be delayed for
reasons such as deadheading, assignment to training, and others. However, if the requirement is delayed, the flight
attendant must be given the 24-consecutive-hour rest period before beginning any subsequent duty period assignment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to unscheduled operators, the FAA notes that unscheduled part 135 operators conducting operations that
require flight attendants have the option to apply the flight crewmember flight time limitations to flight attendants
instead of using the duty period limitations and rest requirements contained in this final rule. Sections 135.267(f)
and 135.269(d) require certificate holders to provide each flight crewmember with at least 13 rest periods of at least
24 consecutive hours each in each calendar quarter. Among other requirements, operators that choose to apply flight
crewmember requirements to flight attendants would be required to provide flight attendants with at least 13 rest
periods of at least 24 consecutive hours in each calendar quarter instead of relief from duty for 24 consecutive hours
every 7 consecutive calendar days.

Although there was no specific proposal in the notice, the FAA requested comments on the feasibility of establishing

In response to the comments submitted, the FAA will not mandate compensatory rest periods in this final rule. The FAA
has determined that compensatory rest is not necessary, because the duty period limitations and rest requirements

safety duties.

Reserve Status, Stand-by Status, or Similar Assignments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA recognizes that current industry practice varies with regard to the use of these terms and their relationship
to duty or rest. In the NPRM, the FAA requested comments on the most appropriate way to address reserve status, stand-by
status, or a similar assignment. The FAA received 13 comments, primarily from air carrier associations and labor
organizations. Commenters described different types of reserve status and suggested situations when reserve should
be considered duty or rest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA recommended adding the following phrase to the definition of rest period: ``except that reserve status assignments
shall be considered `rest' for purposes of this rule, provided that the only work-related restriction shall be to
report for a flight assignment within a specified period of time pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or
company work rules.'' The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions recommended that the definition of rest period be
revised to ``the time period free of all restraint or duty from a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial
operator and free of all responsibility, or interruption by, work or duty.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, commenters indicated that different types of reserve status including ``call-in'' reserve and ``on-call''
reserve are commonly found in the aviation industry. As described by commenters, call-in reserve requires that a
flight attendant contact, or be available to be contacted by, the operator at designated times for flight assignments.
The commenters added that on-call reserve typically requires that a flight attendant be available for an assignment
on short notice (usually within 1 hour) if contacted by the operator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A majority of the commenters on this issue discussed whether reserve status should be considered rest. ATA, NACA,
and Southwest Airlines stated that the time a flight attendant is assigned to reserve status and is not assigned to
a duty period should be considered rest for the purpose of meeting the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement proposed
in &sect;121.466(n) of the NPRM. RAA stated that the type of reserve in which a person must contact the company for future
assignments_rather than being available for an assignment on short notice_should be considered rest because it
is free of all duty except for the possibility of communication with the operators. Two individual commenters stated
that the time a flight attendant spends on reserve should not be considered rest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four of the commenters, including ATA, Delta Air Lines, and RAA, commented on whether reserve status should be considered
part of a duty period. ATA and Delta Air Lines stated that the time a flight attendant spends on reserve should not be
considered a duty period. ATA noted that, if reserve is considered duty, operators will need to increase staff by 20
to 30 percent. ATA estimates that the annual cost would be $100 to $130 million for salaries, benefits, and associated
training and administrative costs. Delta Air Lines expressed concern that if ``on-call'' reserve is considered
duty, flight attendants would request at-home pay. RAA stated that the type of reserve in which a person is expected
to report on short notice should be considered duty. TWU Local 556 stated that duty time for a reserve flight attendant
should be calculated from actual report time to release time for a flight assignment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the commenters who stated that reserve status should be considered rest, the FAA notes that the time
during which a flight attendant is responsible for contacting a certificate holder or for being available to be contacted
by a certificate holder for an assignment (e.g., reserve or stand-by status) does not meet any rest period requirements,
because the FAA has defined a rest period as free of all restraint or duty and free of all responsibility for work or duty
should the occasion arise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically in response to ATA's, NACA's, and Southwest Airlines' suggestions that reserve assignments should
fulfill the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement if no duty period is assigned, the FAA reiterates that rest period
requirements are not met when a flight attendant is assigned to reserve status even if the flight attendant is not given
a duty period assignment. A duty period, as defined in this final rule, does not begin until a flight attendant reports
for an assignment involving flight time. For example, a flight attendant who has been assigned to reserve status for
24 hours but has not reported for a duty period assignment during that time will not have satisfied the 24-hour-in-7-day
rest requirement. The rest requirement is not satisfied, because the reserve assignment is a restraint and includes
present responsibility for work as a flight attendant if the occasion arises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that reserve status should not be restricted by duty period requirements. The FAA refers the
commenters to the definition of duty period in &sect;&sect;121.467(a) and 135.273(a) of the final rule, the first
sentence of which reads: ``Duty period means the period of elapsed time between reporting for an assignment involving
flight time and release from that assignment. *&blank;*&blank;*'' It should be clear that reserve status alone does
not meet the definition of duty period. On the other hand, it also should be clear that reserve status may not be performed
during a rest period. The definition of rest period in &sect;&sect;121.467(a) and 135.273(a) of the final rule states
that ``Rest period means the time period free of all restraint or duty for a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier
or commercial operator and free of all responsibility for work or duty should the occasion arise.''

Augmented Cabin Crews

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule permits operators to schedule flight attendants for duty periods of more than 14 hours provided an
operator: (1) Assigns flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement required for the
flight or flights in that duty period under the certificate holder's operations specifications; and (2) schedules
an extended rest period following the duty period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ten commenters submitted comments on the proposed augmented cabin crew requirements addressing: (1) The concept
of augmenting cabin crews in proportion to the type of aircraft; (2) the relationship between augmented cabin crews
and flight attendant fatigue; and (3) the effect of augmented crew requirements on unscheduled operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APA, NAA, and RAA noted that the proposed augmented cabin crew requirements are not based on the size of the aircraft.
APA stated that if the FAA intends the provision for augmented cabin crews to be used only for long-range operations,
this should be clarified in the final rule. APA noted that, under the proposed provisions, one flight attendant would
be added to either a two-person crew or an eight-person crew. NAA noted that, one additional flight attendant on a Boeing
757 is a 20 percent increase in crew; one additional flight attendant on a wide-body airplane is a 7 percent increase
in crew. NAA recommended that the FAA distinguish between wide-body and narrow-body airplanes by requiring one additional
flight attendant for any duty period between 14 and 20 hours on a narrow-body airplane. RAA stated that operators of
airplanes that require one or two flight attendants should not be required to augment cabin crews in order to schedule
duty periods longer than 14 hours. RAA added that a passenger seat will be needed for an additional flight attendant.
RAA also noted that regional operators schedule some duty periods longer than 14 hours; however, many of these include
an intermediate rest period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, and RAA addressed the relationship between augmented cabin crews
and fatigue. APA and the Coalition stated that a larger crew does not necessarily result in a less fatigued crew and
noted that American Airlines, Trans World Airlines, United Air Lines, and USAir currently assign flight attendants
in addition to the minimum crew complement. APA and the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions noted that the proposal
does not require an operator to provide a flight attendant with inflight rest. RAA stated that requiring augmented
cabin crews for the purpose of reducing fatigue has been inadequately justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA and Delta Air Lines stated that the rule should permit a flight to operate if an augmented crew is assigned but not
present for a flight because of unforeseen circumstances (e.g., illness or injury during a layover). Delta suggested
that 1 hour of on-board crew rest for the remaining flight attendant crew could be provided in this circumstance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AMR Combs noted that a change is needed for on-demand operators. They stated that a ``larger'' aircraft such as a Gulfstream
or a Challenger cannot accommodate up to four flight attendants. AMR Combs stated that these operators would either
apply for an exemption or not use a flight attendant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provision for augmented cabin crews is designed to reduce fatigue by decreasing flight attendant work load on
a flight and by providing an extended rest period following a long duty day. Although the FAA recognizes that the provision
will not require flight attendant crews to be augmented proportionally for each aircraft type, it provides the least
complicated method for reducing fatigue and accommodating certain operational requirements. Therefore, in this
final rule, the FAA adopts the provision for augmenting cabin crews on a flight or flights with a scheduled duty period
of more than 14 hours but not more than 18 hours, and scheduled duty periods that do not exceed 20 hours for duty periods
that contain one or more flights that land or take off outside the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments from AMR Combs, Delta Airlines, and RAA, this final rule contains no provision to except an
operator from meeting minimum augmented cabin crew requirements when a flight attendant duty period is scheduled
for more than 14 hours in operations that require a flight attendant. This includes instances in which a required crewmember
is not available following a layover, e.g., due to illness or injury. Additionally, the use of an approved passenger
seat is required for operators that schedule flight attendants for duty periods of more than 14 hours on aircraft that
are not configured with a flight attendant jumpseat for the additional flight attendant(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to AMR Combs' comment regarding the use of flight attendants in Gulfstream and Challenger aircraft, this
final rule applies to operations that require a flight attendant. Typically, Gulfstream and Challenger aircraft
are not configured with more than 19 passenger seats and a flight attendant is not required to be on board. Therefore,
flight attendants assigned to such operations are not subject to the duty period limitations and rest requirements
in this final rule. In addition, operators have the option to apply flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements
to flight attendants.

Proposed &sect;&sect;121.466(m) and 135.273(m) described deadhead transportation as time spent in transportation,
not local in character, that a certificate holder requires of a flight attendant and provides to transport the flight
attendant to an airport at which that flight attendant is to serve on a flight as a crewmember, or from an airport at which
the flight attendant was relieved from duty to return to the flight attendant's home base. Under the proposal, time
spent in deadhead transportation is not rest.

ATA, Delta Air Lines, and NACA requested that the final rule provide scheduling flexibility for flight attendants
in deadhead transportation. ATA requested that the FAA permit: (1) Operators to schedule 2 hours of deadhead transportation
to a domicile that is not counted within duty time limitations; (2) flight attendants to waive all duty time limitations
when returning to a domicile and count the time as rest; and (3) flight attendants to delay the weekly rest requirement
to return to the flight attendant's home base. Delta Air Lines stated that the FAA should permit a flight attendant
to alter schedules to exceed the scheduled maximum duty time after the last flight segment to return to the flight attendant's
home base. Delta also recommended that an operator be permitted to deadhead a flight attendant for up to 20 hours regardless
of the number of assigned flight attendants. NACA suggested that the final rule clarify that the time a flight attendant
spends deadheading is not limited by duty periods or the requirement to augment the flight attendant crew because
no inflight duties are involved.

ATA and NACA stated that the final rule should clarify that a deadheading flight attendant is not a working member of
the cabin crew for the purpose of determining if staffing requirements must be augmented.

Deadhead transportation as adopted in &sect;&sect;121.467(b)(12) and 135.273(b)(12) of this final rule is not
considered part of a rest period. This use of deadhead transportation in relation to flight attendant duty period
limitations and rest requirements is consistent with the application of flight crewmember flight time limitations
and rest requirements.

In addition, a flight attendant scheduled for deadhead transportation is not assigned to duty in an aircraft and is
not considered a working crewmember. Therefore, for the purpose of determining duty period limitations and rest
requirements, deadhead transportation is not considered an assignment involving flight time and is not part of a
duty period. In response to the comments submitted, the FAA reiterates that an operator is not required to augment
flight attendant crews for flights when a flight attendant is assigned to deadhead transportation because the time
spent in deadhead transportation is not part of a duty period. For example, an operator may schedule a flight attendant
crew for a flight to Europe with a duty period of 14 hours. Immediately following the flight and before beginning a 9-hour
rest period, the operator requires the flight attendant crew to deadhead for 2 hours to position the crew for the next
duty period assignment. In this example, the operator is not required to augment the flight attendant crew because
the deadheading portion of the assignment is not considered part of the duty period. However, the 2 hours spent positioning
the crew for the next assignment are not considered part of the 9-hour rest period.

The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions included in its alternative the provision for a flight attendant to refuse
a work assignment that does not meet the Coalition's proposed duty time limitations and rest requirements. In contrast,
TWU Local 556, representing the flight attendants of Southwest Airlines, commented that the provision of flight
attendant responsibility could place a flight attendant in the impossible position of risking either a fine from
the FAA or discipline for insubordination from the airline if the carrier's scheduling department makes a mistake.

FAA Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of comments received, the FAA has determined that only an operator, not a flight attendant, should be responsible
for ensuring that duty limitations and rest requirements are met. The FAA bases its decision on the fact that a flight
attendant could be called upon to decide between the violation of a regulation and possible disciplinary action from
the company. That misunderstanding and conflict between company scheduling personnel and flight attendants could
occur at a time when flight attendants should be giving their full attention to the passengers. In cases in which a flight
attendant is aware that an assignment does not meet duty period and rest requirements, the FAA recommends that the
flight attendant bring the situation to the air carrier's attention. If the situation is not corrected, the flight
attendant should then inform the FAA. However, this recommendation does not preclude a flight attendant from informing
the FAA before contacting the air carrier. In addition, flight attendant duty and rest time records are subject to
FAA review. Air carriers found to be in noncompliance with the regulation are subject to enforcement action.

Recordkeeping
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 121.683(a)(1) and 135.63(a)(5) of the NPRM proposed requiring certificate holders to maintain current
records on flight attendant duty and rest time requirements. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, Southwest
Airlines, TWU Local 556, and TWU of America agree with the proposed recordkeeping requirements. The Coalition of
Flight Attendant Unions does not anticipate that the recordkeeping requirements as proposed in the NPRM would be
unduly burdensome.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAA stated that the cost of tracking crew time for duty and rest could be very expensive. NAA noted that many small carriers
do not have expensive computer tracking systems and cannot afford to do manual tracking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta Airlines stated that the one-time cost for computer software changes would be $368,000. NACA noted that one
of its members estimates that the proposed recordkeeping requirements would cost $50,000 annually.

FAA Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information and recordkeeping requirements of this final rule are currently under review by the Office of Management
and Budget. Provided that they are approved by OMB, the FAA adopts the recordkeeping requirements as proposed in the
NPRM. These requirements will become effective when they have been approved by OMB. The FAA anticipates that this
approval will be given soon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that a concern of the aviation industry has been the potential cost involved in tracking crew time
for duty and rest periods. The regulation provides that carriers maintain current records for each flight attendant
to verify compliance with flight, duty, and rest time periods. The FAA intends to be as flexible as possible in interpreting
this recordkeeping requirement. Records may be maintained by computer, by hand documentation, or by any other method
that will permit a carrier to assure compliance with the regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since many carriers already track flight attendant duty periods to ensure that union contract or company guidelines
on duty and rest time are met, the FAA expects that recordkeeping systems already in place will be sufficient to meet
the recordkeeping requirements of the final rule with minimal modification. Carriers that do not currently track
flight attendant duty periods will incur costs in developing recordkeeping systems; however, the flexibility built
into the final rule should help to minimize these costs. Further, the FAA intends to assist these carriers by providing
information and guidance based on already-implemented recordkeeping systems maintained by other air carriers.

Implementation Time of the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATA and Delta Air Lines requested that the FAA not implement this final rule immediately. They noted that operators
will need time to revise their computer programs. ATA requested a 12-month implementation period; Delta requested
an 18-month implementation period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
FAA Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has considered the implementation periods proposed by ATA and Delta. However, in the interest of public safety,
the FAA has determined that the final compliance date of this rule should be no later than March 1, 1995. Because most
operators are currently using scheduling guidelines and tracking systems for flight attendants, the FAA has determined
that the March 1, 1995, date is reasonable.

Commenters who addressed flight attendant fatigue include ATA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, NACA,
NTSB, RAA, SCA, and Southwest Airlines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA emphasized that flight attendant fatigue caused by abusive scheduling or duty periods is not a problem in the scheduled
airline industry. NACA, RAA, SCA, and Southwest Airlines emphasized that studies have found no correlation between
flight attendant fatigue and the ability of a flight attendant to perform safety-sensitive functions. SCA point
out that accident data do not specify flight attendant fatigue as a factor in delay of evacuation or in injuries or fatalities
that occurred.

The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions provided a summary of research on circadian dysrhythmia and fatigue with
an extensive bibliography. NTSB reiterated Recommendation I&hyph;89&hyph;1, which stated that the Department
of Transportation should ``expedite a coordinated research program on the effects of fatigue, sleepiness, sleep

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has reviewed the extensive amounts of literature provided by commenters on fatigue related to travel and extended
work periods as well as to shift work. Although consideration has been given to numerous fatigue studies, no accident/incident
data is available to provide a direct correlation between flight attendant fatigue and passenger safety. However,
it is evident that fatigue may affect flight attendant performance and that proper scheduling practices may help
avoid compromising flight attendant performance. The FAA recognizes that flight attendants perform essential
safety duties and has determined that the requirements contained in this final rule enhance safety by protecting
flight attendants from acute and chronic fatigue. This final rule addresses the potential safety problems that could
occur if fatigued flight attendants work excessive duty hours or receive inadequate rest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The principal commenters who addressed the Industry Study include AMR Combs, American Cyanamid Company, the Coalition
of Flight Attendant Unions, and SCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Cyanamid Company stated that the Industry Study does not indicate that there is a pattern of air carriers
willfully scheduling long duty days or long series of days without a day off. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions
indicated that the Industry Study has been used as evidence that extreme examples of scheduling abuse are isolated
and that the actual occurrences of scheduling abuse were most likely under-reported because the instances provided
in the Industry Study were ``self-selected.'' The Coalition further stated that, even though the instances were
self-selected, the Industry Study found industry-wide flight attendant duty and rest period problems. SCA stated
that the Industry Study does not provide evidence to establish any correlation among flight attendant duty time,
flight attendant safety duties, and risk to passengers. AMR Combs and American Cyanamid Company noted that the Industry
Study did not consider unscheduled part 135 operators.

FAA Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA conducted the Industry Study to determine if scheduling extremes exist, and, if so, to determine the nature
of the extremes, not to determine the statistical frequency with which they occur or to correlate passenger risk with
extreme scheduling. Access to records was gained through the cooperation of air carriers. The air carriers did not
choose individual records for examination. Based on the purpose of the study, records were selected for review when
flight attendant scheduling extremes were expected to be likely. Therefore, statistical inferences cannot be made.
However, the data contained in the Industry Study provides fundamental background information on flight attendant
scheduling practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Industry Study included a review of data from major, national, regional, and supplemental carriers. The study
did not include a review of unscheduled part 135 operators because relatively few of these operators conduct operations
that require a flight attendant. As previously discussed, air carriers and commercial operators conducting operations
for which the FAA does not require a flight attendant will not be required to comply with flight attendant duty period
limitations and rest requirements even if flight attendants are involved in those operations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment did not make a distinction between domestic and international operations in determining
flight attendant duty limitations and rest requirements. Five commenters commented on whether there should be a
distinction between domestic and international operations for determining flight attendant duty period limitations
and rest requirements. Four commenters, including the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions and the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM &amp; AW), supported making a distinction. The Coalition provided
definitions for a domestic flight, an international flight, and a long-range international flight. One commenter
stated that flight attendants assigned to international flight require more rest than flight attendants assigned
to domestic flights because flight attendants on international flights are in a state of physical desynchronization.
Another commenter stated that duty period limits should be 12 hours for domestic flights and 14 hours for international
flights. NAA stated that no distinction should be made between international and domestic flights because some domestic
flights are as long as international flights and the work load is the same for the crew.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a review of the Coalition comments and an analysis of flight schedules, the FAA finds that scheduled duty periods
for operations wholly within the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia should not be allowed to exceed
18 hours. The FAA is not aware of any scheduled duty periods for these operations that currently do exceed 18 hours.
However, for duty periods involving one or more flights that land or take off outside the 48 contiguous states and the
District of Columbia, the duty period may not exceed 20 hours. Thus, the final rule makes this distinction between
domestic and international operations.

Section 125.37, Duty time limitations, currently requires a flight crewmember to be relieved from duty for at least

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the Industry Study, the FAA conducted a review of the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO)
regulations relating to flight attendant flight, duty, and rest times including a review of ICAO Circular Flight
Crew Fatigue and Flight Time Limitations (52&hyph;AN/47/6). The Industry Study identified 23 countries that have
government regulations for flight attendant flight and duty limitations and rest requirements, and 24 countries
that do not have such regulations. The FAA notes that the Joint Aviation Regulations currently do not include flight
time limitations for flight attendants; however, the JAA have proposed flight time limitations for flight crewmembers
and flight attendants that are currently under review by the European Community. Based on this information, the FAA
has determined that flight attendant flight and duty limitations and rest requirements of some countries are less
stringent than the final rule adopted by the FAA, and the requirements of other countries are more stringent than those
being adopted. Therefore, the FAA considers the final rule to be within the range of worldwide governmental regulations
governing flight attendant duty limitations and rest requirements.

Changes to the NPRM
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA amended several provisions of the proposed rule in response to comments received from the public. Any changes
that significantly altered the requirements of the duty period limitations and rest requirements are discussed
previously and are summarized in this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM made no distinction between domestic and international operations. In the final rule domestic operations
are limited to up to 18-hour scheduled duty periods. However, scheduled duty periods that involve one or more flights
that land or take off outside the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia may be scheduled up to 20 hours, providing
required augmentation is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA moved flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements from proposed &sect;121.466 in the
NPRM to &sect;121.467 in the final rule to facilitate the incorporation of future amendments. In addition, paragraphs
describing duty period and rest period provisions in the NPRM have been revised and renumbered in the final rule to
incorporate new and revised requirements. The FAA also revised the NPRM to include minor editorial changes and revised
the list of subjects to include additional terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on comments receive, the FAA removed the proposed requirement that a flight attendant be responsible for ensuring
compliance with duty period limitations and rest requirements before accepting any flight assignments. The FAA
determined that this is an operator's responsibility and not the responsibility of a flight attendant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM included the proposal that an operator may not assign a flight attendant a duty period of 14 or more hours following
a 10-hour reduced rest period. In &sect;&sect;121.467(b)(9) and 135.273(b)(9), the FAA revised the NPRM to restrict
an operator from assigning a flight attendant to a duty period of ``more than 14 hours'' following a 10-hour reduced
rest period. This change permits an operator to assign a flight attendant to a duty period of up to and including 14 hours
following the reduced rest period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA incorporated provisions into the final rule to give operators the option to apply the flight crewmember flight,
duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants. The FAA permits this option provided that the operator establishes
written procedures that are referenced in the certificate holder's operations specifications for applying the
appropriate flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In the NPRM, the FAA requested additional information on the costs of the proposed rule. The FAA received comments
from associations, labor organizations, and part 121 operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA, which primarily represents part 121 scheduled operators, stated that the proposal would cost its members at
least $8 million annually to revise current computer crew scheduling programs, hire additional personnel, extend
layovers, and schedule reserves. ATA believes that the costs were understated in the NPRM and noted that they did not
include an inflation factor. ATA indicated that the 15-year cost of the proposed rule would be $88,947,099 using a
7-percent discount rate and a 3-percent inflation rate. RAA stated that the costs associated with the proposed rule
are significantly understated. In addition, RAA believes that the economic effect of the proposed rule should reflect
the cost burden of other recent rulemakings. NACA stated that the proposal would cost one of its members an estimated
$372,000 annually for additional staffing and $50,000 annually to meet recordkeeping requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions stated that the median flight attendant salary, based on the average salary
for supplemental air carrier flight attendants represented by the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), is $18,461.
According to the Coalition, if 6,000 flight attendants are hired by supplemental operators, the cost in salaries
will be $1,107,660 [sic]. The Coalition noted that this is one tenth the cost of random drug testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta Airlines, a scheduled part 121 operator, indicated that the initial cost to comply with the proposed rule would
be $2,863,416. This cost includes the cost of hiring 36 additional flight attendants, estimated at $1,348,000; paying
flight attendants during deplaning, estimated at $749,000; providing additional meals, estimated at $400,000;
and modifying computer software, estimated to be a one-time cost of $367,000. Delta estimates that the annual cost
to comply with the proposed rule would be $2.5 million.

Sun Country Airlines, an unscheduled part 121 operator, stated that it would be required to augment cabin crews on
domestic flights more often than it now does. Sun Country Airlines also stated that, if the NPRM had been effective
in 1992, the carrier would have hired an additional 34 flight attendants and the cost to domestic operations would
have been $2.6 million in salaries, benefits, training, hotels, meals, deadhead travel, and administrative burden.
Sun Country Airlines pointed out that the NPRM estimated that supplemental operators would absorb 60 percent of the
proposal's costs while supplemental operators employ only 1 percent of all flight attendants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Great American Airways, an unscheduled part 121 operator, stated that the proposed rule would impose substantially
greater costs on supplemental air carriers. Positioning flight attendants would become a major expense for supplemental
operators. Unanticipated schedule and routing changes could severely curtail current flexibility. However, Great
American Airways stated that the disruptions mentioned above would be minimized if supplemental air carriers had
the option to apply the same work rules to both flight attendants and pilots. Great American Airways estimates that
the total cost savings that would be derived from implementing a single set of duty limitations for its cabin and flight
crewmembers, as opposed to adopting the requirements proposed in the NPRM, would be more than $100,000 annually.

Information collection requirements for parts 121, 125, and 135 have been previously approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) and have been assigned
OMB Control Numbers as follows: For part 121, OMB Control Number 2120&hyph;0008; for part 125, OMB Control Number
2120&hyph;0085; and for part 135, OMB Control Number 2120&hyph;0039. The FAA has prepared changes to these control
numbers to reflect the additional paperwork requirements of this final rule and has submitted these changes to OMB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In completing this rulemaking, the FAA has been mindful that it is the policy of the agency and the Administration to
avoid imposing unnecessary paperwork burdens on industry. To that end, the FAA has carefully considered all comments
on recordkeeping and has made every attempt to minimize the paperwork burden for carriers. For example, allowing
carriers to employ a single scheduling system for entire crews_pilots and flight attendants_will enable them to
avoid maintaining two separate duty schedules. Indeed, for many carriers, the FAA believes the final rule will create
little or no net additional paperwork.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA expects the final rule to help ensure that flight attendants are rested and alert when performing emergency
and routine safety related duties and thereby reduce injuries and fatalities in air carrier accidents. However,
as in the NPRM, the FAA has not quantified the benefits associated with this rulemaking because there is a lack of accident/incident
data that can be used to directly correlate flight attendant fatigue with passenger fatalities and injuries. Instead,
the FAA has examined the potential benefits of this rulemaking from a qualitative perspective.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA received comments both supporting and opposing the correlation between flight attendant duty period limitations
and rest requirements and passenger safety. One commenter stated that fatigue increases during the work period,
and duty times that exceed 12 hours for domestic flights and 14 hours for international flights can be expected to potentially
derogate safety performance. Another commenter stated that the FAA has provided no sufficient foundation for concluding
that the absence of the proposed regulations constitutes a derogation of aviation safety, and that the absence of
any experience in which a flight safety problem was attributable to undue flight attendant fatigue is a strong argument
that no such problem exists.

The FAA agrees with commenters who stated that inadequate rest or excessive duty periods could derogate safety. However,
the commenters did not define acceptable or unacceptable levels of risk, and did not provide any justification for
the distinction. Because quantifiable data was not available, the FAA was unable to calculate the quantitative benefits
of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that inadequate rest periods for flight attendants could create a potential safety problem. Therefore,
the FAA expects that this final rule will ensure that flight attendants receive the opportunity to be rested and alert
when performing emergency and routine safety-related duties, thereby reducing passenger and crew injuries and
fatalities.

The Coalition stated that, in addition to improving the safety of air travel, the regulatory evaluation should take
into account the cost savings from improved worker productivity. That commenter also stated that a careful review
of various studies would likely reveal that the benefits of more reasonable duty hours and adequate rest include decreased
absenteeism and health problems related to fatigue. The Allied Pilot Association stated that ``the welfare of regulated
employees ought to be one of the concerns of rulemakers.''

Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cost estimates contained in this summary are based on 1993 dollars and are discounted at an annual effective rate of
7 percent. The FAA estimates that the cost to the air carrier industry of establishing flight attendant duty period
limitations and rest requirements will be $42.7 million over a 15-year period. The FAA expects that operators would
incur costs in the areas of recordkeeping and additional staffing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost estimates for supplemental air carriers and scheduled major, national, and regional/commuter operators are
separated. The FAA estimates that the nondiscounted cost for all supplemental air carriers for the first year will
be approximately $2.5 million, and the annual nondiscounted cost for all supplemental carriers would be approximately
$2.23 million. The FAA estimates that the total discounted costs for supplemental air carriers over 15 years will
be approximately $20.8 million. The FAA estimates that the first-year nondiscounted cost for scheduled major, national,
and regional/commuter operators will be approximately $2.9 million, and the annual nondiscounted cost for these
operators would be approximately $1.2 million. The FAA estimates that the total discounted costs for scheduled major,
national, and regional/commuter over 15 years will be approximately $21.9 million. Therefore, over 15 years, the
discounted cost for the air carrier industry will be $42.7 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above cost estimate is based on the assumption that air carriers must augment their flight attendant crews. In
some situations, augmentation under the flight attendant rule requirements may be avoided if an air carrier adopts
and applies to flight attendants, by option, the international, supplemental carrier pilot rules covering flight
and duty period.

Twenty-Four Consecutive-Hour Rest Period During any Seven Consecutive Days
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Southwest Airlines stated that the requirement for 24 consecutive hours of rest during any 7 consecutive days would
make it necessary for the air carrier with which the commenter is affiliated to hire about 100 additional flight attendants
at a first-year cost of $710,000 and a subsequent annual cost of $600,000. A commenter representing Transport Workers
Union of America on behalf of Southwest Airlines flight attendants indicated that the proposed rule, if adopted,
would create a financial burden for flight attendants and their employers and would result in an average annual loss
of $11,063 in extra income for each flight attendant. This loss, projected for 2,200 flight attendants for 1 year,
would total $24 million in lost income.

The requirement for 24 consecutive hours of rest in any 7 consecutive days is designed to supplement daily rest requirements
and to ensure that flight attendants receive the opportunity for adequate rest. The FAA did not verify lost flight
attendant income, because the annual loss of extra income to some flight attendants represents a gain to flight attendants
who would be hired. This income transfer is not considered a cost of this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Great American Airways stated that the total cost savings derived from implementing a single set of duty time rules
for its cabin and flight crewmembers, as opposed to adopting the rules proposed in the NPRM, would exceed $100,000
per year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA recognizes that giving operators the option to apply flight crewmember flights, duty, and rest requirements
to flight attendants may provide a cost savings to certain operators, particularly supplemental operators. The
FAA expects that the operators that choose the option will incur costs that are lower than those estimated in the final
regulatory evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the FAA recognizes that operators who choose to apply the flight crewmember regulations for duty limitations
and rest requirements must submit an application to the appropriate Flight Standards District Office for approval.
This is a minor, one-time cost, and the FAA assumes that operators who choose to incur this cost would do so because it
would obviate those operators from designing and establishing a tracking system for flight attendants. Instead,
this option would allow them to use whatever system is in place for flight crewmembers. The application process chosen
was selected deliberately out of concern that recordkeeping costs be kept to a minimum. That is, the FAA chose an application
process that is very familiar to carriers, the commonly-used procedure for changes to operations specifications.

Limiting Scheduled Duty Period to Fourteen Hours
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Great American Airways stated that limiting scheduled flight attendant duty periods to 14 hours would force the air
carrier and other supplemental air carriers to add flight attendants at intermediate stops. The commenter stated
that, because company-required deadhead transportation would be considered part of a duty period under the FAA's
proposal, it would be necessary to schedule flight attendants for required rest after they completed a deadhead flight
segment and before they began the next duty period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter also stated that the proposed rules would impose substantially greater costs on supplemental air
carriers than other air carriers because supplemental air carriers rarely have travel privileges with scheduled
carriers, and, when they do, they are often very restrictive. Finally, this commenter stated that unanticipated
schedule and routing changes occur more frequently among charter operators than scheduled carriers and could severely
curtail the flexibility of supplemental air carriers.

The FAA agrees that the greatest costs will be incurred by air carriers that schedule flight attendants for the longest
duty periods. However, the commenter does not appear to provide any information on the air carrier's ability to augment
existing crews. The FAA points out that costs could be minimized by using crew argumentation as a means of compliance.
In addition, time spent in deadhead transportation is not considered part of a duty period; therefore, an operator
is not required to provide a rest period for flight attendants following time spent in deadhead transportation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATA stated that the FAA has understated costs considerably. This commenter stated that the annual cost of complying
with the proposed regulation would be at least $8.0 million. This cost would include programming expenses, additional
personnel costs, costs associated with extended layovers, and costs associated with reserve scheduling (assuming
that carrier reserve scheduling practices are not modified). Assuming a discount rate of 7.0 percent and an inflation
rate of 3.0 percent, the 15-year present value cost for the association's members would be approximately $88.9 million.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The survey of ATA members indicates that the annual cost would be at least $8.0 million. ATA stated that added annual
personnel costs for air carrier operators would be $4.0 million, additional meal/hotel expenses would be $1.5 million,
and additional reserve staffing would be $2.5 million. Finally, ATA stated that carriers can expect to incur a one-time
expense of between $2.0 million and $3.0 million for computer system program modifications. After contracting ATA
twice after the comment period closed to obtain clarifying information, the FAA concluded that their estimate could
not be used in its entirety because information such as the number of affected carriers, wage rates, additional employees
needed, or hours worked was not provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, ATA did not provide information on the cost of augmenting the existing crew. The FAA permits longer duty
periods with the use of augmented crews. FAA data indicates that many flights are staffed with more than the minimum
flight attendant crew complement; therefore, little or no additional cost would be incurred to meet the crew argumentation
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA also stated that the 15-year present value cost for its members would be $88.9 million. This estimate assumed a
discount rate of 7.0 percent and an inflation rate of 3.0 percent. The basis for the commenter's estimate of the annual
cost ($8.0 million) was not detailed enough for the FAA to use it or the 15-year estimate derived from it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has nevertheless attempted to develop an industry cost estimate by recalculating the ATA estimate to exclude
the ATA inflation factor and by accounting for the fact that ATA members only represent a portion of the industry that
would be affected. As shown in the Regulatory Evaluation, that figure would be $78.8 million. However, the original
information provided could not be fully substantiated, which suggests that the ATA estimate may not be representative
of the total industry.

The Coalition stated that the median flight attendant salary at supplemental air carriers is $18,461. The commenter
indicated that this estimate may be high because it represents the average salary at supplemental carriers that have
a collective bargaining agreement with their flight attendant workforce. The commenter also stated that the FAA
assumed that the rule would lead to the hiring of 6,000 flight attendants at supplemental carriers, and that the additional
cost for these new hires would be $1,107,600. The FAA received revised salary information from the commenter stating
that the average salary of a flight attendant working for a supplemental carrier is $24,552, which includes $6,092
in benefits.

The final regulatory evaluation assumes that, in the case of supplemental operators, each flight attendant works
150 duty periods, and that a carrier's cost per duty period is $163.68. Therefore, the cost of 6,000 additional duty
periods would be $982,100. To the extent practicable, this cost estimate for supplemental operations was used in
developing the final regulatory evaluation.

Irregular Operations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Delta Air Lines stated that the proposed rule would cause the air carrier to incur costs associated with irregular
operations. The air carrier estimated that it would have to hire 36 flight attendants at an annual salary cost of $1.3
million for irregular operations. Other costs associated with hiring additional flight attendants to meet the requirements
of the proposed rule, if adopted, would total $2.86 million in the initial year. The recurring annual cost of the proposed
rule, if adopted, would be nearly $2.5 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter stated that, based on operations in June/July 1992 and January/February 1993, 62 flight attendants
working together did not meet the requirements of the NPRM and would require crew replacement. The commenter typically
schedules flight attendants for 3-day city pairings with an average flight attendant crew of six. Because most of
the replacements that were needed were on domestic flights, the commenter used an average of four flight attendants.
These results showed that 744 additional duty days would be required. The commenter calculated that an additional
36 flight attendants would be needed because a reserve flight attendant is available to fly an average of 20.5 days
per month. Given an average monthly salary of almost $2,500, plus monthly hotel, meal, and transportation expenses
of almost $650 for irregular operations, the cost for a flight attendant would be about $3,100 per month, or $1.3 million
annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also stated that they do not have a deplaning period. That is, pay and expenses cease at the block-in time
of the last flight in the duty period for the trip. This commenter calculates that the cost of a 15-minute deplaning
period would result in the hiring of 20 additional flight attendants. The cost would amount to $749,000 annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the commenter provided information documenting the carrier's one-time cost of computer software changes,
including recordkeeping. The only additional information is that the cost of programming and testing per man-hour
is $40.

The FAA received clarification from the commenter stating that ``An Ad Hoc Computer Program was developed to search
through our crew tracking systems to identify irregular operations that had occurred that would have required crew
replacement under the NPRM.'' The commenter also stated that the NPRM ``Would require crew replacement.'' Finally,
the commenter stated that they used an average crew of four flight attendants in their calculations, which implies
that they were replacing their existing crew. This leads the FAA to assume that the commenter did not consider crew
augmentation. However, the FAA did use some of the salary and cost data provided by the commenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to hiring additional flight attendants for a 15-minute deplaning period, the FAA notes that there is no
new requirement in this rule concerning deplaning; deplaning of the aircraft is a current requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sun Country Airlines operates a fleet of 10 aircraft with 520 employees, 170 of whom are flight attendants. Based on
1992 operations, the proposed rule would have required the commenter to hire 34 additional flight attendants, which
would have increased operating costs (i.e., salaries, benefits, costs of training, hotels, meals, deadhead travel,
and general administrative overhead) by $2.6 million in 1992. However, this air carrier stated that, by applying
crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants, the air carrier would need to employ 20 additional
flight attendants rather than 34 additional flight attendants, with increased operating costs of $1.75 million
rather than $2.6 million. However, these lower costs still exceeded the entire 1992 new profit for this carrier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Airline Association stated that the proposed rule would either require an additional jump seat in the
cabin for which there is insufficient space or it would require that a passenger seat be set aside for the additional
flight attendant. This commenter stated that daily or routine loss of a revenue seat on a fleet of regional aircraft
with 20 to 50 seats would be enormous. It also pointed out the added costs associated of layover lodging, meals, and
per diem, and the significant incremental weight of an added crewmember.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The FAA received additional clarification from Sun Country indicating that the proposed rule would cost $2.6 million.
The annual cost to deadhead flight attendants to their domicile would be $832,000. In addition, hotel accommodations
would be $842,000, added per diem cost would be $308,000, initial and recurrent training would be $10,200, and administrative
costs would be $58,000. Because this commenter does not have any interline agreements, it would have to pay the added
costs for deadhead tickets. This commenter estimated that these costs would be $579,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon this cost estimate, the cost per added flight attendant would be about $76,500 per flight attendant ($2.6
million divided by 34 additional flight attendants). If this commenter did not have to incur the costs for deadhead

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter also provided information stating that the annual cost of applying the part 121 supplemental carrier
pilot flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants would be $1.75 million. The added cost of 20 flight
attendants would be $489,000. Hotel expenses would be $679,000; per diem costs would be $244,000; training would
cost $6,000; and administrative costs would be $34,000. Finally, the annual cost of deadheading flight attendants
back to their place of domicile would be $289,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon their total cost estimate, the cost per added flight attendant would be $1.75 million divided by 20 additional
flight attendants, or about $87,000 per flight attendant. If this commenter did not have to incur the costs for deadhead
tickets, then the added cost would be $72,600 per flight attendant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA contends that these cost estimates represent the costs associated with replacing the existing crew. The cost
estimates do not appear to represent the costs associated with augmenting the existing crew with additional flight
attendants. An air carrier whose goal is profit maximization and cost minimization would choose the least costly
means of achieving compliance with the proposed rule, and, in most cases, that appears to be the crew augmentation
option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RAA asserted that the final rule would impose costs based on the fact that some aircraft would fly longer than 14 hours
and full. The FAA contacted this commenter and asked a clarifying question on the number of times that an aircraft would
fly more than 14 hours full. The commenter was unable to provide information to substantiate this assertion, and therefore,
while a problem may exist, the FAA is unable to determine the magnitude of it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received additional information from a NACA member (American Trans Air) stating that, to calculate annual
costs, they multiplied the average number of block hours in the fleet by the percentage of flight hours the NPRM is expected
to affect. The product is the total number of affected block hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of affected block hours was then divided by the expected number of flight attendant utilization hours,
which varies by aircraft type, and multiplied by the number of flight attendants to compute crew requirements. Based
on this calculation, 20 additional flight attendants would be needed to meet the requirements of the proposed rule.
This commenter then multiplied the number of additional flight attendants by their annual salary, including fringe
benefits and training, to arrive at a cost estimate of $372,000. Administrative costs of $80,000 were added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received additional clarification that the percentage of flight hours was based upon the commenter's examination
of all flights that exceeded 14 hours. The commenter did not look at flights of 14 to 16 hours, 16 to 18 hours, or 18 to 20
hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter divided the number of affected block hours by the expected flight attendant utilization hours (Boeing
727, 60 hours; Boeing 757 and Lockheed L&hyph;1011, 56 hours). The commenter did not know how many duty periods this
represented. After multiplying this number by the number of flight attendants needed to complete crew requirements,
the commenter concluded that 20 additional flight attendants would be needed to augment its flights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The $13,000 annual salary represents a flight attendant's first-year salary without overtime. The 20 percent benefits
estimate represents the company's portion of employee benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent practicable, the cost information provided by commenters was used to revise the cost estimates in the
final regulatory evaluation.

Recordkeeping Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters provided the FAA with information on recordkeeping. The Air Transport Association estimated
that air carriers would incur a one-time expense for computer system program modifications of $2.0 million to $3.0
million. Delta Air Lines stated that the one-time cost of software computer changes, including recordkeeping, would
be $367,200. American Trans Air, a member of the National Air Carrier Association, stated that administrative costs
would be $80,000, approximately $54,000 of which would be the cost to program and upgrade software, and $26,000 of
which would be the cost of data entry and associated labor.

FAA Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of limited supporting documentation, a wide variation between commenters' estimates, and the difficulty
of ascertaining what portion of the recordkeeping costs could be attributed to the implementation of this final rule
versus the cost to upgrade current systems, the FAA stands by its original recordkeeping cost estimate.

Summary of Benefits and Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that the cost of compliance with the requirements of this final rule will be $42.7 million, discounted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although benefits cannot be quantified, the FAA concludes that the establishment of flight attendant duty period
limitations and rest requirements are warranted, because they will contribute to an overall enhancement of transport
category airplane safety and utility that will both promote and enhance the U.S. air transportation system.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by Federal regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if
a proposed rule would have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order
2100.14A outlines FAA's procedures and criteria for implementing the RFA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fleet size for an operator of aircraft for hire to be considered a small entity is nine or fewer aircraft. The threshold
annualized cost levels for operators of aircraft for hire in 1993 dollars are $117,800 for scheduled operators whose
fleets have aircraft with seating capacities of more than 60, $67,000 for scheduled operators whose fleets have aircraft
with seating capacities of 60 or less (other scheduled operators), and $4,570 for unscheduled operators. The proposals
in the NPRM would affect air carriers that provide passenger-carrying operations in aircraft for which flight attendants
are required. Other types of aviation companies would not be affected. A ``substantial number'' of small entities
is a number that is not less than 11 and that is more than one-third of the small entities subject to this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to FAA records of small entity air carriers that provide passenger-carrying operations in aircraft that
require flight attendants, there are 23 part 125 and 135 operators that could be affected by the final rule. Of these
23 operators, 7 are part 121/135 operators, 12 are part 125 operators, and 4 are part 135 operators. The affected operators
are those with nine or fewer aircraft. At least one of the aircraft that they own have a seating configuration of more
than 19 as described in either &sect;125.269 or &sect;135.107 and therefore would have at least one flight attendant
on board. There are also 8 part 121 operators that would be affected by the final rule. In July 1993, there were a total
of 25 part 121/135 operators, 39 part 125 operators, and 3,040 part 135 operators. There are also more than 100 part
121 operators. The number of carriers that could be affected by the rule does not exceed one-third of the total number
of carriers in any of the four categories of operators (parts 121, 121/125, 125 and 135). The FAA has therefore determined
that a regulatory flexibility analysis is not necessary.

International Trade Impact Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule would not constitute a barrier to international trade, including the export of American goods and
services to foreign countries and the import of foreign goods and services into the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that the amendments to parts 121 and 135 will not have a significant impact on international
trade. The final rule is not expected to have an impact on trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseas
or foreign firms doing business in the United States. This finding is based in large part upon the review of foreign
civil aviation regulations governing flight attendant flight and duty time practices and minimum rest requirements
found in the Industry Study as well as information supplied by commenters to the public docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Industry Study review shows that 23 countries, including Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, the Netherlands,
France, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and West Germany, have government regulations on flight attendant
flight and duty times and rest periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment provided by the Flight Attendants states that the European Community, through its Joint Aviation Authority
(JAA) ``is poised to issue flight attendant duty time and rest provisions which would be based on state of the art research
concerning work schedules and fatigue.'' They state that the JAA rule would base duty time and rest limits on the time
of departure and the number of segments flown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the Industry Study noted that 24 countries, including Australia, Canada, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Japan, and Mexico, do not regulate flight attendant work time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concludes that there are many countries with flight attendant flight and duty times and rest periods and many
countries without these regulations. Second, many firms in the United States appear to be already in compliance or
near compliance with the final regulation. Therefore, the FAA has determined that the amendments to parts 121, 125,
and 135, will not have a significant impact on international trade.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national
government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this regulation will not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the FAA has determined that this regulation is a significant regulatory
action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the rule is considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures. However, the FAA has determined that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact,
positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities or on international trade. A final regulatory evaluation
of the regulation, including a final Regulatory Flexibility Determination and International Trade Impact Analysis,
has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under

must, after notification by the Administrator, make any changes in the procedures that are found necessary by the
Administrator. Within 30 days after the certificate holder receives such notice, it may file a petition to reconsider
the notice with the FAA Flight Standards District Office that is charged with the overall inspection of the certificate
holder's operations. The filing of a petition to reconsider stays the notice, pending decision by the Administrator.
However, if the Administrator finds that an emergency requires immediate action in the interest of safety, the Administrator

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Transportation is making a series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of minor or technical amendments to its drug and alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing procedures. The most significant of these include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising the initial test cutoff level for marijuana 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolites, changing split specimen collection procedures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be consistent with those of the Department of Health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Human Services, revising the temperature range for urine drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specimens, revising the drug testing custody and control form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and modifying the alcohol testing form, clarifying laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting procedures to consortiums, deleting a requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a second ``air blank'' after alcohol confirmation tests, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifying procedures related to the display of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sequential number for alcohol tests, and clarifying chain of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
custody requirements. The changes have the purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
updating the procedures to be consistent with Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health and Human Services guidelines and addressing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation problems of which the Department has become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aware.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is publishing this final rule to make several minor or technical amendments to its drug and alcohol
testing procedures, 49 CFR Part 40. The changes to Part 40 are described below. The changes are intended, among other
things, to conform Part 40 to a number of provisions in the recently revised Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) guidelines (59 FR 29908; June 9, 1994) and to correct a misinterpretation of the Department's chain of custody
requirements. The Department is seeking comments on these amendments and will publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 responding to comments received including, if appropriate, any changes to the amendments based on the comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Drug Testing Custody and Control Form
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the result of a lengthy process of consultation among the Department of Transportation, the Department of Health
and Human Services (DHHS), and other interested parties, the Department has made modifications to the drug testing
custody and control form. This form will be used in Federal employee testing as well as testing under DOT rules. The
form is reproduced in Appendix A. OMB has approved the form under the Paperwork Reduction Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current rule, program participants have had the discretion to modify the drug testing custody and control
form, as long as the contents of the form met the requirements of the regulatory text describing the form in &sect;40.23(a).
In the Department's experience, this has led to a proliferation of different forms, with consequent confusion and
increased probability of error. In the alcohol testing procedures, we required employers to use the Department's
alcohol testing form without modification. Now that we have an improved drug testing custody and control form, we
believe that it should be used universally in the program, without exception and without modification. For this reason,
we are amending &sect;40.23 to delete the regulatory text description of the form (which is no longer needed, since
everyone would be using exactly the form printed in Appendix A) and to require participants in the program to use the
Department's form without modification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that participants have stocks of existing forms. To provide participants a reasonable time to exhaust
these stocks and begin to obtain new forms, this amendment will not be made effective until February 16, 1995. In addition,
we are providing 60 days for interested persons to comment on this amendment (i.e., on the requirement to use the form
without modification, not on the content or format of the form itself). Employers and other participants are authorized
to use the new form immediately. We believe it would be very useful for those employers who must begin split sample testing
on August 15, 1994, to begin using the new form as soon as possible, since we believe the new form is better suited to split
sample testing than its predecessors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We emphasize that seven-part forms must be used in all cases for split samples. Older seven-part split sample forms
may continue to be used during the six month transition period (six-part forms may 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
never
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be used in split sample testing). After that, the new seven-part form must be used. RSPA and Coast Guard employers who
choose to use 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
single
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sample collection may continue to use old six-part forms during the six month transition period, and thereafter must
use the new form, discarding copy three.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Alcohol Testing Form and Log Book
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Copy 1 of the Alcohol Testing Form (the original) is designated as the breath alcohol technician's (BAT's)
copy of the form, for which there is no record retention requirement stated. Copy 3 is designated the employer's copy,
which the employer must retain. It makes more sense, in our view, for the original of the form to be retained by the employer,
rather than a copy. Consequently, we are switching the form designations, so that Copy 1 will be the employer's copy
and Copy 3 will be the BAT's copy. The statement to be signed by the employee in Step 4 of the form is reworded slightly
to emphasize the employee's agreement that the test reflected on the form is the test that the employee took and that
the result is recorded accurately.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;40.59(c), in the context of the discussion of the log book, the rule requires the notation of the ``quantified
test result.'' The Department intends that this result be the numerical result displayed by the EBT. The term has the
same meaning as the term ``result displayed on the EBT'' elsewhere in the rule (e.g., &sect;40.63(d)(1)(i)), and
we are changing the term for the sake of consistency.

Clarification of Reference to NHTSA CPL in Definition of ``EBT''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Conforming Products List (CPL) for Evidential Breath
Testing Devices (EBTs) includes both devices that meet September 1993 amendments to NHTSA's model specifications
and devices that meet only the previous version of the model specifications. Only those devices on the CPL that meet
the September 1993 model specifications may be used in the DOT alcohol testing program. Other devices on the CPL (those
designated by an asterisk on the published CPL; see for instance 59 FR 18840 (April 20, 1994)) are not authorized for
use in DOT-mandated alcohol testing programs. We are adding a reference to the September 1993 model specifications
in the definition of ``EBT'' in &sect;40.3 to clarify this point.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Split Sample Collection Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's procedures for collecting split samples for drug testing direct the collection site person to pour
the urine from a collection container into one or two specimen bottles (depending on the collection method used).
Some concern has been raised that this requirement would preclude the use of newer technologies that would subdivide
a specimen into a primary and a split specimen without the necessity of a collection site person physically pouring
the urine from one vessel into another. The Department does not intend its procedures to preclude the use of such methods
or systems, as long as they result in primary and split samples that can be transmitted to laboratories and tested in
ways that fully comply with Part 40 requirements. We have added language to this effect. The Department does not endorse
drug testing products, and this change should not be construed as an endorsement of any particular product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In using whichever of the authorized methods of collecting split samples, the Department advises collectors that
we believe the preferred practice is to have temperature strips attached to the collection container, which can reduce
the time lag in checking the temperature and reduce the likelihood of errors or delays. The temperature should be read,
of course, from the collection container itself, rather than from another bottle into which the split specimen may
be poured.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 40.25(f)(10)(ii)(C) of the Department's current regulation describes one of the alternative split specimen
collection procedures. In this procedure, a single specimen bottle is used as the collection container. The collection
site person pours 30 ml of the urine from this container into a second specimen bottle, which is then used as the primary
specimen. The urine remaining in the collection container becomes the split specimen. When DHHS published its revised
drug testing guidelines, however, DHHS provided that, in this situation, the collection site person would pour 15
ml of the urine into the second bottle, to be used as the split specimen, with 30 ml remaining in the collection container,
to be used as the primary specimen. In other words, the DHHS procedure was the reverse of the one we issued in February.
While there are advantages to the procedure in the current Part 40, we believe, on balance, that it is more important
that the DHHS guidelines and Part 40 be consistent on this point. Consequently, we are changing our procedures to conform
with those of DHHS.

The revised DHHS guidelines modify the temperature range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within which a specimen must fall in order to avoid creating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a reason to believe that a urine specimen has been altered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituted. The old range is 32.5&hyph;37.7C/90.5&hyph;99.8F. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new range is 32&hyph;38C/90&hyph;100F. Part 40 references are being

Clarification of Chain of Custody Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 40.25 contains a number of references to use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain of custody documentation in the handling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation of urine specimens. Recently, an arbitrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misinterpreted these provisions, determining that a chain of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
custody was invalid, and that the test must be canceled, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because persons involved solely in the transportation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intact shipping container did not make a chain of custody 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry. This interpretation is contrary to Part 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, wholly unnecessary in order to preserve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of the process, and, if followed, would result in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wholesale disruption of the DOT testing program. As DHHS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recently pointed out in its revised drug testing guidelines, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Since specimens are sealed in packages that would indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any tampering during transit to the laboratory and couriers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
express carriers, and postal service personnel do not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to the chain of custody forms, there is no requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such personnel document chain of custody for the package 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during transit.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department interprets its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
existing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions as not requiring couriers, postal employees, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other personnel involved in the transportation of urine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specimens to make chain of custody form entries. Likewise, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department interprets its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
existing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
rules as not requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making entries on the chain of custody form when a sealed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipping container is put into or removed from temporary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secure storage. In present &sect;40.25(c), for example, handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or transportation of a specimen from one ``place'' to another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be accomplished through chain of custody procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department interprets this as meaning that as long as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is an entry from an individual authorized to release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the specimen from the collection site ( ``Place'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another from an individual authorized to receive it on behalf 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the laboratory (``Place'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2), the persons who perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervening, ministerial transportation services (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
couriers, truck drivers, airplane pilots, postal service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees, mail room employees) need not make such entries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Present paragraph 40.25(h) authorizes chain of custody 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation to be ``enclosed'' in the shipping container for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipment to the laboratory. This container is sealed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tamper-evident tape. As a program matter, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommends enclosing chain of custody documentation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipping container, as opposed to attaching it to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exterior of the container, since this minimizes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood of loss of or damage to the documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interpreting the rule to require persons performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervening transportation services to make chain of custody 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entries would nullify this important provision of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to make chain of custody entries, intervening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation personnel would have to break the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tamper-evident seal, dig out the documentation, make an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry, reinsert the documentation, and re-seal the container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of course, a shipping container with a seal that had been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broken and re-sealed a number of times would make it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unlikely, if not impossible, for a valid test to be conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the specimen it contained. The Department could not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpret its regulations to create such an absurd result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Present &sect;40.25 (k) directs the use of a chain of custody 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form ``from the point of collection to the final disposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the specimen.'' This provision directs that every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual ``in the chain'' be identified. Unlike authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection site and laboratory personnel, who actually handle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the specimen, intervening transportation personnel are not, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly speaking, ``in the chain'' at all, a point which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department has understood to be consistent with long-standing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case law in a variety of contexts. Consequently, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department never understood or intended this language to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that intervening transportation personnel make chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of custody entries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A related issue, raised in the same arbitration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision, concerns temporary secure storage. That is, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection site person conducts the test, fills out the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
custody and control form, places the specimen and form in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sealed shipping container, and places the container in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secure, temporary storage at the collection site, where a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
courier picks it up subsequently for transportation to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory. Again, any tampering would be revealed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tamper-evident seal. Here, too, requiring an entry in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain of custody for putting the package into and removing it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the temporary secure storage is unnecessary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disruptive. Alternatives, such as not sealing the chain of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
custody documentation in the shipping container until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately before pickup, or attaching the chain of custody 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation to the outside of the shipping container when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is ready for pickup, multiply the possibilities for error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We emphasize that the collector should, as a matter of good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice, document in its own records the times at which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sealed shipping containers are put into and removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary secure storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the Department's reasonable construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its existing regulatory language, which has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communicated in the past to persons raising the question, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least one arbitrator did misinterpret these provisions. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the possibility of any such mistakes in the future, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department it taking this opportunity to clarify its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. To this end, we are adding language very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to that of DHHS to &sect;40.25 (c), (h), and (k), as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an additional sentence that strongly emphasizes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underlines that chains of custody need not include entries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from such personnel in order to be valid. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments to these paragraphs make clear that the absence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entries in the chain of custody relating to the putting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
package into or retrieving it from temporary secure storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the collection site does not invalidate the chain of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
custody. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is making this amendment effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately, because it is essential to protect DOT drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing procedures from misinterpretations that, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
followed, could invalidate virtually all chains of custody 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for DOT drug tests, even though they follow Part 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. This necessity constitutes the good cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the Administrative Procedure Act to make a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation effective without the normal 30-day effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In split sample testing, there could be situations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the primary specimen reaches the laboratory unscathed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but the split specimen does not. Instead, the split specimen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is untestable, inadequate, or unavailable. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
split specimen container may have leaked, leaving an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadequate amount of urine for testing. What is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory to do? To answer this question, which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department has been asked on a number of occasions, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adding a paragraph to &sect;40.29. The paragraph directs the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory to go ahead and test the primary specimen in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usual way. The laboratory then sends the result of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the primary specimen to the MRO in the usual way. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test result from the laboratory was a confirmed positive, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the MRO verifies the result as positive, then the employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has 72 hours to request a test of the split specimen. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employee does so, the MRO will pass the request on to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory. It is only at this point, and not before, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the laboratory informs the MRO that the split specimen is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
untestable, inadequate, or unavailable. The MRO would then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancel the test. This approach is consistent with existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT guidance and the DHHS guidelines.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vast majority of tests of primary specimens have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative results. Of those that test positive, a portion are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verified negative by MROs. Of those verified positive by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MROs, not all will result in a timely request by the employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a test of the split specimen. In view of these facts, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be counterproductive for the laboratory to reject an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise testable primary specimen because the split 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specimen was unavailable, inadequate, or untestable. Nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would it be cost-effective for the laboratory to notify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MRO of the problem with the split specimen at an earlier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage of the process, which could result in the cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of tests that may otherwise stand up. There is no loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection to the employee, who will be in no worse position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than if there was a testable split specimen. As a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter, employers using split sample collection should not, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a matter of prudence, take irrevocable action (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminate, as opposed to suspend) against an employee until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the result of the split specimen is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Split specimens may become unavailable for testing at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other stages of the process (e.g., the receiving laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mishandles or loses the split specimen in storage, the split 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specimen is lost in transit between the receiving laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the second laboratory which would analyze the split). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all these cases, the same rule applies. The MRO is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notified of the unavailability, inadequacy, or untestability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the split specimen unless and until there is a verified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive test and the employee has made a timely request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a test of the split specimen.

Reduction of Marijuana Initial Test Level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its June 9, 1994, revision to its drug testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines, DHHS reduced the initial test level for marijuana 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolites from 100 ng/ml to 50 ng/ml. This rule changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the initial test level for marijuana in Part 40 to conform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the revised DHHS guidelines. This change is consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the existing language of &sect;40.29(e)(2), which states that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the initial test levels for drugs are subject to change by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DHHS. Since the new DHHS guidelines go into effect September 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1, 1994, this provision will be effective on that date, so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that DHHS and DOT testing level requirements remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with one another.

The Department is also adding to the chart in this

section showing confirmation test levels a new footnote 3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stating that, to be confirmed positive, a specimen containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methamphetamine must also contain amphetamine at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration equal to or greater than 200 ng/ml. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Reports to Employers and Consortia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 40.29(g)(6), concerning monthly statistical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary reports from laboratories to employers, has been the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject of some confusion since it does not specify the role 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of consortia in the reporting chain. Laboratories had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed concern that they were not authorized, by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present language of the paragraph, to provide these reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a consortium instead of to individual employers. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department is revising this paragraph to clarify this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter. Suppose a laboratory tests specimens originating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with employers 1&hyph;100, all of whom are part of Consortium X. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The laboratory may send its report summary only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consortium X, rather than sending 100 single reports to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the employers. However, the data provided to Consortium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
X must include employer-specific information for each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers and, within 14 days of receiving the laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report, Consortium X is responsible for sending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer-specific data to each of the 100 employers. When, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as provided in the last sentence of &sect;40.29(g)(6), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer-specific data is withheld because no testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertinent to the employer was held, or because release of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data would permit inferences about individual employees' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identity, the written reports concerning the withholding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data may also be provided to the employer via the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consortium, through the mechanism described above.

MRO Conflicts of Interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its revised guidelines, DHHS has added a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision prohibiting relationships between laboratories and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical review officers (MROs) that could have the reality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or create the appearance of a conflict of interest. DHHS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added this provision in the belief, with which DOT concurs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that any such relationship that could be construed as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conflict of interest may be sufficient to undermine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of the program. For this reason and to remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with DHHS guidelines on this important issue, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department is adding the DHHS language to &sect;40.29(n).

Removal of Requirement for Second Air Blank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The alcohol testing procedures in Subpart C, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originally issued, contained a requirement that the breath 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol technician conduct an ``air blank'' (i.e., an internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
check of calibration) both before and after every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmation test. Failure to do so, or a result for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air blank that exceeded 0.00, is a ``fatal flaw'' that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically invalidates a test. We have decided, on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further reflection, that the air blank after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmation test is unnecessary. The main point of an air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blank is to ensure that each employee has a testing device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is a ``clean slate,'' unaffected by any alcohol from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous tests or other sources. The pre-test air blank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplishes this objective fully; the post-test air blank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not necessary for this purpose. Moreover, on some breath 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing devices, particularly where a test has shown a high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol concentration, it may take several minutes for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol to clear from the device. Under the existing rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the breath alcohol technician were to do a post-test air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blank under these circumstances too soon, it could result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a reading above 0.00, invalidating an otherwise valid test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because it is unnecessary, and to avoid problems of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kind, we are deleting the provision requiring a post-test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air blank and the provision making the failure to conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 such a test a ``fatal flaw.''

Display of Sequential Test Numbers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 40.53(b)(2) requires that EBTs used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmation tests be capable of assigning a unique 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sequential number to each test, which can be read by the BAT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the employee before the test and printed out on each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copy of the test result. Section 40.79(a)(7) makes it a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``fatal flaw'' if the sequential number displayed on the EBT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the test is not the same as the sequential number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
printed on the test result. However, the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation leaves a gap between these two points, since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for conducting alcohol tests (&sect;&sect;40.63 and 40.65) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not specify the handling of sequential numbers in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is adding language to fill this gap. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 40.65(e) is being revised to require the BAT to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the BAT and the employee read the displayed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sequential number before the confirmation test, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;40.65(h)(3) is revised to direct the BAT to enter in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Remarks'' section of the form any disparity between that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number and the sequential test number on the printed result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a disparity, per &sect;40.79, is a fatal flaw. We have made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parallel changes to &sect;40.63 (d)(1) and (e)(2), which apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations in which a screening test is conducted with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EBT that has the features specified in &sect;40.53(b) for EBTs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can be used for confirmation tests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The alcohol testing requirements of Part 40 currently call on employers or their agents to keep records of breath alcohol
technician (BAT) training and proficiency for two years. The Department is concerned that, for BATs who work as such
for longer than two years, this record retention requirement may not be sufficient. The Department requests comment
on whether this record retention requirement should be extended (e.g., to require retention of records of the training
of a BAT for as long as that BAT works for the employer). Such an extension would not apply, presumably, to BATs who were
no longer working for the employer.

Regulatory Analyses and Notices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is not a significant rule under Executive Order 12866 or under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures.
It does not impose costs on regulated parties and may, to a limited extent, reduce regulatory burdens (e.g., the provisions
concerning reporting and post-test air blanks). Consequently, a regulatory evaluation has not been prepared.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department finds, for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act, that issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking
on these subjects is unnecessary, impracticable, or contrary to the public interest. This is because the amendments
are conforming changes to actions of the Department of Health and Human Services or joint DOT/DHHS actions (the change
in the marijuana initial test level, the new Federal drug testing custody and control form), important clarifications
the rapid issuance of which is in the public interest (the clarifications to the split sample collection procedures,
the chain of custody requirements, and the laboratory reporting procedures regarding consortia), or a correction
of what we have come to regard as a mistake in procedures that have not been implemented (removal of the post-test air
blank requirement).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The particular effective dates are established for the following reasons. The 180-day effective date for the requirement
to use the new drug testing custody and control form is established in order to give participants time to exhaust stocks
of existing forms and also to give interested persons a 60-day opportunity to comment on this matter. The August 15
effective date for amendments pertaining to split sample testing procedures was established in view of the August
15 starting date for mandatory split sample testing in the aviation, motor carrier, and railroad industries. The
September 1 effective date for the amendments to the initial test level for marijuana is established to be consistent
with the September 1 effective date of the revised DHHS guidelines, with which the Department's requirements in this
matter should be consistent. The immediate effective date for the amendments to the chain of custody is established
because of the necessity of immediately correcting an error that could create potentially serious damage to the program.

(c) Chain of Custody. The chain of custody block of the drug testing custody and control form shall be properly executed
by authorized collection site personnel upon receipt of specimens. Handling and transportation of urine specimens
from one authorized individual or place to another shall always be accomplished through chain of custody procedures.
Since specimens and documentation are sealed in shipping containers that would indicate any tampering during transit
to the laboratory and couriers, express carriers, and postal service personnel do not have access to the chain of custody
forms, there is no requirement that such personnel document chain of custody for the shipping container during transit.
Nor is there a requirement that there be a chain of custody entry when a specimen which is sealed in such a shipping container
is put into or taken out of secure storage at the collection site prior to pickup by such personnel. This means that the
chain of custody is not broken, and a test shall not be canceled, because couriers, express carriers, postal service
personnel, or similar persons involved solely with the transportation of a specimen to a laboratory, have not documented
their participation in the chain of custody documentation or because the chain of custody does not contain entries
related to putting the specimen into or removing it from secure temporary storage at the collection site. Every effort
shall be made to minimize the number of persons handling specimens.

(h) Transportation to Laboratory. Collection site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel shall arrange to ship the collected specimen to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the drug testing laboratory. The specimens shall be placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in shipping containers designed to minimize the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of damage during shipment (e.g., specimen boxes and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
padded mailers); and those containers shall be securely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sealed to eliminate the possibility of undetected tampering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the specimen and/or the form. On the tape sealing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipping container, the collection site person shall sign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and enter the date specimens were sealed in the shipping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container for shipment. The collection site person shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the chain of custody documentation is enclosed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in each container sealed for shipment to the drug testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory. Since specimens and documentation are sealed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipping containers that would indicate any tampering during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transit to the laboratory and couriers, express carriers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and postal service personnel do not have access to the chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of custody forms, there is no requirement that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel document chain of custody for the shipping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container during transit. Nor is there a requirement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there be a chain of custody entry when a specimen which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sealed in such a shipping container is put into or taken out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of secure storage at the collection site prior to pickup by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such personnel. This means that the chain of custody is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broken, and a test shall not be canceled, because couriers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
express carriers, postal service personnel, or similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons involved solely with the transportation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specimen to a laboratory, have not documented their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the chain of custody documentation or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the chain of custody does not contain entries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to putting the specimen into or removing it from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secure temporary storage at the collection site.

A chain of custody 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form (and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory internal chain of custody document, where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable), shall be used for maintaining control and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountability of each specimen from the point of collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to final disposition of the specimen. The date and purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be documented on the form each time a specimen is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handled or transferred and every individual in the chain of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
custody shall be identified. Since specimens and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation are sealed in shipping containers that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate any tampering during transit to the laboratory and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
couriers, express carriers, and postal service personnel do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have access to the chain of custody forms, there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that such personnel document chain of custody 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the shipping container during transit. Nor is there a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that there be a chain of custody entry when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specimen which is sealed in such a shipping container is put 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into or taken out of secure storage at the collection site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to pickup by such personnel. This means that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain of custody is not broken, and a test shall not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canceled, because couriers, express carriers, postal service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel, or similar persons involved solely with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation of a specimen to a laboratory, have not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented their participation in the chain of custody 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation or because the chain of custody does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain entries related to putting the specimen into or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing it from secure temporary storage at the collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site. Every effort shall be made to minimize the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons handling specimens.

(6) The laboratory shall provide the employer an aggregate quarterly statistical summary of urinalysis testing
of the employer's employees. Laboratories may provide the report to a consortium provided that the laboratory provides
employer-specific data and the consortium forwards the employer-specific data to the respective employers within
14 days of receipt of the laboratory report. The laboratory shall provide the report to the employer or consortium
not more than 14 calendar days after the end of the quarter covered by the summary. Laboratory confirmation data only
shall be included from test results reported within that quarter. The summary shall contain only the following information:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Number of specimens received for testing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Number of specimens confirmed positive for_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(E) Amphetamines; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Number of specimens for which a test was not performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quarterly reports shall not contain personal identifying information or other data from which it is reasonably likely
that information about individuals' tests can be readily inferred. If necessary, in order to prevent disclosure
of such data, the laboratory shall not send such a report until data are sufficiently aggregated to make such an inference
unlikely. In any quarter in which a report is withheld for this reason, or because no testing was conducted, the laboratory
shall so inform the consortium/employer in writing.

(d) Before the confirmation test is administered for

each employee, the BAT shall ensure that the EBT registers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.00 on an air blank. If the reading is greater than 0.00, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the BAT shall conduct one more air blank. If the reading is

greater than 0.00, testing shall not proceed using that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument, which shall be taken out of service. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing may proceed on another instrument. Any EBT taken

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its Planning and Performing Site Development Work regulation.
This proposal is consistent with Section 716 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 which amended Section
535 of the Housing Act of 1949 to allow the Secretary to accept subdivisions that have been approved by local, county
or State agencies. FmHA will no longer review or approve subdivisions, but will review individual sites for the program.
This action is consistent with similar actions being proposed or enacted by HUD and VA. A good site approval authority
will allow FmHA to bring into the program many low cost homes in subdivisions that have already been developed. Many
of these were not previously reached because the seller would not, or could not afford to furnish FmHA all the required
data for a total subdivision approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assure that lower income people, particularly minorities and single women head-of-households, are afforded
quality sites, subdivisions must meet the community standards and the sites must meet FmHA's site underwriting criteria.
Environmental reviews will be required on a site by site basis and cumulative effects will be addressed when indicated.

The Department of Agriculture is committed to carrying out its statutory and regulatory mandates in a manner that
best serves the public interest. Therefore, where legal discretion permits, the Department actively seeks to promulgate
regulations that promote economic growth, create jobs, are minimally burdensome and are easy for the public to understand,
use or comply with. In short, the Department is committed to issuing regulations that maximize the net benefits to
society and minimize costs imposed by those regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has developed and reviewed this regulatory proposal in accordance with these principles. Nonetheless,
the Department believes that public input from all interested persons can be invaluable to ensuring that the final
regulatory product is minimally burdensome and maximally efficient. Therefore, the Department specifically seeks
comments and suggestions from the public regarding any less burdensome or more efficient alternative that would
accomplish the purposes described in the proposal. Comments suggesting less burdensome or more efficient alternatives
should be addressed to the agency as provided in this proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FmHA stands alone as the only Federal Agency that requires approval of a complete subdivision prior to insuring or
guaranteeing a loan for a home within the subdivision. Developers, builders, realtors and applicants for the programs
have frequently complained that there is too much ``red tape'' before an eligible applicant can receive an FmHA loan
within a well developed subdivision. Most counties and communities now have adequate subdivision reviews, and FmHA's
subdivision approval is not needed to assure quality sites but is duplication of efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action permits the better use of existing developments and decreases the environmental impact because not as
many new developments will be needed to meet the demand for lots that will meet the Agency's requirements. It fits into
existing growth patterns and places more authority with the local people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FmHA is committed to quality sites for its programs and therefore, proposes close scrutiny of the site. The new site
criteria incorporates many of the prior subdivision requirements and makes them part of the site underwriting criteria.
This action provides for better sites, without requiring the cumbersome subdivision review and approval process.
It also provides the loan applicant with assurance of a quality water supply and property served by publicly owned
and maintained roads. The proposal provides for an orderly request for review and systematic process of reviewing
the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed regulation omits the detailed internal agency administrative instruction used by the field offices
to administer the program. In the past, FmHA program regulations and FmHA Instructions have been identical. The Agency
has adopted a policy of publishing regulations which set forth anything which confers a benefit or imposes an obligation
on the public or which is necessary for the public to understand their responsibilities. The Agency does not intend
to publish a regulation that omits or evades issues which are subject to public comment or would be of interest to the
public. Any substantive changes in the regulation will continue to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each FmHA field office has a copy of the FmHA Instruction and a copy is available upon request to FmHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conforming changes will be made in other FmHA regulations at the final rule stage.

 Planning is an evaluation of specific development for specific land uses. Planning must take into consideration
topography, soils, climate, adjacent land use, environmental impacts, energy efficiency, local economy, aesthetic
and cultural values, public and private services, housing and social conditions and a degree of flexibility to accommodate
changing demands. Although all planning and performing development work is the responsibility of the applicant
or developer, close coordination must occur with local planning officials and with the respective Agency office
to minimize the chances of spending money on development that does not meet the Agency's requirements. All development
will be arranged and completed according to applicable local, State or Federal regulations including applicable
health and safety standards, environmental concerns and requirements of this subpart. When a public authority requires
inspections prior to final acceptance, written assurance by the responsible public authority, of compliance to
local, city, county, State or other public codes, regulations and ordinances is required prior to final acceptance
by the Agency.

(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Site development design requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Environmental review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An individual Single Family Housing loan is normally considered a Categorical Exclusion under the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA). However, Form FmHA 1940&hyph;22, ``Environmental Checklist for Categorical Exclusions,''
must be completed by the Agency to determine that the specific action complies not only with NEPA, but also with other
applicable environmental laws, executive orders, and regulations. To complete the form, the preparer will use reliable
environmental information. Sources of such information include, but are not limited to, the State's Natural Resource
Management Guide and the appraisal. If the completed Form FmHA 1940&hyph;22 indicates a potential impact to one or
more environmental resources, the action is subject to disqualification as Categorical Exclusion and a Class I assessment
must be completed in accordance with &sect;1940.317(g) of subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter. If it is obvious at
the outset that the action will be disqualified as a Categorical Exclusion, the preparer should forego completion
of Form FmHA 1940&hyph;22 and proceed directly to the Class I assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If it appears that an action will be subject to disqualification as a Categorical Exclusion due to indications
of cumulative impacts, a Class I or Class II assessment will be completed, as appropriate, in accordance with subpart
G of Part 1940 of this chapter. A cumulative impact is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental
impact of the proposed action, when added to other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless
of what Agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions.

Multiple family housing projects shall be located in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (r) of &sect;1944.215
of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter. Locating sites in less than desirable locations of the community or in close
proximity to undesirable influences such as railroad tracks, cemeteries; adjacent to or behind commercial sites;
bordering structures which are not decent, safe, or sanitary or a positive conducive influence on the proposed site;
bordering sites which have potential environmental concerns such as processing plants, etc., is not acceptable.
Screening such sites does not make them acceptable. Sites which are not an integral part of a residential community
and do not have a reasonable access, either by location or terrain, to essential community facilities such as water,
sewerage, schools, shopping, employment opportunities, medical facilities, etc., are equally not acceptable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals processed under this paragraph shall be served by centrally owned and operated water and wastewater disposal
systems unless this is determined to be economically or environmentally unfeasible. All central systems, whether
they are public, community or private, shall meet the design requirements of the State Department of Health or other
comparable reviewing and regulatory authority(ies). The regulatory authority(ies) will verify in writing that
the water and wastewater systems are in compliance with the current provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act and the
Clean Water Act, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Sites which are not presently served by a central system, but are scheduled for tie-in to the central system within
2 years should have all lines installed during the initial construction. Such developments must have an approved
interim water supply or wastewater disposal system installed capable of satisfactory service until the scheduled
tie-in occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In addition to written assurance of compliance with State and local requirements, there must be assurance of
continuous service at reasonable rates for central water and wastewater disposal systems. Public ownership is preferred
whenever possible. In cases where interim facilities are installed pending extension or construction of permanent
public services, the developer must assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the interim facility
or establish an entity for its operation and maintenance which is acceptable to the local governing body. If a system
is not or will not be publicly owned and operated, it must comply with one of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Be an organization that meets the ownership and operating requirements for a water or wastewater disposal system
that the Agency could finance under subpart A of part 1942 of this chapter or be dedicated to and accepted by such an organization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Be an organization or individual that meets other acceptable methods of ownership and operation as outlined in
HUD Handbook 4075.12, ``Ownership and Organization of Central Water and Sewerage Systems.'' The Agency should be
assured that the organization has the right, in its sole discretion, to enforce the obligation of the operator of the
water and/or sewerage systems to provide satisfactory continuous service at reasonable rates. The advice and assistance
of the Regional Attorney should be obtained in preparing any necessary agreement with the organization or individual
supplying water and/or sewerage systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Be adequately controlled as to rates and services by a public body (unit of Government or public services commission).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When central systems are not available, the Agency will thoroughly evaluate the proposed individual systems
for economic feasibility and potential impact on the environment. Information and guidance for evaluation and design
of individual water and wastewater systems is contained in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publications
``Manual of Individual Water Supply Systems'' and ``Design Manual, Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems'',
respectively. Developments of more than 25 dwelling units with individual systems must have the National Office
concurrence. A request for concurrence must contain written recommendations and the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Information prepared by the local, county or State regulatory authority having jurisdiction indicating whether
individual systems are feasible on the proposed sites. Supporting factual data should include evidence that clearly
shows that individual systems will perform satisfactorily for a reasonable period of time with reasonable maintenance
cost. Reasonable time and reasonable cost can be equated with the cost and expected life of a central system if one were
available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Supporting information for the proposed individual water systems, covering the following points: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its regulations that are utilized by the Rural Development
Administration (RDA) in administering Community Facility Loans and Grants. This action is necessary to implement
a provision of the Rural Electrification Administration Loan Restructuring Act of 1993, (REA Act) and change the
security requirements for solid waste disposal loans. The REA Act prohibits that a condition for assistance under
any RDA program be a requirement that the recipient of such assistance accept or receive electric service from any
particular utility, supplier, or cooperative. Also, a change is proposed in the security requirements for loans
secured primarily by revenue and the funds used to construct or improve solid waste facilities in rural communities.
The intended effect of changing the security requirements for solid waste facilities is to provide better service
to communities seeking to resolve solid waste disposal problems on a regional level.

The regulation has been reviewed in light of Executive Order 12778 and meets the applicable standards provided in
sections 2(a) and (2)(b)(2) of that Order. Provisions within this part which are inconsistent with State law are controlling.
All administrative remedies pursuant to 7 CFR Part 1900 Subpart B must be exhausted prior to filing suit.

The information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0575&hyph;0015
in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507). This proposed rule does not revise or impose any new
information collection requirement from those approved by OMB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A change is proposed in the security requirements for loans made for construction or improvements to solid waste facilities.
The requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency Subtitle D regulations have increased the capital needs
of rural communities for disposal of solid waste. The current security requirements for loans on solid waste facilities
are too stringent, and this proposed action will add flexibility that is needed to improve the program. Currently,
additional security is required when revenue is the primary security for loans involving solid waste facilities.
The proposed change will remove the requirement for additional security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed action also incorporates into RDA loan and grant regulations the provision contained in the REA Act
of 1993 which prohibits a recipient of the programs from imposing certain conditions on the users of the service provided.
For example, a utility, supplier, or cooperative that provides electric service cannot obtain RDA financing for
a water system and require that the water customers connect to their electric system as a condition for receiving water.
The REA Act requires that appropriate measures and sanctions be implemented against any person violating or attempting
to violate this prohibition.

 Recipients of assistance processed in accordance with this subpart cannot require the users of the services provided
to accept or receive electric service from any particular utility, supplier, or cooperative. If the recipient of
assistance is a utility, supplier, or cooperative that provides electric service, the recipient must agree that
users of the facility financed will not be required to accept or receive electric service. All recipients that also
provide electric service must include the following in its rules and regulations: ``No existing or future user of
the facility financed by the Rural Development Administration has been or will be required to receive electric service
as a condition to utilize the services provided by the facility.'' A violation of this prohibition will result in the
acceleration of all loans received under this subpart and debarment from receiving future Federal financial assistance.
Compliance with this paragraph will be monitored through routine servicing procedures.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is announcing a revised date for the Technology Demonstration described in its proposed rule (59 FR
37360, July 21, 1994). The Department is also extending the deadline for submission of comments on the proposed rule
to Friday, September 30, 1994, to allow commenters additional time to incorporate into their comments any views they
have developed as a result of the Technology Demonstration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Department is announcing the availability of an electronic conference as another tool for interested
persons to exchange information and ideas on the computer loan origination (CLO) aspects of the proposed rule. The
electronic conference will be for discussion only; comments must still be in writing and submitted as described above
under the heading 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
addresses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to be considered by the Department during the development of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This on-line conference will run 24 hours per day from August 19, 1994, to September 30, 1994, and will provide industry
and individual users who access the conference an opportunity to discuss and debate with one another the CLO aspects
of the proposed rule through a computer network. The conference is called CLOnet and can be accessed by calling Metasystems
Design Group, Inc. (MDG), in Arlington, Virginia, telephone (703) 243&hyph;6622. There is a monthly charge of $20,
after which connect time is unlimited and free (other than long-distance charges). A personal computer (PC), modem,
and communications software are required to access the conference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is using this opportunity as a trial for supplementing its existing FHAnet with the subject-specific
CLOnet. Both conferences can provide an excellent interactive method for the public to ``meet'' on and discuss relevant
matters. Because the purpose of the current CLOnet is to provide an electronic medium for discussion of the effect
of the proposed rule on CLOs and consumers, any HUD employee who chooses to participate in the discussion may do so only
in his or her individual capacity and not in any official capacity as a representative of the Department.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposed on June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28594) to revise its Safety
and Health Regulations for Longshoring and, to a far lesser extent, to amend its Safety and Health Regulations for
Marine Terminals. The proposed rule covers cargo handling and related activities conducted aboard vessels and at
Marine Terminals. The proposed amendments to the Marine Terminals standard are intended primarily to provide regulatory
consistency with the proposed Longshoring ship-board rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The June 2, 1994 notice and subsequent correction notice on June 13, 1994 (59 FR 30389) announced the cities and dates
for three informal rulemaking hearings that will be held on all issues raised by the proposal. The dates of these hearings
have been changed. This notice sets the new dates and specific locations of the informal public hearings to be held
as part of the rulemaking process. In addition, it extends the original date for the submission of Notices of Intention
to Appear by three weeks and reduces the time frame for the submission of documentary evidence and the text of lengthy
testimony from 21 days to 14 days prior to the date of the hearing where the evidence will be presented.

Any party who has not filed a notice of intention to appear may be allowed to testify for no more than 10 minutes as time

Conduct and Nature of Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The hearing will commence at 9:30 a.m. on the first day. At that time, any procedural matters relating to the proceeding
will be resolved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of an informal rulemaking hearing is established in the legislative history of section 6 of the OSH Act and
is reflected by OSHA's rules of procedure for hearings (29 CFR 1911.15(a)). Although the presiding officer is an Administrative
Law Judge and questioning by interested persons is allowed on crucial issues, the proceeding is informal and legislative
in type. The Agency's intent is to provide interested persons with an opportunity to make effective oral presentations
which can proceed expeditiously in the absence of procedural restraints which might impede or protract the rulemaking
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, since the hearing is primarily for information gathering and clarification, it is an informal administrative
proceeding rather than an adjudicative one. The technical rules of evidence, for example, do not apply. The regulations
that govern hearings, and the pre-hearing guidelines which the ALJ will issue for this hearing, will ensure fairness
and due process and also facilitate the development of a clear, accurate and complete record. Those rules and guidelines
will be interpreted in a manner that furthers that development. Thus, questions of relevance, procedure and participation
generally will be decided so as to favor development of the record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will be conducted in accordance with 29 CFR part 1911. It should be noted that &sect;1911.4 allows the Assistant
Secretary, upon reasonable notice, to issue alternative procedures to expedite proceedings or for other good cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge who makes no decision or recommendation on the merits
of OSHA's proposal. The responsibility of the Administrative Law Judge is to ensure that the hearing proceeds at a
reasonable pace and in an orderly manner. The Administrative Law Judge, therefore, will have all the powers necessary
and appropriate to conduct a full and fair informal hearing as provided in 29 CFR part 1911, including the powers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. To regulate the course of the proceedings;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. To dispose of procedural requests, objections and comparable matters;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. To confine the presentations to the matters pertinent to the issues raised;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. To regulate the conduct of those present at the hearing by appropriate means;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. In the Judge's discretion, to question and permit the questioning of any witnesses and to limit the time for questioning;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. In the Judge's discretion, to keep the record open for a reasonable, stated time (known as the post-hearing comment
period) to receive written information and additional data, views and arguments from any person who has participated
in the oral proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recognizes that there may be interested persons or organizations who, through their knowledge of the subject
matter or their experience in the field, would wish to endorse or support the whole proposal or certain provisions
of the proposal. OSHA welcomes such supportive comments, including any pertinent data and cost information which
may be available, in order that the record of this rulemaking will present a balanced picture of public response on
the issues involved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is proposing to adopt permanent special local regulations for the annual Festival on the Fourth. This
event is held each year on July 4 on the Ashley River, at Charleston, South Carolina. In the past, the Coast Guard established
temporary special local regulations each year to protect the safety of life on the navigable waters during the effective
times. However, because the event recurs annually, the Coast Guard is proposing a permanent description of the event
and establishment of permanent regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to better serve the boating public
by creating a permanent reference.

Discussion of Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Charleston Water Festival, Inc., sponsors the Festival on the Fourth celebration. Approximately, two towboats,
one pick-up boat, forty waterskiers, and five jet skiers conduct various exhibitions during the Festival on the Fourth
event, including ski jumping, kite skiing and jet ski maneuvering. The event also closes with a fireworks display
on that portion of the Ashley River in Charleston, South Carolina, between Brittle Bank Park and the main river channel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The event's exhibitions, coupled with the fireworks display, create an extra hazard in the navigable waters and require
these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The regulated area encompasses less than one nautical mile on the Ashley River
from Brittle Bank Park to the main river channel in Charleston, South Carolina, entry into which is prohibited for
eleven and a half hours on the day of the event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Texas for the purpose
of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program.
The SIP revision was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in the Clean Air Act (CAA), to ensure
that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with
the CAA. In the Final Rules Section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule,
no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final
rule will be withdrawn, and all public comments received during the 30-day comment period set forth below will be addressed
in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should
do so at this time.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 8, 1994 (59 FR 5868), the EPA proposed standards (the proposal or proposed standards) to limit emissions
of hazardous air pollutants (HAP's) from existing and new bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations
under section 112 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (Act). The public comment period on the proposed rule ended
April 11, 1994. This action announces the availability of supplemental information and the reopening of the comment
period for comment on only the supplemental information. This supplemental information was provided during the
comment period on the proposal and pertains to the level of control and test procedures for tank truck leakage. The
EPA plans to consider comments received on this action, along with the comments received on the proposal, and take
final action on the rule on November 23, 1994 as required under consent decree. Due to this short schedule, only a 30-day
comment period is being provided and no public hearing will be held.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 8, 1994 (59 FR 5868), the EPA proposed standards to limit emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP's)
from existing and new bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations under section 112 of the Act. Two comment
letters presented information on California standards for tank truck leaks at existing facilities that are more
stringent than those standards proposed by the EPA. The EPA proposed that tank trucks and railcars annually pass a
pressure and vacuum test before loading gasoline at existing and new major source facilities. The California standards
have a more stringent requirement for the annual test, an additional annual test for internal vapor valves, and a year-round
leak rate requirement and test procedures. Additionally, the EPA proposed for new facilities the use of a loading
rack vacuum assist system, in addition to the proposed annual pressure and vacuum test, to further control leakage
from tank trucks and railcars. The EPA did not analyze nor fully discuss these California standards during development
of the proposal or at proposal. The purpose of this notice is to announce and discuss the consideration of these additional
standards. Below is a discussion of the California standard for tank truck leakage and the EPA's consideration of
that information. As noted in the

 section of today's notice, the docket (Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;38) contains the California test procedures and
methods discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California Air Resources Board (ARB) and the California air pollution control districts have been implementing
tank truck leakage standards since the late 1970's. Currently all tank trucks transporting gasoline in California,
including tank trucks from neighboring States that operate in California, must meet the California standards. In
summary they include three major standards, an annual certification and a year-round standard for the tank and its
vapor piping and hoses and a year-round pressure standard for the tank truck's internal vapor valve. The annual certification
standards include initially pressurizing and later evacuating the tank and associated vapor piping and hoses, to
18 inches of water and to 6 inches of water, respectively. In 5 minutes the allowable pressure change can be no more than
the values shown in Table 1. The EPA's Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) document and New Source Performance Standards
(NSPS) (40 CFR part 60, subpart XX) contain annual pressure and vacuum test levels of initial pressures and test duration
which are the same as California's. However, a less stringent pressure change of 3 inches of water column is allowed
for all tank trucks under the NSPS, CTG, and proposal.

Table 1 presents a year-round allowable pressure change standard that is 1.5 inches of water column higher than annual
certification allowable pressure change. This year-round standard is periodically demonstrated by a combustible
gas detector method or the annual certification test procedure (using the allowable year-round pressure change
value) by owners and operators and used by the California ARB and districts for audits and compliance, respectively.
Combustible gas detectors are easy to use and transport and can be used in the field while trucks are loading gasoline.
The annual certification pressure/vacuum test procedure requires the tank to be taken out of gasoline service and
requires more test equipment than the combustible gas detector method. Therefore, the combustible gas detector
method provides an easy-to-use field compliance procedure. Tank trucks with a leak found above 100 percent of the
lower explosive limit (LEL) on a combustible gas detector are required to be taken out of service until they pass the
allowable year-round pressure change using the annual certification test method. If the truck fails both tests,
the truck owner is fined and the tank is not allowed to return to service until it meets the annual certification standard.
Those tanks found to have leaks above 100 percent of the LEL and found to meet the year-round allowable pressure change
with the annual certification test procedure are not penalized if maintenance is not performed before the pressure
test. A similar combustible gas detector procedure was presented in the EPA's CTG, but is not contained in the NSPS
or this proposed NESHAP. However, some other States and oil companies are using this detector procedure as a compliance
method, in addition to the annual pressure and vacuum tests. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)
developed a field pressure test procedure that measures the pressure change without taking the tank out of service.
Nitrogen gas is used to pressurize the tank's vapor head space. This field pressure test method was determined by the
California ARB in 1986 to be equivalent to the combustible gas detector method. Since 1986, the BAAQMD has implemented
a comprehensive outreach program with the field pressure test. Operators are instructed in the field test procedure,
and participate in an ongoing inspection and maintenance program. Participation is voluntary, and the incentive
is to reduce the penalties for violations by having documentation showing a history of regular tests and maintenance
on the tank truck. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third California standard for tank trucks is the annually tested certification pressure test on the tank truck's
internal vapor valve. This valve provides a seal between the truck's tank and its vapor piping and connected hose.
For this test, the tank and associated vapor piping and hose are pressurized to 18 inches of water column, and the valve
is then closed. Then, while leaving the tank under pressure, the pressure in the tank truck's vapor collection piping
and vapor hose is released to atmospheric pressure and then capped. After 5 minutes, a pressure increase of no more
than 5 inches of water column is allowed to occur downstream of the valve in the tank truck's vapor piping and hose. Any
pressure increase indicates that the valve is leaking. This leakage would eventually be released to the atmosphere
when the vapor hose and piping are not connected to a vapor collection system. This standard for internal vapor valves
is not contained in the CTG, the NSPS, or the proposed standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California ARB is currently revising its tank truck standards to change the level of the annual test and is updating
its test procedures and methods. The BAAQMD tested 200 tank trucks and found that 86 percent of the trucks could pass
a 0.25-inch standard and 91 percent could pass a 0.5-inch standard. The California ARB proposed that the allowable
annual certification's allowable pressure change be reduced by 50 percent (1-inch drop is proposed to be reduced
to a 0.5-inch, etc.). Besides general updating and clarifications of the test procedures and methods, the California
ARB is adding the field pressure test used by BAAQMD in the ARB certification procedures.

Under section 112 of the Act, the minimum baseline (floor) at which standards may be set, for existing sources, is the
``average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources''(section 112(d)(3)
of the Act). The existing California standards are used statewide and on tank trucks from surrounding areas. California
is estimated to account for nearly 12 percent of the national gasoline consumption. Since trucks in California and
surrounding areas transport about 12 percent of the national gasoline, it is logical to assume that this represents
about 12 percent of the affected gasoline tank truck population. The EPA looks at emission limitations achieved by
each of the best performing 12 percent of existing sources, and average those limitations (59 FR 29196). ``Average''
is interpreted to mean a measure of central tendency such as the arithmetic mean or median. In the case of the California
standards, nearly or about 12 percent of tank trucks at least meet or exceed the California standards, therefore these
standards are at least the arithmetic average, and certainly the 94 percentile or median. Additionally, the existing
California standards achieve the lowest emission limitation (in this case by achieving the lowest leakage rates)
and are the best performing of existing sources. Thus, the EPA now considers the existing California standards as
the existing source floor since they represent the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12
percent of the existing sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA proposal contains a requirement to operate a vacuum assist system at new source facilities. The agency proposed
this requirement for new sources based on the system providing ``emission control that is achieved in practice by
the best controlled similar source'' (section 112(d)(3) of the Act). Many commenters questioned the amount of emission
control that would be achieved by the vacuum assist system. In the EPA's consideration of the vacuum assist system
as the floor for new sources, the EPA will also consider the existing California standards discussed earlier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through consideration of comments received on today's notice along with those on the proposed rule, the EPA will determine
the control levels to be applied to tank truck leakage. Today's opening of the comment period is only for taking comment
on the supplemental material contained in this notice on tank truck vapor leakage controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the EPA is requesting comments and data on the consideration of the existing California standards
as the floor level of control for new and existing facilities as required under section 112 of the Act. The EPA is also
requesting comment on whether the level of control for tank trucks at new and existing facilities should be based on
the existing or the proposed California standards. Comments are also requested on the use and accuracy of the test
procedures and methods referred to earlier and provided in the docket, including both the existing and updated or
revised procedures and methods.

Section 224(a) of the Public Health Service Act (the Act), (section 233(a) of Title 42 of the United States Code), provides
that the remedy against the United States provided under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) resulting from the performance
of medical, surgical, dental or related functions by any commissioned officer or employee of the Public Health Service
while acting within the scope of his office or employment shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding.
Public Law 102&hyph;501 provides that, subject to its provisions, certain entities and officers, employees and
contractors of entities shall be deemed to be employees of the Public Health Service within the exclusive remedy provision
of section 224(a). This proposed rule implements certain provisions of Pub. L. 102&hyph;501.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) meets the following requirements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) has implemented appropriate policies and procedures to reduce the risk of malpractice and the risk of lawsuits
arising out of any health or health-related functions performed by the entity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) has reviewed and verified the professional credentials, references, claims history, fitness, progressional
review organization findings, and license status of its physicians and other licensed or certified health care practitioners,
and, where necessary, has obtained the permission from these individuals to gain access to this information;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) has no history of claims having been filed against the United States as a result of the application of section 224
to the entity of its officers, employees, of contractors as provided for under this section, or, is such a history exists,
has fully cooperated with the Attorney General in defending against any such claims and either has taken, or will take,
any necessary corrective steps to assure against such claims in the future; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) has fully cooperated with the Attorney General in providing information relating to an estimate described under
section 224(k) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;6.5 provides that an entity will be deemed to be an entity described in section 224(g) as of the effective
date of the notice which it receives from the Department of Health and Human Services that it has been deemed to be an
entity as described for purposes of the Act. Each notice shall be effective only as to acts and omissions occurring
on and after the date specified in the notice and prior to January 1, 1996, the statutory sunset date for this program.
(Proposed &sect;6.6(a).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, grantees contract with other entities (as opposed to individual contractors_see section III below)
for the provision of health services. The typical situation is a subgrant or contract for the provision of the full
range of health services. For example, the legislative history of Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 describes the case of a grantee
in the Los Angeles area which itself has no clinical staff, but which contracts with three primary care clinics for
the actual delivery of services. If one (or more) of these clinics provides the full range of services mandated under
section 330 to its own medically undeserved population, in accordance with other applicable requirements under
section 330, it would be eligible for a determination by the Secretary that it too is a covered entity. (H.R. Rep. No.
102&hyph;823, Part 2, p. 7, 102d Cong. 2d Sess., Sept. 14, 1992.) Proposed &sect;6.3(b) provides that the Secretary
will identify those contracting entities that will be subject to coverage under section 224(g) in notices issued
pursuant to &sect;6.5.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In addition to the entity itself, section 224(g) provides that certain individuals may be covered under the FTCA.
Officers and employees are subject to coverage, as well as certain contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;501 provides that an individual may be considered to be a contractor of an entity described in
Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 only if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) the individual normally performs on average at least 321/2 hours of service per week for the entity for the period
of the contract; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) in the case of an individual who normally performs on average less than 321/2 hours of services per week for the entity
for the period of the contract and is a licensed or certified provider of obstetrical services_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the individual's medical malpractice liability insurance coverage does not extend to services performed by
the individual for the entity under the contract; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the Secretary finds that patients to whom the entity furnishes services will be deprived of obstetrical services
if such individual is not considered a contractor of the entity for purposes of paragraph (1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coverage of individuals, whether employees of contractors, does not extend to acts or omissions that are not related
to the grant supported activity. The covered entity itself (assuming it meets the statutory requirements for FTCA
coverage) will be covered for claims against it, even if an individual health care practitioner is not covered in a
particular case. Thus, for example, if a contractor works fewer than 321/2 hours and is not a provider of obstetrical
services, the contractor would not be covered for services related to the grant, but the grantee itself would be covered.

IV. Covered Acts and Omissions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposed &sect;6.6 provides elaboration on the scope of the statutory protection for covered entities and individuals.
Paragraph (a) states the relevant dates of coverage. Paragraph (b) repeats the provision of section 224(a) that limits
coverage to claims for damage for personal injury or death resulting from the performance of medical, surgical, dental,
or related functions. Paragraph (c) states that for covered individuals, only acts or omissions within the scope
of their employment (or contract for services, in the case of covered contractors) are covered. Thus, for example,
``moonlighting'' activities of a physician employed by a covered grantee would not be covered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;6.6 addresses the limitation that only acts or omissions related to the grant-supported
activity are covered. The Department is aware that there has been some confusion since the enactment of section 224(g)
about the types of activities that would be covered. In particular, there have been questions about the issue of when
coverage is available where individuals who are not registered patients of the grantee are treated. This paragraph
provides clear standards for answering these questions. Coverage will be available for the treatment of non-patients
of the covered entities only when the Secretary determines either that (1) the provision of the services to such individuals
benefits patients of the entity and general populations that could be served by the entity through community-wide
intervention efforts within the communities served by the entity, or (2) the provision of services to such individuals
facilitates the provision of services to patients of the entity, or (3) such services are otherwise required to be
provided to such individuals under an employment contract or similar arrangement between the entity and the covered
individual. Examples of situations within the scope of proposed &sect;6.6(d) are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A community health center deemed to be a covered entity establishes a school-based or school-linked health
program as part of its grant supported activity. Even though the students treated are not necessarily registered
patients of the center, the center and its health care practitioners will be covered for services provided, if the
Secretary makes the determination in subparagraph (1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A migrant health center requires its physicians to obtain staff privileges at a community hospital. As a condition
of obtaining such privileges, and thus being able to admit the center's patients to the hospital, the physicians must
agree to provide occasional coverage of the hospital's emergency room. The Secretary would be authorized to determine
that this coverage is necessary to facilitate the provision of services to the grantee's patients, and that it would
therefore be covered by subparagraph (2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A homeless health services grantee makes arrangements with local community providers for after-hours coverage
of its patients. The grantee's physicians are required by their employment contracts to provide periodic cross-coverage
for patients of these providers, in order to make this arrangement feasible. The Secretary may determine that the
arrangement is within the scope of subparagraph (3). Again, however, it should be understood that this would not extend
the scope of coverage under Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 to ``moonlighting'' activities by center health care practitioners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule is not intended to constitute, and does not constitute, a comprehensive notice pertaining to any
provision of Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 except to the extent that procedures pertaining to implementation of Pub. L. 102&hyph;501
are described explicitly above. The applicability of Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 and 42 U.S.C. 233(a) to a particular claim
or case will depend upon the determination or certification (as appropriate) by the Attorney General that the individual
or entity is covered by Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 and was acting within the scope of employment, in accordance with normal
Department of Justice procedures. A determination or certification by the Attorney General is subject to judicial
review.

Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires that all regulations reflect consideration of alternatives, of costs, benefits,
incentives, equity, and availability of information. Regulations which are ``significant'' because of cost, adverse
effects on the economy, inconsistency with other agency actions, effects on the budget, or novel legal or policy issues,
require special analysis. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires that we include an analysis
of all rules the significantly impact small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations provide information whereby health care entities or individual scan determine when,
and to what extent they are likely to be protected for medical malpractice under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).
Therefore, the Secretary certifies that the proposed regulations will not have a significant effect on a substantial
number of small entities.

forth changes necessitated by enactment of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA) Reorganization
Act, and to make other changes necessary to update the regulations.

Section 122 of the ADAMHA Reorganization Act, Public Law 102&hyph;321, which was enacted on July 10, 1992, transferred
Public Health Service (PHS) Act section 511, National Alcohol Research Center, to Title IV, Part C, Subpart 14 of the
Act, and redesignated the section as PHS Act section 464J. Under PHS Act section 464J, the Secretary, acting through
the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), may designate National Alcohol Research Centers
for the purpose of interdisciplinary research relating to alcoholism and other biomedical, behavioral and social
issues related to alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and shall make annual grants to the Centers, including a grant to a
designated Center for research on the effects of alcohol on the elderly. The NIH proposes to amend the current regulations
governing these grants by revising the ``Table of Contents'' section, removing reserved sections 54a.508 and 54a.509,
and redesignating section 54a.510 as 54a.508, revising the authority citation and ``Applicability'' section to
show the changes necessitated by enactment of the ADAMHA Reorganization Act, providing additional definitions,
replacing the language in section 54a.504 with non-specific language which will eliminate the need to seek OMB regulatory
review for future changes in the grant application form, and revise section 54a.506(c) by removing the $1 million
limitation on grant awards to conform to Public Law 98&hyph;24 which eliminated the $1 million cap. Additionally,
NIH proposes to add a new section 54a.509 to the current regulations setting forth other HHS policies and regulations
that apply to grants awarded under subpart E. The purpose of this notice is to invite public comment on these proposed
changes. The following statements are provided for the information of the public.

Regulatory Impact Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this rule merely makes minor changes in grant application practices and conforms grant awards to the current
statute, it will have no consequential effects on the economy or small entities. Therefore the Secretary has determined
that this rule is not significant within the definition of Executive Order 12866, and the Secretary certifies that
this rule will not have a significant impact on a substential number of small entities.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice of proposed rulemaking would amend the regulations concerning the U.S. Repatriate Program. The proposed
rule would require agencies which provide assistance to groups of United States citizens who are returned from foreign
countries to the United States by the Department of State due to war, threat of war, civil disorder, or natural disaster
to request and obtain advance approval from the Administration for Children and Families to incur expenses for developing
and preparing to implement repatriation plans for groups of eligible persons. This action is necessary in order for
the Department to appropriately oversee the limited funding available for such activities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The U.S. Repatriate Program is authorized by Section 1113 of the Social Security Act and is responsive to Executive
Order 12656 regarding services provided to repatriated U.S. citizens. The program provides temporary assistance
to needy U.S. citizens and their dependents who are returned to the United States by the Department of State for reasons
of destitution, illness, war, threat of war, invasion, civil unrest, or natural disaster. Under current law and regulations,
assistance provided through the program to repatriates must be repaid to the United States Government unless the
Assistant Secretary for Children and Families specifically waives this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Group Repatriation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
When groups of U.S. citizens and their dependents must be evacuated from foreign countries and returned to the United
States due to war, threat of war, invasion, civil unrest, or natural disaster, States administer the necessary reception
and assistance. These repatriation events are generally referred to as Group Repatriations. In the event that the
President declares a national security emergency, Executive Order 12656, ``Assignment of Emergency Preparedness
Responsibilities,'' requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate such a repatriation. This
type of group repatriation is referred to as Emergency Repatriation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to E.O. 12656, the U.S. Repatriate Program has developed a National Emergency Repatriation Plan which
calls for States to develop their own Emergency Repatriation Plans. Under these plans, the States provide for the
logistical arrangements for receiving U.S. citizens repatriated as part of a declared national security emergency
and providing assistance for their travel to their final destinations and other necessities to ensure the immediate
welfare of the repatriates. These plans are activated upon the request of the Department if, and only if, the President
declares a national security emergency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the States' Emergency Repatriation Plans are suitable for use in the event that groups of American citizens
are evacuated due to war or threat of war, invasion or other civil violence, or natural disaster_but a national security
emergency is not declared under Executive Order 12656_the U.S. Repatriate Program recognizes that States could
use these plans as both Emergency Repatriation Plans and Group Repatriation Plans, and encourages them to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Administrative Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The statutory authority, as well as the current regulations, provide for States or other agencies providing repatriation
assistance to be reimbursed for their administrative expenses. Since group/emergency repatriations are a relatively
rare event, the Department wishes to ensure that the amount of administrative expenses incurred by States in planning
or preparing for receiving group repatriations is reasonable and appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To this end, we are proposing that if States wish to be reimbursed for their administrative expenses, they must seek
and receive prior approval from the Department before incurring expenses associated with developing group/emergency
repatriation plans. States must also receive prior approval to be reimbursed for the costs of preparing to implement
the plans, such as conducting training exercises or making physical preparations to a reception site, unless notified
by the Department that such preparations are necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to keep administrative requirements to a minimum, we are not proposing to mandate any particular format for
States to request approval. In submitting a written request for administrative expenses in advance of incurring
costs, a State may use any format the State desires. States should include an estimate of the expenses they will incur,
along with a description of the activities to be undertaken and a rationale for the expenditure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Departmental review of the request will consist of (1) determining if the activities are, in fact, necessary, and
(2) evaluating whether the estimated cost is reasonable for the activities to be conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing to make technical changes throughout 45 CFR part 212 to update references to the office's designation
and the agency official's title.

Regulatory Procedures

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Public Law 96&hyph;354) requires the Federal Government to anticipate and reduce
the impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary impact of this rule is on State governments. Therefore, we certify that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it would simply require agencies to obtain advance
approval from the Administration for Children and Families before incurring administrative costs in developing
implementation plans for the repatriation of groups of eligible individuals. Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis
is not required.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities
and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department determined that this rule is consistent with these
priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including
not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome
while still achieving the regulatory objectives.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed amendment would require States to submit information regarding their activities and estimated costs
for Departmental approval prior to the incurring of administrative expenses for planning and implementing group/emergency
repatriation procedures. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) has been requested.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA proposes to amend the railroad accident reporting rules in several ways. First, FRA would require railroads to
adopt internal control procedures to ensure accurate reporting of accidents, casualties, and highway-rail grade
crossing accidents. Second, FRA would allow railroads to submit and update accident, casualty, and highway-rail
accident reports through transfer of information on computer diskettes or magnetic tapes. Third, FRA would revise
the accident and injury reporting forms, including definitions. Fourth, FRA would revise injury and illness, as
well as derailment and collision, recordkeeping requirements. Finally, FRA would revise the method by which it will
determine and periodically adjust the accident reporting threshold.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Purpose and Structure of the Accident Reporting Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA's primary function is to promote safety within the railroad industry. To carry out its safety mission, FRA needs
information about the conditions of the nation's railroads to enforce safety regulations and to develop railroad
injury and accident prevention programs. The injury and accident reports submitted by the railroads form a principal
basis for FRA's railroad safety program. FRA uses injury and accident data for, among other things, establishing
its inspection strategy, determining comparative trends of railroad safety, and calculating the costs and benefits
of proposed safety rules. Because FRA uses the data in all aspects of its operations, it is important that the data it
receives be as accurate and consistent as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The railroad accident reporting regulations set forth in 49 CFR part 225 require railroads to submit monthly reports
to FRA summarizing collisions, derailments, and certain other accidents/incidents involving damages above a periodically
revised dollar threshold, as well as certain injuries to passengers, employees, and other persons on railroad property.
The regulations presently define an ``accident/incident'' in &sect;225.5(b) as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any impact between railroad on-track equipment and an automobile, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, farm vehicle
or pedestrian at a rail-highway grade crossing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other event involving operation of railroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on-track equipment (standing or moving) that results in more than $6,300 in damages to railroad on-track equipment,
signals, track, track structures, and roadbed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any event arising from the operation of a railroad which results in: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Death of one or more persons; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Injury to one or more persons, other than railroad employees, that requires medical treatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Injury to one or more employees that requires medical treatment or results in restriction of work or motion for
one or more days, one or more lost work days, transfer to another job, termination of employment, or loss of consciousness;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Occupational illness of a railroad employee as diagnosed by a physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 225.19 of the regulations presently divides railroad accidents/incidents into three categories: (1) highway-rail
grade crossing accidents/incidents; (2) rail equipment accidents/incidents; and (3) death, injury, or occupational
illness accidents/incidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Every railroad accident/incident meeting the stated criteria for each category must be reported to FRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49 CFR 225.11. Because the reporting requirements and the information needed regarding each category of accident/incident
are unique, a different reporting form is used for each category. If the circumstances of an accident/incident are
such that it falls within two or even all three categories, then a separate reporting form for each category must be
completed by the railroad. For example, if a highway-rail grade crossing accident involves damage to rail equipment
over the current reporting threshold of $6,300, then both a ``Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report''
(Form FRA F 6180.57) and a ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54) must be completed by the
reporting railroad. (In order to conform to the grade crossing signal system safety regulations in part 234, the term
``rail-highway'' will be changed to read ``highway-rail'' throughout part 225. This NPRM will hereinafter refer
to ``highway-rail'' grade crossings.) Further, if injuries are associated with the crossing accident, then the
monthly ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55a) must also be completed.

B. General Accounting Office Study on Accident Reporting to FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Increasingly concerned with railroad safety, Congress asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to determine whether
FRA's safety programs were adequate to protect railroad employees and the general public from injuries associated
with train accidents. GAO studied FRA's railroad injury and accident reporting data and issued a report (GAO/RCED&hyph;89&hyph;109)
that raised important questions about the quality of railroad compliance with FRA's accident reporting regulations.
GAO found that there was underreporting and inaccurate reporting of injury and accident data for 1987 by the railroads
it audited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAO recommended that FRA (a) Require railroads to establish injury and accident reporting internal control procedures,
(b) include an analysis of railroads' internal control procedures for reporting in FRA's safety records inspections,
(c) provide inspectors with the authority to take enforcement actions against railroads with deficient internal
control procedures, (d) require railroads to update reports on workdays lost due to injuries, and (e) clarify FRA's
requirement for railroads to update accident reports when significant changes occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA's subsequent analysis of the findings from the 1989 GAO accident and injury reporting audit indicated that most
of the missing accident reports were ``fender benders'' and that the unreported injuries were minor. Nonetheless,
the accuracy of FRA's safety databases are of paramount importance, and FRA took several actions to improve railroads'
accident and injury reporting.

C. Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Accident Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 14, 1990, FRA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) soliciting comments and suggestions
from the public regarding methods of improving FRA's injury and accident reporting system and its governing regulations
(55 FR 9469). Interested parties were invited to participate in a public hearing held on May 17, 1990, and to file written
comments prior to May 25, 1990. The responses to that public notice provided additional information and identified
further issues and subissues related to the matters in the ANPRM. In order to further explore matters related to the
accident/incident reporting system, FRA held informal, open meetings on June 13, 1991, August 22, 1991, and August
18, 1992, in Washington, D.C., with members of the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Committee for Uniformity
in Reporting. At the request of rail labor representatives, FRA also held an informal, open meeting on October 21,
1991, in Washington, D.C., to discuss the same issues with representatives of various rail unions.

Discussion of Comments and Section Analysis

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to testimony from five organizations at the May 17, 1990 hearing, FRA received comments in response to
the ANPRM from over 15 parties including several railroads, railroad unions, railroad trade associations, as well
as two States. Discussions follow with respect to the primary issues addressed by the commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Internal Control Procedures (Proposed &sect;225.33) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, GAO concluded that erroneous injury and accident reporting occurred primarily because the railroads
it studied lacked adequate internal procedures for properly classifying and reporting the events. GAO believed
that under a system of self-reporting such as the one FRA uses to obtain railroad safety data, internal control procedures
would be necessary to ensure that reliable and accurate data is obtained, maintained, and disclosed by the railroads.
GAO recommended that FRA mandate such internal control procedures, periodically review them, and then use its enforcement
authority to cite railroads for procedural deficiencies when inaccurate reporting is found and the cause can be attributed
to internal control weakness.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of the five railroads GAO visited, the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (``CNW'') was found to have
the most effective internal control procedures for updating injury and accident information prior to reporting
to FRA. CNW's procedures involved extensive communication between its safety office, which reports accident information
to FRA, and other departments within the railroad. CNW also centralized its reporting responsibilities and updated
injury and accident information before reporting to FRA. Specifically, (a) CNW's safety office and claim office
met once a month to compare lists of injuries; (b) CNW used a ``15-day'' report (this report accurately disclosed the
severity of each injury) to update the status of each injury before reporting it to FRA; (c) for train accidents, initial
field estimates of property damage were compared with repair shop estimates before submitting a report to FRA; and
(d) CNW required a final accident report to its safety office within 20 days following the accident to allow for further
updating of information on the accident/incident report and the identification of additional reportable events
prior to filing a report with FRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the ANPRM, comments were solicited as to whether FRA should require railroads to implement specific internal control
procedures to assure proper reporting or simply establish strict performance standards and hold railroads accountable
for accuracy of the submitted data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most commenters did not support mandated internal control procedures, primarily because each railroad is different
organizationally. Since internal control procedures would be adapted to the organizational structures of individual
railroads, most commenters felt it would be unreasonable to prescribe a rigid set of rules governing the audit function
for universal application. Instead, it was proposed that each railroad submit their own internal control procedures
to FRA for review and subsequent approval. FRA would then have the ability to audit the railroad based upon the railroad's
own operating plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One labor association suggested that internal control procedures that ensure accurate information should be mandated
by FRA. It was proposed that this could be accomplished by requiring the railroads to update all initial information
within a certain time period; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
after filing the initial monthly report, the railroad would be required to supplement any and all changes that existed
at the time of filing the initial report within a specified time frame. It was also recommended that railroads should
file an annual report that would supplement each monthly report and that the railroads' reporting information be
crosschecked with accident data obtained from the Railroad Retirement Board and the Travelers Insurance Company.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One railroad association recommended that, if adopted, internal control procedures should apply initially to only
the larger railroads (Class I railroads). It was further suggested that regulations crafted particularly for smaller
railroads should be adopted in order to reduce the inequities that such railroads seemingly confront when implementing
safety regulations in general. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One railroad opined that FRA should require railroads to implement some specific internal control procedures, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, reporting data should be validated by at least one other internal railroad department source. As an alternative
to specific, prescribed procedures, it was recommended that railroads develop and file an ``action plan'' describing
how the railroad would validate its data with another impartial internal source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters did not support GAO's recommendation for civil penalties for inaccurate reporting due to internal
control weakness. A few stated that civil penalties should be assessed only for violations that are recurring, willful,
or grossly negligent.

Section Analysis and FRA Conclusions (Proposed &sect;225.33) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA's Operating Practices inspectors have significantly increased the amount of time spent reviewing railroad
accident reporting records. The internal control procedures of all the large railroads and a sampling of the small
railroads have been reviewed and analyzed by these inspectors and the results compared with GAO's earlier findings.
FRA found that these railroads have generally improved their internal control procedures and their accident/incident
reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA's recent review of the accident/incident reporting procedures of all of the major railroads and a large number
of smaller railroads supports the GAO findings that errors in reporting resulted principally from the railroads'
lack of internal control procedures. Railroads with specific internal control procedures in place had far more accurate
reporting records. FRA also found that most non-reporting or inaccurate reporting was due to a communication breakdown
between the claims department, which maintained medical records, and the other railroad departments, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, operating, mechanical, and maintenance-of-way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA therefore proposes, in new &sect;225.33(a), that each railroad must prepare and maintain an Internal Control
Plan, that requires institution of proper internal control procedures for reporting. Such a Plan would ensure the
reconciliation and incorporation of accident/incident and injury/illness data from the various departments within
the railroad for submission to the railroad reporting officer. The reporting office must have access to all pertinent
claims records, including medical records and payroll records. Further, the reporting office must be notified by
claims and medical departments of each new case/claim opened by a railroad worker. Identification of offices and
responsible railroad officers would also aid FRA in identification of procedural weaknesses in reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA believes that requiring railroads to establish an Internal Control Plan for reporting would ensure more accurate
injury and accident reporting. Once in place, FRA inspections would focus on the procedures the railroads use to report
injuries and accidents. This periodical review of the Plan by FRA would detect procedural deficiencies and would
enable the railroad to correct any identified problems. Thus, new &sect;225.33(b) proposes that each railroad not
only have an Internal Control Plan, but also that all reasonable effort is made to adhere to that Plan. If FRA should
find the railroad to be in noncompliance, FRA may cite that railroad for violating procedural requirements and require
the railroad to correct the procedural weakness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this NPRM proposes, in new &sect;225.41, that the Internal Control Plan shall, upon request, be made
available to any FRA or State safety inspector for examination and photocopying in a reasonable manner during normal
business hours. Proposed &sect;225.41 is discussed in greater detail in this NPRM under the heading ``Miscellaneous
Amendments.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to resolve the discrepancies between the annual report for lost workdays and the monthly submission of lost
workdays, FRA began in January 1990 to allow the railroads to update their portion of the accident and casualty database
using magnetic media. In this NPRM, the term ``magnetic media'' means computer diskettes and magnetic tapes. Currently,
railroads are allowed to update certain fields on existing records (``Days Lost,'' ``Restricted Days,'' ``Cause
Code,'' ``Alcohol and Drug Code,'' ``Damages,'' ``Total Injuries,'' and ``Total Killed''). New submissions must
be submitted on existing paper forms as existing provisions of part 225 do not allow transfer of data by means of magnetic
media as an alternative means of compliance. Updating the information via a magnetic medium remained voluntary on
the part of the railroad, and this procedure, along with paper form updates, has improved the overall accuracy of information
submitted monthly particularly with respect to the number of lost workdays.

Comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA solicited comments in the ANPRM regarding a proposal to allow railroads the option to report accidents/incidents
by way of magnetic media transfer in lieu of the paper (``hard copy'') forms currently submitted. Most commenters
expressed an interest in implementing some kind of electronic transmission and exchange of data from the railroads
to FRA. One railroad suggested that FRA implement the program to ensure timely and accurate changes to the hard copy
``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54), rather than submitting a corrected hard copy
report. Another railroad emphasized that implementation of a magnetic media program was a concept long overdue and
predicted a reduction in the amount of annual key-punching labor cost. One rail association encouraged implementation
of a magnetic media program as it would ensure timely reporting and a less expensive medium than submission of hard
copies. It was also suggested that FRA should provide smaller railroads the appropriate software for their personal
computers. Another railroad recommended that FRA review the feasibility of reporting accidents/incidents telephonically
as well as by magnetic media. In reference to the initial cost to implement the program, the majority of the railroads
anticipated a one-time start-up cost which would be necessary to implement the data transfer process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the favorable responses to the ANPRM, FRA proposes, in new &sect;225.37, to amend the current reporting
requirements and allow railroads the option of using magnetic media to transmit both the initial and updated versions
of the following reports: (a) the ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54), (b) the ``Railroad
Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55a), and (c) the ``Highway-Rail Grade Crossing
Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.57). Reporting requirements for magnetic media transfer would be similar
to the current hard copy reporting requirements currently stated in &sect;225.11; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, reports submitted via magnetic media would be due within 30 days after expiration of the month in which the accident/incident
occurred.

, National Institute of Standards and Technology XII Standard) electronic data interchange (EDI), whereby accident
and incident data would be available to FRA in a short time period, is not only too expensive for the railroads to implement
but also inefficient for the types of files that would be transferred to FRA. In order for FRA to effectively assess
any modem-to-modem (computer-to-computer) private format EDI submission of accident and incident reports, many
more railroads will need to submit their data on magnetic media. A decision on use of modem-to-modem submissions of
accident/incident reports would be made once FRA gauges (a) the number of submissions by railroads willing to take
part in this voluntary program and (b) the size (number of characters) of the submissions. In order to accomplish this,
FRA will carefully monitor and assess all initial magnetic media submissions supplied by the railroads choosing
the magnetic media option.

Computer Magnetic Media Transfer Option (Proposed &sect;225.37(a)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In particular, FRA proposes, in new &sect;225.37(a), to allow the railroads, subject to various conditions, the
option to submit magnetic media that contain: (a) initial accident/incident reports, (b) updates or amendments
to all reports previously submitted in hard copy, and (c) updates or amendments to reports initially transmitted
on magnetic media. Railroads would be allowed to provide FRA with magnetic media in the form of either a magnetic tape
(EBCDIC) fixed format, an ASCII diskette-fixed format, a DBF diskette, or a delimited diskette. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The magnetic media option also would allow railroads to continue to submit hard copy reports, as the current regulations
require, but to update the data contained on the hard copy by way of magnetic media. Alternatively, railroads would
have the option to utilize magnetic media exclusively for all initial reports and all updates and amendments to those
reports. Further, all transmissions of updated or amended reports by means of magnetic media would be added to a year-to-date
file created exclusively for each reporting railroad. This year-to-date file would include all updates and amendments
on reported accidents and incidents and would be maintained by FRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Railroads that choose to submit their data via magnetic media would remain responsible for having on file hard copies
of the reports identified in &sect;225.21. Therefore, FRA proposes, in new &sect;225.27(c), that each railroad
must maintain on file, at a central location(s) designated by the railroad, a signed copy of both the ``Rail Equipment
Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54) and the ``Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Form FRA F 6180.57), as well as a copy of all other reports filed with FRA. This requirement is also meant to include
a hard copy of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 record submitted via magnetic media. Maintaining files at an identified central location would enable both federal
and State inspectors, as well as authorized representatives, a means by which to verify whether the railroad reported
a specific accident/incident or injury to FRA.

Computer Magnetic Media Transfer Requirements (Proposed &sect;225.37(b)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposes, in new &sect;225.37(b), to require that when a railroad utilizes the magnetic media option, whether
to submit an initial report, or an updated or amended report, it shall submit along with the magnetic media: (a) a sworn
report, as required by 49 U.S.C. 20901 (formerly contained at &sect;1 of the Accident Reports Act, 45 U.S.C. 38), in
the form of a notarized ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (Form FRA F 6180.55), and (b) a signed ``Batch Control
Form'' for magnetic media. The requirement to submit a notarized Form FRA F 6180.55 would ensure that railroad reporting
officials attest to the validity of the information reported to FRA in the magnetic media and would provide FRA with
evidence necessary to hold those officials accountable for false reporting. The ``Batch Control Form'' for magnetic
media, also signed by the railroad's reporting officer, would describe the type of report, number of reports, persons
injured, rail damage, lost workdays, etc., for each type of accident/incident reported on the magnetic media. By
signing the ``Batch Control Form,'' the railroad reporting official would attest that the data contained in the magnetic
media agrees with the data forwarded by the railroads in Forms FRA F 6180.54, 6180.55a, and 6180.57. FRA proposes to
print the ``Batch Control Form'' on the back of the ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (FRA Form F 6180.55). The
format of the proposed ``Batch Control Form'' is set forth in Appendix 1 to this NPRM.

Computer Magnetic Media Assimilation Period (Proposed &sect;225.37(c)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the magnetic media option is a fairly new concept, FRA proposes, in new &sect;225.37(c), to require the railroads
that utilize this medium to initially include the hard copy of the particular accident/incident report with the magnetic
media. During this assimilation period, FRA will compare the data on hard copy reports to the data contained in the
magnetic media to determine if the information reported via magnetic media is consistent and reliable. This requirement
would ensure quality control and would provide FRA a measure by which to gauge accurate reporting. After a three-month
period of 100-percent accuracy verification, FRA will notify the railroad that the hard copy is no longer necessary.
Of course, this process may take longer than three months if the hard copy reports do not agree with the magnetic media
submission. If the data in the hard copy is inconsistent with the data in the magnetic media, FRA may require that particular
railroad to continue to submit hard copies until both the hard copy and the magnetic media reflect the same information.
Once the data on both the hard copies and magnetic media agree, FRA will notify the railroad reporting official to discontinue
submitting hard copies. However, there would always remain the requirement that railroads submit a hard copy notarized
Form FRA F 6180.55 as well as the signed hard copy ``Batch Control Form.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA believes that providing the magnetic media transfer option for reporting accidents/incidents would ensure
faster, more accurate reporting by railroads. The initial start-up cost to railroads is expected to be minimal. FRA
would provide initial computer diskettes and technical advice to railroads that use the option. Moreover, railroads
would be provided with the opportunity to correct or amend the hard copy reports or initial reports in magnetic media
within the 30-day reporting period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA received a multitude of comments regarding the currently used reporting forms. In general, it was recommended
that all forms be revised to reflect recent regulatory changes and new operating practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned previously, FRA has had open informal meetings with the AAR Committee for Uniformity in Reporting. The
American Short Line Railroad Association (ASLRA) representing the small railroad industry as well as counsel for
the Railway Labor Executives' Association (RLEA) were in attendance at these open meetings. These meetings detailed
changes in cause codes for train accidents and expansion of the illness codes. Suggestions were also made to restructure
the ``FRA Guide for Reporting Accidents/Incidents'' (``FRA Guide''). It was suggested that FRA should develop easy-to-follow
directions for any new reporting requirements. Most of the changes were studied by FRA and implemented in 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Below is a discussion of each reporting form followed by recommended changes to that form.

1. Form FRA F 6180.45_``Annual Summary Report of Railroad Injury and Illness'': Elimination of This Form and Transfer
of Certain Information Blocks to Other Forms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Form FRA F 6180.45 has been used by the rail industry to report all deaths, injuries, and occupational illnesses of
on-duty railroad employees that occurred during the calendar year. 49 CFR 225.21(f). FRA proposes to eliminate the
requirement for submission of the ``Annual Summary Report of Railroad Injury and Illness'' (Form FRA F 6180.45) for
the reasons set forth below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original instructions for reporting required railroads to make a ``good faith'' estimate of the number of days
a worker was expected to be absent from work or on restricted duty following an injury or occupational illness. The
annual report filed with the December submission was used to provide a summary total of the actual number of such days.
FRA then used the reported information on individual incidents for its analyses. Because the total count of days found
on the annual report cannot be assigned to individual cases, FRA found it necessary to amend its instructions several
years ago to require railroads to provide an update for any case where the count of days on the report filed with FRA varied
by more than ten percent from the actual count of such days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA accepts updates made on magnetic media, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, diskettes and tapes. Several railroads provide monthly updates in conjunction with the report for the current month
and must provide a final accounting by April 15 of the following year. With the exception of the column used to identify
terminations and permanent transfers, a duplicate of the breakdown of cases can be prepared by summarizing the individual
cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information regarding terminations or permanent transfers is currently found in column ``8'' on the annual summary
report. This column lists the number of cases in column ``3'' (Total Lost Workday Cases) and column ``7'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Non-fatal Cases Without Lost Workdays) that resulted in either the termination or the permanent transfer of the
employee for reasons related to the sustained injury or occupational illness. Because FRA proposes to eliminate
the requirement for submission of Form FRA F 6180.45, and since FRA deems the information under ``Terminations or
Transfers'' important for accurate injury and illness data analysis, FRA proposes to move the block designated ``Terminations
or Permanent Transfers'' over to block ``5v'' on the proposed ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation
Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55a). Moving this data block to Form FRA F 6180.55a would enable FRA to continue to collect
this relevant information while at the same time eliminating the requirement to complete the annual summary report
(Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.45). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reasons set forth above, FRA is proposing to move the blocks that solicit information on ``establishments
included in this report'' and ``average employment in reporting year'' on the annual summary report to the proposed
``Annual Railroad Report of Worker Hours and Casualties, by State'' (Form FRA F 6180.56).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

49 CFR 225.19(c) and 225.21(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments received in response to the ANPRM, FRA proposes to make limited changes to the ``Rail Equipment
Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54). The purpose of these proposed changes is to improve FRA's accident
analysis capability. The format of the proposed Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.54 is set forth in Appendix 2 to this NPRM. The currently used Form is provided in Appendix 3 for comparison and
reference purposes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special Study Blocks (SSB).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The first proposed change would be the establishment of three new blocks on Form FRA F 6180.54, each designated as a
``Special Study Block'' (SSB) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 item ``49'' on the proposed Form). Over the years, FRA and other agencies and associations have frequently wanted
to collect information on specific accident issues over a specified time period in response to particular risks of
immediate safety concern. Because of the difficult and time-consuming task of revising and receiving approval for
permanent changes to the reporting form, FRA has not been able to respond quickly in these situations and has had to
rely on labor-intensive field surveys by regional FRA personnel and the informal cooperation of the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes to establish three SSB's for the purpose of temporarily collecting information on these issues of immediate
safety concern. When one or more critical safety issues arise, FRA would notify the railroad reporting officers and
request that they, for a specified time-frame, collect and report on the critical issues using the SSB. Upon expiration
of the pre-defined time period, the SSB would not be used again until the next issues of immediate concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed changes to the reporting definitions for Form FRA F 6180.54 address perceived deficiencies and inconsistencies
regarding the area labelled ``PROPERTY DAMAGE'' on the current form in blocks ``33'' and ``34.'' The inconsistencies
result from a lack of clear direction to the industry on the issue of overhead and fringe expenses. Some railroads include
overhead and fringe expenses in their estimates of damage, some include one and not the other, some include neither,
and some may not even report the same way every time. These inconsistencies diminish the quality of the accident data
and taint any analysis of that data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA would like to improve the consistency of the information collected on damage costs. FRA proposes to make it clear
that when estimating damage costs, the labor costs to be reported are only the direct labor costs to the railroad, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, hourly wages, transportation costs, and hotel expenses. Thus, for example, the cost of fringe benefits would be

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
excluded
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 when calculating direct labor costs. This clarification should result in greater uniformity in reporting among
the railroads. For services performed by a contractor, the railroad would estimate a direct hourly labor cost by multiplying
the contractor's total labor hours charged to the railroad by the applicable direct hourly wage rate for a railroad
worker in that particular craft.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA also proposes to make it clear that overhead is to be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
excluded
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from damage costs. FRA does not wish to dictate a specific rate for overhead, but it also finds the non-uniform treatment
of overhead under the current process to be unacceptable. Rather than have damage estimates that have an unknown level
of overhead, FRA has decided to propose excluding overhead from the direct damage estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, material costs would be calculated based upon the costs of acquiring new material, even if the railroad chooses
to use refurbished or used material in their actual repairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the proposed changes in the reporting definitions would allow the industry maximum flexibility in cost
accounting and management, and would not dictate set practices to restrict that flexibility, but would require enough
disclosure of the practices used so that FRA could convert the information to common terms before any analysis is performed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Filing of an Amended Form FRA F 6180.54.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the time the ANPRM for accident reporting was published, the FRA Guide provided that Form FRA F 6180.54 was to be amended
if, after filing, it was determined that the damage estimate ``was significantly in error *&blank;*&blank;*.''
Since the term ``significantly'' was not defined in the FRA Guide at that time, railroads used varying definitions
of ``significant'' differences and, as a result, submitted few updated accident reports. Because of the doubt as
to the definition of the term, the majority of commenters proposed that ``significantly'' be defined as at least a
ten-percent change in the estimated or actual damages submitted to FRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments, the FRA Guide was changed to specifically provide that an amended report be filed only
if subsequently acquired information showed the damage to be at least a ten-percent variance from the amount originally
reported to FRA (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 page V&hyph;2 of the FRA Guide). This change became effective January 1, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Railroad Injury and Illness (Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55a) collects information about injuries,
fatalities, and illnesses of railroad workers, trespassers, contractors, and passengers and about highway-rail
grade crossing injuries and fatalities. 49 CFR 225.19(d) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
225.21(c). Only the barest of information is currently available on Form FRA F 6180.55a: the railroad reporting the
incident, the State in which the incident occurred, type of person injured or ill, age, type of injury or illness, what
the person was doing at the time of the incident, and, for railroad workers, the number of workdays lost and restricted
and the results of administered alcohol/drug tests. FRA does not believe the information currently requested on
Form FRA F 6180.55a is sufficient for analyzing the causal factors related to injuries and illnesses. FRA thus proposes
numerous changes to the Form in order to collect data that would aid in development of railroad injury and accident
prevention programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The format of the proposed Form FRA F 6180.55a is set forth in Appendix 4 to this NPRM. Appendix 5, the currently used

Exposure to hazardous materials.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When a railroad accident causes a release of hazardous materials, FRA cannot determine, using Form FRA F 6180.55a
as it now stands, if any injuries are associated with the hazardous materials release. There is an increased need for
information on the number of persons injured or killed due to exposure to hazardous materials. FRA thus proposes to
add an additional block ``5u'' on Form FRA F 6180.55a to collect data on the number of injuries, as well as type of injury
(

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When there is an injury that is not caused by a train accident or highway-rail grade crossing accident, FRA presently
cannot determine the county of the incident or the exact date of the incident since the current Form requires railroads
to report only the month, year, and State. Requiring the county in which the incident occurred in block ``5d'' will
assist FRA safety inspectors in determining which sites or railroad shops have more injuries or illnesses. Requiring
the exact date, including the day of the month, in block ``5b'' and time of day in block ``5c'' will assist FRA safety
inspectors in records inspection. It will also assist the railroad industry in determining whether more accidents
occur on certain days or times of the week.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gender/ethnicity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA proposes requiring the gender and ethnicity of the person injured or ill in an effort to help identify whether particular
groups of individuals, particularly trespassers, are more susceptible than others to certain injuries and illnesses.
Language barriers or unfamiliarity with road signs, especially railroad crossing signs, may contribute to many
of the accidents that occur at highway-rail grade crossings. Submission of information on gender in block ``5h''
and ethnicity in ``5i'' would furnish FRA with the data relevant to demonstrate whether or not this is in fact the case.
If the data collected in these blocks showed that particular ethnic groups were more prone to certain injuries and
accidents, then FRA would attempt to identify what the exact problem is and then develop remedial programs or other
appropriate policies and procedures to prevent recurrence of such injuries and accidents in the future.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Circumstance codes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When there is an injury that is not associated with a rail equipment accident, the only information about the incident
currently collected is (i) what the person was doing at the time of the incident and (ii) the type of injury. This is not
sufficient data for safety analysis. For example, if an individual received an electric shock while using portable
power tools, there is no way to determine, under the current reporting system, whether the cause of the incident was
defective equipment, improper use of equipment, undesired contact with a power line or box, or some other circumstance
such as stepping on a power line. FRA needs to collect ``cause'' or ``circumstance'' codes for such injuries and illnesses.
FRA thus proposes to develop new codes, in addition to those currently used, to describe the cause and/or circumstance
of such incidents. Appendix 6 to this NPRM provides a list of the proposed circumstance codes that is to be used when
completing the ``Railroad Injury and Illness (Continuation Sheet).'' Specifically, these circumstance codes
would be used to complete the information in blocks ``5m_Physical Act,'' ``5n_Location,'' ``5o_Event,'' ``5p_Result,''
and ``5q_Cause.'' Appendix 6 is merely a preliminary sample of the list of circumstance codes and should not be considered
all-inclusive. The list of circumstance codes, once finalized, would be printed in the FRA Guide.

 As discussed earlier in the NPRM, FRA proposes to eliminate the requirement for submission of the ``Annual Summary
Report of Railroad Injury and Illness'' (Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.45). Data on terminations and permanent transfers is presently collected on Form FRA F 6180.45. In order to
continue to gather this data, FRA proposes collection of this information by the addition of block ``5v,'' entitled
``Terminations or Permanent Transfers,'' to Form FRA F 6180.55a.

 FRA also proposes the addition of a narrative block ``5w'' on Form FRA F 6180.55a that would allow the reporting railroad
the opportunity to provide details (up to 250 characters) on any unusual circumstance(s) surrounding the railroad
worker's injury or illness.

4. Form FRA F 6180.55_``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'': Limited Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (Form FRA F 6180.55) is used by the industry to summarize a railroad's
accidents/incidents for a given month. This report must be filed with FRA even when no accidents/incidents occurred
during the reporting month. 49 CFR 225.21(b). FRA proposes to make limited changes to this form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The format of the proposed Form FRA F 6180.55 is set forth in Appendix 7 to this NPRM. Appendix 8, the currently used ``Railroad
Injury and Illness Summary,'' is provided for comparison purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Classifications of persons. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FRA Guide currently classifies persons as: (i) ``Employees on Duty'' (Class A), (ii) ``Employees Not on Duty''
(Class B), (iii) ``Passengers on Trains'' (Class C), (iv) ``Non-Trespassers'' (Class D), (v) ``Trespassers'' (Class
E), and (vi) ``Contractor Employee'' (Class F). These ``person'' classifications are used by the reporting railroad
for completing the ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (Form FRA F 6180.55) and the ``Railroad Injury and Illness
(Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55(a)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes the addition of ``Non-Trespasser/Off Railroad Property'' (Class G) and ``Volunteer'' (Class H) to
the classes of persons and to replace the terms ``Employee on Duty'' and ``Employee Not on Duty'' with ``Worker on Duty''
and ``Worker Not on Duty,'' respectively. Additionally, the definition of a ``Worker on Duty'' would be expanded
to include individuals (including certain contractor employees and volunteers) who perform either (i) the operation
of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive activity for the reporting railroad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. New classification: ``Non-Trespasser/Off Railroad Property'' (Class G)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons, other than railroad employees, passengers, trespassers or contractor employees, who are injured while
on or adjacent to railroad property are currently coded as ``Non-Trespassers'' (Class D) on Form FRA F 6180.55a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For reporting purposes, FRA would like to distinguish between Non-Trespassers injured while on railroad property
and Non-Trespassers injured while off railroad property. FRA thus proposes to add a new classification of person
to cover those individuals (non-trespassers) who are injured while off railroad property. It should be noted that
an injury ``off railroad property'' would include an injury resulting from an event, such as a derailment or collision,
that begins on railroad property but ends on public or private non-railroad property, so long as the injury is incurred
while the person is physically located off railroad property. Similarly, if a derailment results in a release of hazardous
materials onto public or private non-railroad property and the hazardous material injures a ``Non-Trespasser''
located on public or private non-railroad property, the injury should be reported as an injury to a ``Non-Trespasser/Off
Railroad Property'' (Class G). ``Non-Trespasser/On Railroad Property'' (Class D) would be used to report injuries
and illnesses sustained by such non-trespassers while on railroad property.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. New Classifications: (i) ``Volunteer'' (Class H) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Volunteer or Contractor Employee Who Is Classified as a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Volunteer'' (Class H) would be added to the classes of persons, for purposes of completing Sections A and B on Form
FRA F 6180.55. ``Volunteer'' (Class H) would be defined to include an individual who willingly performs a service
for the reporting railroad, who does not receive direct monetary compensation from that railroad, and who is not engaged
in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive function for the reporting railroad.
Injuries or illnesses sustained by such a volunteer would be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a as injuries to a ``Volunteer''
(Class H). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, injuries or illnesses sustained by an individual, including a ``volunteer'' or ``contractor employee,''
who is engaged in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive function for the
railroad, would be reported as injuries/illnesses to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) and ``Worker Not on Duty'' (Class B) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) would be defined as an individual who receives direct monetary compensation from the
railroad and who is engaged in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive function
for the railroad. ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) and ``Worker Not on Duty'' (Class B) would replace the presently used
classification of persons ``Employee on Duty'' (Class A) and ``Employee Not on Duty'' (Class B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) would be subject to all of the applicable safety regulations in performance of his or
her activities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
drug and alcohol regulations, qualification and certification of locomotive engineers). When an individual is
engaged in ``mixed service,'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
performs both safety-sensitive functions and other functions, the railroad would report all the hours for that tour
of service as ``railroad worker hours'' in block ``15'' on the proposed Form FRA F 6180.55; and all reportable injuries
and illnesses would be reported as those to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) in block ``5f'' on the proposed Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.55a together with the applicable job code series of the service performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 209.303 describes ``safety-sensitive functions'' as applying to the following individuals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Railroad employees who are assigned to perform service subject to the Hours of Service Act (45 U.S.C. 61&hyph;64b)
during a duty tour, whether or not the person has performed or is currently performing such service, and any person
who performs such service;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A volunteer operates a locomotive for an excursion railroad. Since operation of a locomotive clearly falls within
the realm of operation of on-track equipment, the hours contributed to the railroad by the volunteer would be reported
as ``railroad worker hours'' on the ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (Form FRA F 6180.55). Likewise, if the
volunteer sustains a reportable injury during operation of the locomotive, then the incident would be reported on
the ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55a) as an injury to a ``Worker
on Duty'' (Class A), with the applicable job code series. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A volunteer sells memorabilia at a historic railroad. Since selling memorabilia does not fall within the scope of
either ``the operation of on-track equipment'' or ``any other safety-sensitive function,'' the hours contributed
by such a volunteer would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be reported as ``railroad worker hours'' and thus would not be reported on Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.55. When such a volunteer sustains a reportable injury, such injury, however, would be reported on Form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA F 6180.55a as an injury to a ``Volunteer'' (Class H). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A volunteer sells tickets for train rides on a tourist railroad and also clears vegetation adjacent to roadbed. Note
that the hours spent clearing the vegetation are reportable on Form FRA F 6180.55 as ``railroad worker hours'' because,
under 49 CFR 213.37, vegetation is to be cleared from the roadbed for safe rail operations and is thus considered a safety-sensitive
function. Any injury or illness sustained by the volunteer during the vegetation clearing would be classified as
one to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) with the applicable reporting requirements for purposes of Form FRA F 6180.55a.
The hours donated selling tickets would not ordinarily be reportable and, if any reportable injury was sustained
by the volunteer during the process of selling tickets, such injury would be classified as one to a ``Volunteer'' (Class
H). If, however, the volunteer sells tickets and then clears vegetation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
during the same tour, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
then all hours are reportable as ``railroad worker hours,'' and all injuries are considered as those attributable
to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A). Therefore, when an individual is engaged in ``mixed service,'' the railroad must
report all the hours for that tour of service as ``railroad worker hours'' on Form FRA F 6180.55; and all reportable
injuries and illnesses must be reported as those to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) on Form FRA F 6180.55a, with the applicable
job code series of the service performed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 4.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The employee of a contractor performs payroll as well as time-and-attendance functions for the railroad on railroad
property. Such functions are not considered safety-sensitive because they are not related to the continued safety
of the railroad. Thus, injuries sustained by this contractor performing those tasks would be reported on Form FRA
F 6180.55a as those attributable to a ``Contractor Employee'' (Class F). Further, the hours contributed by this contractor
would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be reported as ``railroad worker hours'' and thus would not be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A contractor employee inspects and replaces roller bearings for the reporting railroad. The hours worked by this
contractor employee performing this function would be reported as ``railroad worker hours'' on Form FRA F 6180.55,
and injuries sustained by this contractor would be reported as those to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) on Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.55a. Under 49 CFR 215.113, cars with defective roller bearings should not be in service, thus any activity associated
with replacement of roller bearings is a safety-sensitive function qualifying as hours attributable to a ``Worker
on Duty'' (Class A).

Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A summary of all hours worked by railroad employees during the report year is made on Form FRA F 6180.56 and is included
with the December submission. 49 CFR 225.21(d). FRA is proposing limited changes to this Form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information on ``establishments included in this report'' and ``average employment in reporting year,'' which
previously appeared on Form FRA F 6180.45, would be moved to Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.56 because, as discussed previously in this NPRM, FRA is proposing that Form FRA F 6180.45 be eliminated. In
addition, a column reflecting a count for ``casualties'' would be added to Form FRA F 6180.56. Therefore, the title
for Form FRA F 6180.56 would be revised to read ``Annual Railroad Report of Worker Hours and Casualties, by State.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The format of the proposed Form FRA F 6180.56 is set forth in Appendix 9 to this NPRM. Appendix 10, the currently used
``Annual Railroad Report of Manhours by State'' is provided for comparison purposes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Form FRA F 6180.57 collects information on accidents and incidents occurring at highway-rail grade crossings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any impact, regardless of severity, between a railroad on-track equipment consist and any user of a public or private
crossing site, including sidewalks and pathways, must be reported on this Form. 49 CFR 225.19(a) and 225.21(e). The
information collected on this report is vital to identifying and resolving problems at highway-rail grade crossings.

Comments

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA received several comments concerning Form FRA F 6180.57. Several commenters expressed concern over the question
asked in block ``32,'' which states, ``[w]as the signaled crossing warning identified in item 31 operating?'' Item
``31'' on the Form currently lists several types of signal devices, including active and passive devices. Confusion
arises when the person completing the report identifies a passive device and then reports that it was not operating.
To avoid this confusion, several commenters suggested that the question in item ``32'' be amended to request information
on whether the device was operating only if the device identified in item ``31'' was an active device. The Form also
makes a distinction between Amtrak and Autotrain in item one. Most commenters recommended elimination of this obsolete
distinction. A few commenters stated that the grade-crossing report required no change at all since the information
requested was adequate and not burdensome and that the Form itself was understandable.

Section Analysis and FRA Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The format of the proposed Form FRA F 6180.57 is set forth in Appendix 11 to this NPRM. Note that Appendix 12, the currently
used Form FRA F 6180.57, is provided for comparison purposes. In order to collect more information on motorists involved
in highway-rail grade crossing accidents, FRA proposes to amend Form FRA F 6180.57 to require information under the
heading ``Motorist,'' if known, on the motorist's age and gender, and whether the motorist was impaired by alcohol
or drugs at the time of the accident/incident (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
items ``39,'' ``40,'' and ``41'' on the proposed Form). Additionally, under the heading ``Highway Vehicle Property
Damage/Casualties'' on the currently used Form, FRA is proposing to delete blocks ``43'' through ``45,'' which request
information on the total number of occupants, and the total number of occupants killed and injured, and replace those
blocks with several new ones (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 items ``48'' through ``54'' on the proposed Form) to gather information on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) the number of highway-rail crossing users (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, pedestrians and vehicle occupants) killed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the number of highway-rail grade crossing users injured, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) the total number of highway-rail grade crossing users involved in the incident (including the driver), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) the number of railroad workers killed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) the number of railroad workers injured, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) the total number of people on the train at the time of the incident (including passengers and train crew), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) the number of train passengers killed, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) the number of train passengers injured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA also proposes to eliminate the distinction between Amtrak and Autotrain in item ``1'' as such a distinction is
obsolete. Additionally, FRA proposes to clarify the question in item ``32,'' ``[w]as the signaled crossing warning
working?'' FRA agrees that the ambiguity of this question has resulted in errors and problems because railroads report
obvious contradictions. The proposed instructions for completing this question (item ``33'' on the proposed Form)
are set forth in Appendix 13 to this NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA also proposes to add two new questions to the ``Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report'' to gather
information on whistle bans and signal system failure. New block ``34'' asks whether a whistle ban was in effect and
observed at the time of the accident/incident. New block ``35'' asks whether there was signal system failure within
the last seven calendar days up to and including the day of the accident. The codes for completing both items would be
included in the FRA Guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a new narrative block (item ``55'' on the proposed Form) allowing for up to 250 characters would be added
to the form in order to gather information on unusual causes/circumstances surrounding the highway-rail grade crossing
accident/incident.

7. Form FRA F 6180.78_``Notice to Railroad Worker Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Worker
Human Factor; Worker Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report'' (Revised Title): Limited Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a railroad should cite an employee human factor as the primary or contributing cause of a rail equipment accident/incident,
then current regulations require the reporting railroad to complete the ``Railroad Employee Human Factor Attachment''
(Form FRA F 6180.81), and attach it to the ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54). 49 CFR
225.12(a) and 225.21(g). Additionally, for each employee listed on Form FRA F 6180.81, the reporting railroad must
complete part I, ``Notice to Railroad Employee Involved In Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee
Human Factor,'' on Form FRA F 6180.78, and must provide a copy of this form to the worker within 45 days after the end of
the month in which the accident/incident occurred. 49 CFR 225.12(b) and 225.21(h). Upon receipt of Form FRA F 6180.78,
the worker has the option of providing a statement in part II (entitled ``Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad
Accident Report''). 49 CFR 225.12(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recipients of the notice (Form FRA F 6180.78) are to include only those railroad workers who were the primary cause
or a contributing cause of the rail equipment accident/incident. In order to minimize any confusion or misunderstanding
for recipients of the notice, FRA proposes refinement of the language in the block entitled ``Notice to Railroad Employee''
to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice to Recipient. An accident occurred on the above date which the railroad alleges was at least partially caused
by an action, lack of action, or the physical condition of a railroad worker. The railroad is sending you this notice
because it believes that you had a role, but may not necessarily be the primary or only person responsible for the accident's
occurrence. The railroad has reported to FRA that the primary and/or major contributing cause(s) of this accident
are those listed above. Other causal factors related to this event may be described in the narrative portion of the
railroad's report; a copy of which is attached.

Because FRA is proposing to replace ``employee'' with the term ``worker,'' the title of Form FRA F 6180.78 would be
revised to read ``Notice to Railroad Worker Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Worker Human
Factor; Worker Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report.'' Similarly, the title of Form FRA F 6180.81 would
be revised to read ``Worker Human Factor Attachment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log (Proposed Form FRA F 6180.xx and Proposed &sect;225.25(a)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 225.25(a) refers to the log of injuries and occupational illnesses at and for each railroad establishment.
It is silent as to whether an injury or illness has to be ``reportable'' to be included on the log. FRA has concluded that
in order to effectively enforce railroad injury reporting, the log must contain 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 injuries and illnesses to railroad workers that arise from the operation of the railroad. Unless FRA has the opportunity
to examine those injuries and illnesses deemed ``non-reportable'' as well as those deemed ``reportable'' by the
railroad, it is difficult for FRA to determine whether a railroad is properly making the ``reportable'' decision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, in order to accurately identify and review both reportable and non-reportable railroad injuries
and illnesses, FRA is proposing to amend &sect;225.25(a) to require that railroads maintain a log of all reportable
and non-reportable (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 recordable) injuries and illnesses to railroad workers for each railroad establishment using a new form entitled
``Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx). The format of the proposed ``Railroad Worker Injury
and Illness Log'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx) is set forth in Appendix 16 to this NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``recordable'' injury or illness is intended to encompass any condition, not otherwise reportable, of a railroad
worker that is associated with an event, exposure, or activity in the work environment that causes or requires the
worker to be examined or treated by a qualified health care professional. Such treatment would usually occur at a location
other than the work environment. The ``Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log'' would be maintained for each operational
railroad establishment, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
an establishment wherein workers report to work. The proposed log contains all the information currently required
under &sect;225.25(a). Requiring railroads to log injury and illness data on the new Form would help alleviate the
difficulty FRA inspectors encounter when attempting to locate injury and illness information at railroad establishments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Updating the Log (Proposed &sect;225.25(c)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Discrepancies in the log are the most recurring problems FRA inspectors encounter during an inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many railroads fail to update the log in a timely manner, particularly with respect to lost/restricted workdays.
Therefore, in order to assure that each railroad continuously updates the log (new Form), FRA proposes, in new &sect;225.25(c),
that each reportable and recordable (non-reportable) injury and illness be entered on the log as early as practicable,
but in any event no later than seven working days after receiving information that an illness or injury has occurred.
Additionally, new &sect;225.25(d) provides that if the log is maintained at a centralized location, but not through
electronic means, a paper copy of the log that is current within 35 days of the month to which it applies must be available
at the appropriate establishment. When the logs are maintained at a central location through electronic means, the
records for that establishment must be available for review in a hard copy format (paper printout) within four business
hours of the request. The ``Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log'' would also be used to prepare Form FRA F 6180.55a
and to update changes in the status of a particular case.

c. Elimination of supplementary record required under &sect;225.25(b). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA has found that much of the information requested in the supplementary record of injuries and illnesses pursuant
to the present regulation set forth in &sect;225.25(b) would be collected on the new ``Railroad Worker Injury and
Illness Log'' as proposed in &sect;225.25(a). Therefore, the requirement that each railroad maintain a supplementary
record, as currently required under &sect;225.25(b), would be eliminated.

d. Monthly list of injuries and illnesses (Proposed &sect;225.25(e)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 New &sect;225.25(e) proposes that each railroad maintain a list of all reported injuries and illnesses for the previous
month and that such list be posted in a conspicuous location at each railroad establishment within 30 days after expiration
of the month during which the injuries and illnesses occurred. For example, the monthly list of injuries and illnesses
for the month of May must be completed and posted no later than June 30th. Moreover, the monthly injury and illness list
would be displayed for a minimum of 60 consecutive days so as to allow all workers at that establishment the opportunity
to view the list. Given the example above, the list, if posted on June 30th, would remain posted for a minimum of 60 days,
or until August 30th. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;225.25(e)(1) outlines the data that would be included in the list. New &sect;225.25(e)(2) proposes
that if no reportable injuries or illnesses were associated with an establishment, the posting shall make reference
to that fact.

Employer notification (Proposed &sect;225.39(a) and Copy of ``Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log'' to worker
(Proposed &sect;225.39(b)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rail labor organizations have repeatedly expressed concern that many injured workers fail to inform their employers
of such injuries. By placing part of the burden for reporting on the individual railroad worker, FRA believes it could
improve the general quality of the injury/illness reporting data. Consequently, proposed &sect;225.39(a) would
require that railroad workers notify their employer, in writing, that they have an injury and/or illness within seven
calendar days of either incurring the injury or illness or obtaining knowledge that they incurred the injury or illness.
A railroad worker must notify his or her employer of both reportable injuries and illnesses and non-reportable, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ``recordable'' injuries and illnesses. As discussed previously in this NPRM, a ``recordable'' injury or illness
is intended to encompass any condition, not otherwise reportable, of a railroad worker that is associated with an
event, exposure, or activity in the work environment that causes or requires the worker to be examined or treated by
a qualified health care professional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another concern is that injured workers do not have the opportunity to review and verify the information on the accident/illness
report prior to submission of that report to FRA. FRA thus proposes, in new &sect;225.39(b), the requirement that
the reporting railroad must provide the railroad worker with a copy of the completed ``Railroad Worker Injury and
Illness Log'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx). FRA believes that the general quality of injury and illness data would improve
by allowing the worker to participate in the reporting process as set forth above.

Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Log (Proposed Form FRA F 6180.xx(a) and Proposed &sect;225.25(b)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the present time railroads are required to maintain a log of only reportable rail equipment accidents. Information
on non-reportable events can typically be found in ``unusual occurrence'' reports and ``morning reports'' that
are maintained at various locations by the railroad. However, there is no guarantee that all of those reports are either
available or complete. As a result, during routine accident/incident records inspections it is often difficult,
if not impossible, to identify the events that were determined by the railroad to be non-reportable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consequently, in order to accurately identify and review both reportable and certain non-reportable rail equipment
accident/incidents, FRA is proposing in new &sect;225.25(b) that railroads maintain a log similar to the injury/illness
log that railroads are now required to maintain pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;225.25(a) using a new form entitled ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Log'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx(a)) (attached
as Appendix 17). A ``recordable'' rail equipment accident/incident would encompass any event not otherwise reportable
involving the operation of on-track equipment that causes physical damage to either the on-track equipment or the
track upon which such equipment was operated and that requires the removal or repair of rail equipment before any rail
operations over the track can continue. A ``recordable'' rail equipment accident/incident, if not tended to, would
thus disrupt railroad service. A scrape or indentation to rail equipment, however, would not make a rail equipment/accident
``recordable'' if routine rail operations over the track can continue without such equipment being repaired or removed
from service.

Property Damage Estimate Worksheet and Record (Proposed Form FRA F 6180.xx(b)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Appendix 18, entitled ``Property Damage Estimate Worksheet and Record'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx(b)) is a proposed worksheet
that reporting railroads would use to determine costs associated with damage to (i) on-track equipment, (ii) signal
equipment, (iii) track, and (iv) track structures and roadbed, as well as (v) costs of equipment rental and operation.
These five cost categories would be totaled to derive the total accident cost. If the total accident cost meets or exceeds
the reporting threshold, then the total cost for ``damage to on-track equipment'' in ``Part A'' would be transferred
to ``block 25 (Equipment Damage)'' on the proposed ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Log'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx(a)).
Likewise, the total cost for ``damage to signal equipment,'' ``damage to track,'' and ``damage to track structures
and roadbed'' in ``Parts B, C, and D'' respectively, would be totaled and this amount would be transferred to ``block
26 (Track, Signal, Way &amp; Structure Damage)'' on the ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Log.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes to print the ``Property Damage Estimate Worksheet and Record'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx(b)) on back of the

E. Quarterly Accident Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA solicited comments in the ANPRM as to whether a quarterly report would result in more accurate accident data being
filed with FRA. There remains a problem in accurately reporting both equipment accidents and personal injuries.
Railroads submit detailed information on a monthly basis, and in some instances, only 30 to 60 days have elapsed since
the date of the accident/incident until the railroad's certified report is filed with FRA. This does not always provide
sufficient time for the railroads to gather and verify statistics on repair costs and lost workdays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These detailed monthly reports provide the data for FRA's annual Accident/Incident Bulletin. This annual Bulletin
summarizes all reportable railroad accidents/incidents that occurred during the previous calendar year. Monthly
reports are, to some extent, based on estimates rather than actual figures; therefore, the Accident/Incident Bulletin
also reflects estimated data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to remedy this problem and ensure more consistently accurate statistics, FRA considered requiring quarterly
accident reports covering the previous quarter's occurrences. This would provide at least 90 days (and up to 180 days
depending on when the accident occurred within the quarter) during which the railroad could obtain actual repair
data and lost workday information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters suggested that the monthly reports could serve as estimates, while a quarterly report could contain
the actual costs associated with accidents. Others recommended that the monthly report be eliminated and argued
that quarterly reports containing actual costs would reduce inaccuracies. It was further suggested that quarterly
reports should be required to contain a detailed report for incidents where damages exceeded $50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters believed that a requirement for quarterly reporting would not remedy any problems. They recommended
that the monthly reporting requirement should be retained and that railroads should provide quarterly updating
of lost workdays, restricted days, equipment damage, track damage, and other changes, via magnetic media. Others
suggested that the information contained in monthly reports together with the submission of the end-of-year report
is sufficient and that the addition of a quarterly report requirement would create additional work without a concomitant
increase in valuable information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, several railroads recommended that the deadline for submission of the annual report (Form FRA F 6180.45)
be moved from January 31 to March 31. They believed this modification would enable the railroads to reconcile their
actual figures with the estimated figures resulting in more accurate information.

Analysis and FRA Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA has concluded that substitution of quarterly reporting for monthly submission would result in very little additional
accuracy of figures on repair costs and lost workdays. There would continue to be estimates involved due to the lack
of completion of repairs or treatment, particularly the closer the incident to the submission date. Therefore, the
discrepancies between monthly figures and the annual summary figures would continue to exist.

FRA agrees that the addition of a quarterly report would create additional work without a concomitant increase in
valuable information. FRA believes that the revisions to the Forms, as proposed in this NPRM, would provide reliable
and consistent injury and accident data for safety analysis.

F. Reporting Threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1975, FRA has adjusted the reporting threshold every two years based on the prices of a market basket of railroad
labor and materials. The purpose of these adjustments has been to maintain comparability between different years
of data by having the threshold keep pace with accident costs so that each year the same groups of accidents are included
in the ``reportable'' accident counts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current system is flawed for several reasons. First, the adjustment for the upcoming two years is made based on
price levels for the previous year. This may be a good method for identifying what that previous year's threshold should
have been, but is not necessarily a good method for setting the next two years' threshold. Second, the threshold adjustment
has been performed only every two years instead of every year, so the comparability of annual statistics within the
two-year set is less than perfect. Third, the market basket used is not necessarily representative of the labor and
materials consumed in the aftermath of accidents ``at the margin''_those with damages just above or just below the
reporting threshold. Thus, changes in the prices of the market basket may not be a good indicator of changes in the costs
associated with accidents at the margin. Fourth, the data used to calculate the threshold adjustment (the market
basket prices) is collected directly from the railroad industry itself, rather than public sources, which may raise
the suspicion that the data may be self-serving. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress has given FRA some direction for modifying the procedure for calculating the threshold in 49 U.S.C. 20901(b)
(formerly contained at section 15(a) of the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;365)): ``[i]n
establishing or changing a monetary threshold for the reporting of a railroad accident or incident, *&blank;*&blank;*
damage cost calculations'' shall be based ``only on publicly available information obtained from (A) the Bureau
of Labor Statistics; or (B) another department, agency or instrumentality of the United States Government if the
information has been collected through objective, statistically sound survey methods or has been previously subject
to a public notice and comment process in a proceeding of a Government department, agency, or instrumentality.''
Congress allows an exception to this general rule only if the necessary data is not available from the sources described,
and only after public notice and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA solicited comments in the ANPRM on the feasibility of a two-tier reporting system in which virtually all rail equipment
accidents/incidents are reported to FRA, as now, but in which those involving a substantially higher damage threshold
(for example, $50,000 or $100,000), would trigger requirements for quicker or more detailed reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters favored the concept of two-tier reporting for rail equipment accidents and incidents and recommended
that the minimum reportable threshold be raised to $10,000 or $20,000 to eliminate less serious accidents from reporting
requirements. A few railroads recommended that the second tier begin at $50,000 and that the lower threshold be raised
in increments of $1,000 on a yearly basis. One railroad recommended that a third tier be established for reporting
in greater detail those accidents that result in $100,000 or more in damage. A few commenters did not recommend adoption
of the two-tier reporting system because they believed that such a system would require more details on those accidents
that fell within the second tier and thus would create a more burdensome reporting system.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After examining and assessing the feasibility of all comments received in response to the ANPRM, FRA has concluded
that a two-tier reporting system is not warranted at this time. Adjustment of the reporting threshold, as described
below, would provide FRA with the data it needs to effectively evaluate the true status of railroad safety.

Threshold Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposes to obtain in October of 1994 the latest Producer Price Index (``PPI'') and National Employment Hours
and Earnings figures from the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (``BLS''). At that time, the latest
final figures, as opposed to preliminary figures, would be available to cover the period through June 1994. In October
of each subsequent year, FRA would obtain the latest 12 months of final BLS figures and calculate the threshold for
the upcoming year, publishing the new figure in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 prior to its implementation. FRA hopes to issue a final rulemaking on the new threshold effective as early as January
1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Equation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned previously, FRA proposes to use data from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS),
LABSTAT Series Reports for calculating the threshold. The equation used to adjust the reporting threshold would
be based on the average hourly earnings reported for Class 1 railroads and an overall railroad equipment cost index
determined by the BLS. The two factors would be weighted equally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the wage component, FRA would use LABSTAT Series Report, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 4011
for Class 1 Railroad Average Hourly Earnings. For the equipment component, FRA would use LABSTAT Series Report, Producer
Price Index (PPI) Series 144 for Railroad Equipment. In the month of October of each year, FRA would obtain from the
BLS, finalized cost data covering the twelve-month period ending with the month of June. The monthly figures would
then be totaled and divided by twelve to produce annual averages. The wage data would be reported in terms of dollars
earned per hour, while the equipment cost data would be indexed to a base year of 1982. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedure for adjusting the reporting threshold is shown in the formula below. The wage component appears as a
fractional change relative to the prior year, while the equipment component is a difference of two percentages which
must be divided by 100 to present it in a consistent fractional form. After performing the calculation, the result
would be rounded to the nearest $100.

the proposed formula. The current weightings represent the general assumption that damage repair costs, at levels
at or near the threshold, are split approximately evenly between labor and materials.

G. Miscellaneous Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the proposed changes in the rule text are self-explanatory or have been elucidated in the previous portion
of the preamble. This segment of the NPRM outlines a number of proposed amendments to various sections of the rule text.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicability (&sect;225.3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 225.3 defines the applicability of the accident reporting regulations. FRA's delegated regulatory authority
under 49 U.S.C. 20101 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(formerly contained in the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (the ``Act'') (45 U.S.C. 431 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) permits FRA to amend the current applicability sections of its various regulations so as to contract the populations
of railroads covered by a particular set of regulations or to expand them to the full extent of that authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA, as the Secretary's delegate, has had jurisdiction over all ``railroads'' since the Act was enacted. There is
a very wide range of operations that could be considered tourist railroads under the broadest reading of the term ``railroad.''
Tourist railroads have written several letters to members of Congress questioning the basis for FRA's assertion
of jurisdiction. Additionally, in 1992, FRA received a petition from a scenic railway requesting the need for legislative
and regulatory action for new regulations tailored specifically to the tourist rail industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to clarify the proper extent of the exercise of FRA's jurisdiction, FRA settled on several principles
that will be used as current guidelines. FRA will exercise jurisdiction over all tourist operations, whether or not
they operate over the general railroad system, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
except 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
those that are (1) less than 24 inches in gage and/or (2) insular. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine insularity, FRA looks at various criteria that measure the likelihood that a railroad's operations
might affect a member of the public. FRA has concluded that a tourist operation is insular if its operations are limited
to a separate enclave in such a way that there is no reasonable expectation that the safety of any member of the public
(except a business guest, a licensee of the tourist operation or an affiliated entity, or a trespasser) would be affected
by the operation. An operation is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
considered insular if one or more of the following exists on its line: (a) a public highway-rail crossing that is in
use; (b) an at-grade rail crossing that is in use; (c) a bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial navigation;
or (d) a common corridor with a railroad, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its operations are within 30 feet of those of any railroad. Thus, the mere fact that a tourist operation is not connected
to the general system does not make it insular under these criteria. While these criteria tend to sort out the insular
theme parks and museums, a need to do case-by-case analysis in certain close situations still exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FRA has concluded that part 225 will apply to non-general system, non-insular tourist operations confined
to an installation that is not part of the general system (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it is a stand-alone with no freight traffic but has one or more features that preclude its being considered insular).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Definitions (&sect;225.5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 225.5 lists definitions applicable to part 225. Section 225.5 would be reorganized so that definitions would
appear in alphabetical order and without paragraph designations. The definitions of ``accident/incident,'' ``employee
human factor,'' ``medical treatment,'' ``occupational illness,'' and ``railroad'' would be revised, and the definitions
of ``day away from work,'' ``day of restricted work activity,'' ``establishment,'' ``first aid treatment,'' ``FRA
representative,'' ``non-train incident,'' ``person,'' ``qualified health care professional,'' ``volunteer,''
``work environment,'' ``worker on duty,'' and ``work related'' would be added. The definitions of ``lost workdays''
and ``restriction of work or motion'' would be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Revised definitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Accident/Incident'' as currently defined, is the term used to describe the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
entire
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 list of reportable events including fatalities, injuries and illnesses, collisions, derailments, and similar
accidents involving the operation of on-track equipment causing reportable damage above an established threshold
as well as impacts between railroad on-track equipment and highway users at grade crossings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``train accident'' is reported 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
when reportable damages exceed the reporting threshold. In contrast, an ``incident'' is an event that results in
a reportable casualty, but does not cause reportable damage above the threshold established for train accidents.
In order to minimize any confusion concerning the ``accident/incident'' distinction and to bring about consistency
between the FRA Guide and other rail safety regulations, FRA proposes to define ``train accident,'' ``train incident,''
and ``non-train incident'' separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, a ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
train accident
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined to include any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other event involving operation
of railroad on-track equipment (standing or moving) that results in reportable damages greater than the current
reporting threshold to railroad on-track equipment, signals, track, track structures, and roadbed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
train incident
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined as an event involving the movement of on-track equipment that results in a reportable casualty
but does not cause reportable damage above the threshold established for train accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the definition of ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
employee human factor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' the reference to ``cause code 506'' would be removed as obsolete and replaced by the term ``train accident cause
codes pertaining to non-railroad workers.'' Additionally, the term ``employee human factor'' would be changed
to ``worker human factor.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
medical treatment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be revised to include any medical care or treatment beyond ``first aid'' regardless of who provided such treatment.
Medical treatment does not include diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays or drawing blood samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the definition of ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
occupational illness
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' the reference to ``his or her railroad employment'' would be replaced with the phrase ``worker's railroad employment.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Railroad
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined as it is in 49 U.S.C. 20102 (formerly contained in the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C.
431(e)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed new definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A ``day away from work'' would be defined as any day subsequent to the day of the injury or diagnosis of occupational
illness that a railroad worker does not report to work for reasons associated with his or her condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
day of restricted work activity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined as any day that a worker is restricted (as defined below) in his or her job following the day of the
injury or diagnosis of occupational illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
establishment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined as a physical location where business is conducted or where services or operations are performed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First aid treatment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined as being limited to simple procedures used to treat minor conditions, such as abrasions, cuts,
bruises, or splinters. First aid treatment is typically confined to a single treatment and does not require special
skills or procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FRA representative
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined to include the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA; the Associate Administrator's delegate
(including a qualified State inspector acting under part 212 of this chapter); the Chief Counsel, FRA; or the Chief
Counsel's delegate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
non-train incident
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined as an event that results in a reportable casualty, but does not involve the movement of on-track
equipment nor cause reportable damage above the threshold established for train accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the definition of ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
person
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' independent contractors and their employees and workers, as well as volunteers would be added to the current list
of entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``qualified health care professional'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
would be defined to include a professional operating within the scope of his or her license, registration, or certification.
For example, an otolaryngologist is qualified to diagnose a case of noise-induced hearing loss and identify potential
causal factors, but may not be qualified to diagnose a case of silicosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``volunteer'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
would be defined to include individuals who willingly perform a service for the reporting railroad, who do not receive
direct monetary compensation from that railroad and who are not involved in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment
or (ii) any other safety-sensitive function for the reporting railroad as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;209.303. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Work environment'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
would be defined as the physical location, equipment, materials processed or used, and activities of a worker associated
with his or her work, whether on or off the railroad's property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Work related'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
would be defined to include any incident, activity, exposure, etc. occurring within the work environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A ``worker on duty''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be defined as an individual who receives direct monetary compensation from the railroad and who is engaged in
either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) with any other safety-sensitive function as described in &sect;209.303.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Public Examination and Use of Reports (&sect;225.7) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;225.7(a), reference to ``Executive Director'' would be removed as obsolete, and would be replaced with
``Office of Safety.'' Thus, written requests for a copy of any report would be addressed to the Office of Safety at FRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;225.7(b), ``Accident Reports Act'' would replace the erroneous reference to ``Accidents Reports Act.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Reporting of Accidents/Incidents (&sect;225.11) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 225.11 would be revised to reflect that reports identified in &sect;225.19 submitted via magnetic media
would be due within 30 days after the end of the month in which the accident/incident occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Primary Groups of Accidents/Incidents (&sect;225.19) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed revisions to &sect;225.19(a) and (b) would remove reference to the current threshold of ``$6,300'' and
would replace it with the phrase ``current reporting threshold of (insert current reporting threshold).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;225.19(d), which identifies the third group of accidents (``death, injury or occupational illness'')
that are to be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a, would be simplified to read as follows: ``Each event arising from the
operation of a railroad, must be reported on Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.55a, if it results in (1) death; (2) injury to any person that requires medical treatment; (3) injury to a railroad
worker that results in (i) a day away from work; (ii) restricted work activity or job transfer; or (iii) loss of consciousness;
or (4) occupational illness of a railroad worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Forms (&sect;225.21) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the revisions to the titles of the Forms listed in &sect;225.21, reference to ``Class I and II line-haul
and terminal and switching railroads'' in &sect;225.21(b), would be removed as obsolete, and replaced with ``All
railroads subject to this part.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because FRA is proposing deletion of the annual summary report (as discussed previously in this NPRM), reference
to Form FRA F 6180.45 (entitled ``Annual Summary Report of Railroad Injury and Illness'') in &sect;225.25(f) would
be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed logs/forms discussed in new &sect;&sect;225.25(a) and (b) would be added to the list of forms as &sect;225.21(h),
(Form FRA F 6180.XX_Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log), and as &sect;225.21(i), (Form FRA F 6180.XX(a)_Rail
Equipment Accident/Incident Log). Additionally, the ``Property Damage Estimate Worksheet and Record'' (Form
FRA F 6180.xx(b)) would be added to the list of forms as &sect;225.21(j).

7. Penalties (&sect;225.29) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 225.29 identifies the penalties FRA may impose upon any person that violates any requirement of this part.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who violates any requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such requirement of this part will
be subject to a civil penalty of at least $500 and not more than $10,000 per violation. Civil penalties may be assessed
against individuals only for willful violations, and where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated
violations creates an imminent hazard of death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $20,000 per violation may be assessed.
In addition, each day a violation continues will constitute a separate offense. Finally, a person may be subject to
criminal penalties for knowingly and willfully falsifying reports required by these regulations. Appendix A provides
the revisions to the schedule of penalties under part 225. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Access to Records (Proposed &sect;225.41) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA inspectors frequently encounter reluctance from the railroads when examining and photocopying claims department
records, particularly railroad worker medical records. New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;225.41 would provide FRA representatives, or any representative of a State participating in investigative
and surveillance activities under the Federal railroad safety laws and regulations, access to all records, logs,
and supplementary records related to (a) rail-equipments accidents/incidents, including collisions and derailments;
(b) highway-rail grade crossing accidents/incidents; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) death, injuries, and illnesses, including claims and medical records, for examination and photocopying (at
no expense to the representative) in a reasonable manner during normal business hours. Further, a penalty has been
proposed for each instance the railroad denies a representative access to any record, log, and supplementary record
identified above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Schedule of Penalties (Proposed Revision to &sect;225.33) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix B would be redesignated as Appendix A and would be revised to add penalties for proposed &sect;225.33, ``Failure
to adhere to Internal Control Plan,'' proposed &sect;225.39, ``Failure to Inform Employer of Injury and/or Illness''
and ``Failure to Provide Worker with a Copy of Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.XX(a),'' and proposed &sect;225.41, ``Access to Records.'' Additionally, the dual entries under each of
paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of &sect;225.12 would be coded ``(1)'' and ``(2),'' respectively, to allow the proper
entry of data into FRA's enforcement database. Further, the penalties for violations of &sect;225.12(a) code (2)
would be increased, in light of the 1992 amendments to the Federal Railroad Safety Act which increased the minimum
penalty and settlement to $500.

10. Revision of Title 49, United States Code 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 5, 1994, all Federal railroad safety laws were simultaneously repealed, reenacted without substantive change,
and recodified as positive law in Title 49 of the U.S. Code by Public Law 103&hyph;272. Due to this change, part 225 would
be amended throughout to reference the newly codified provisions.

Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rulemaking has been evaluated in accordance with existing regulatory policies and procedures and
is considered to be a nonsignificant regulatory action under DOT policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,
1979). This NPRM also had been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and is considered ``nonsignificant'' under that
Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the rulemaking is ``nonsignificant,'' FRA nonetheless has prepared a regulatory evaluation addressing
the economic impact of the proposed rule. The regulatory evaluation estimates the economic costs and consequences
of this proposed rule as well as its anticipated benefits and impacts. This regulatory evaluation has been placed
in the docket and is available for public inspection and copying during normal business hours in Room 8201, Office
of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Copies may also be obtained by submitting a written
request to the FRA Docket Clerk at the above address.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) requires a review of proposed rules to assess their impact on small entities, unless the Secretary certifies that
the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. There is no direct or
indirect economic impact on small units of government, businesses, or other organizations. Therefore, it is certified
that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under
the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule contains proposed information collection requirements. FRA will submit these information collection
requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA has endeavored to keep the burden associated with this proposal as simple and minimal as possible. The sections
that contain the new and/or revised information collection requirements and the estimated time to fulfill each requirement
are set forth in the table below. Note that for easy reference, when an information collection requirement has been
revised, the old burden estimate appears in parentheses beside the new burden.

FRA has evaluated these proposed regulations in accordance with its procedures for ensuring full consideration
of the environmental impact of FRA actions, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321

Federalism Implications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This proposed rule should not have a substantial effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government
and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Thus,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparation of a Federalism Assessment is not warranted.

1A penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a willful violation. The Administrator reserves the right
to assess a penalty of up to $20,000 for any violation where circumstances warrant. See 49 CFR part 209, appendix A.
A failure to comply with &sect;225.23 constitutes a violation of &sect;225.11. For purposes of &sect;&sect;225.25
and 225.27 of this part, each of the following constitutes a single act of noncompliance: (1) A missing or incomplete
log entry for a particular worker's injury or illness; or (2) a missing or incomplete log record for a particular rail
equipment accident or incident. Each day a violation continues is a separate offense.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The information collection requirement described below has been submitted to OMB for expedited clearance under
5 CFR 1320.18. The Agency solicits comments on subject submission. This action is necessary in order for the Agency
to amend its Farmer Programs servicing regulations to add the Disaster Set-aside (DSA) Program. This program will
be made available to Farmer Program borrowers who operated a farm or ranch in a county where a disaster occurred in 1993
and was declared/designated a disaster area in accordance with FmHA regulations. Under this program, distressed
borrowers will have the opportunity to move their next scheduled FmHA annual installment to the end of the loan term.
The intended effect is to service disaster victims in an efficient and timely manner while keeping them in business.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Explanation of the circumstances that make the collection of information necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) is requesting expedited clearance of the paperwork burden for this regulation.
Approval is requested in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act and 5 CFR 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighty percent of the 3,151 counties serviced by FmHA were declared disaster areas in 1993. Due to heavy flooding in
the midwest and extreme droughts in the South, considerably more borrowers were affected by disasters in 1993 than
in any of the previous five years. Although this program was initially begun for the borrowers who were affected by
the 1993 disasters, it will also help those who are affected by the 1994 flood disaster in the South if they were also
affected by the previous disasters in 1993. It will also be possible to consider extension of this program to assist
borrowers affected only by the 1994 disaster. This consideration will be given prior to issuance of the final rule.
In order to prevent massive delinquencies and farm failures, it is imperative that borrowers in a crisis situation
receive immediate financial assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is for this purpose and by the authority granted the Secretary under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development
Act (CONACT), Section 331A (7 U.S.C. 1981a), FmHA has made available the Disaster Set-aside Program. As provided
in Section 331A, the Secretary has the authority to defer principal and interest at the request of the borrower on any
outstanding loan made, insured, or held by the Secretary under the CONACT, subject to the borrower showing that due
to circumstances beyond his/her control, he/she is temporarily unable to continue making payments when due without
unduly impairing his/her standard of living. The set-aside program is designed to assist borrowers in financial
distress who operated a farm or ranch in a county where a disaster occurred in 1993 and was declared/designated a disaster
area as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this program, farmer programs borrowers can receive immediate financial relief from their FmHA payment obligations.
FmHA projects that approximately 60,000 borrowers affected by 1993 disasters will request assistance under the
set-aside program. Of these borrowers, approximately 20,000 have installments that came due January 1, 1994. If
these installments are not paid by January 1, 1995, or otherwise set-aside, the borrower will be two installments
behind and will no longer be eligible to receive disaster set-aside assistance. Borrowers more than one payment behind
will be able to receive more assistance and offered more options through FmHA's loan servicing program under 7 CFR
1951&hyph;S. However, borrowers who cannot obtain servicing through 7 CFR 1951&hyph;S may be able to cure their delinquency
with set-aside assistance. The set-aside program will be better for some borrowers than the servicing program provided
through 7 CFR 1951&hyph;S since the set-aside will be a faster process, eligibility requirements are easier to meet,
paperwork is less, and some borrowers will be able to be back on track after one payment is set-aside. The Agency realizes
that although this may not be a solution to finding the borrower a feasible plan, it may provide temporary assistance
to borrowers needing that type of relief. It will allow some borrowers to use sources other than FmHA to maintain their
farm operation and allow them to work out their financial difficulty over the next year or so. Borrowers can cure their
FmHA delinquency while at the same time continue farming and find the means to recover from the affects of the disaster.
Other borrowers may prefer to use the year to voluntarily liquidate. This regulation will therefore provide options
to prevent the foreclosure of borrowers in both of these instances. It is because of these reasons that implementation
of this regulation as an interim rule is crucial to providing assistance to borrowers with the most urgent need while
keeping them in business or allowing them crucial time to make optional choices. Borrowers who are not eligible for
the DSA program, or who need more extensive servicing, will still have the opportunity to be considered for FmHA's
primary loan servicing program as set forth in 7 CFR 1951&hyph;S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The set-aside program allows eligible borrowers to move one FmHA annual installment for each loan to the end of the
loan term, thereby quickly eliminating the immediate financial stress. The installment set-aside may be the one
due immediately after the disaster or, if that installment is paid to the neglect of other creditors or family living
and operating expenses, then the next scheduled installment may be set-aside. Borrowers who received primary loan
servicing after the disaster will not be eligible for the disaster set-aside, as restructuring of the account resolved
the financial distress for the current and next production/marketing period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reporting requirements imposed on the public by the regulations set out in 7 CFR 1951&hyph;T are necessary to administer
this program. Borrowers must request DSA in writing and be able to show from their actual production income and expense
records that because of the disaster, their projected income was reduced to an amount that would prevent payment of
all family living and operating expenses, and paying amounts due FmHA and/or other creditors. The addendum is needed
in order to amend the promissory note/assumption agreement to reflect the amount set-aside and provide for collection
on or before the final due date of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Indicate how, by whom, and for what purpose the information is to be used and the consequence to Federal program or
policy activities if the collection of information was not conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information required of FmHA farm borrowers is collected by FmHA loan servicing officials to facilitate an effective
decision-making process when considering set-aside requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effectiveness of this regulation is dependent upon collection of information from the borrower and the ability
to execute an agreement for future repayment of the set-aside installment. Without this information, the Agency
cannot provide disaster victims with the servicing they most desperately need in an expedient manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the burden imposed by this regulation is described as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Written Request for DSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The letter of notification about the DSA program requires borrowers to respond in writing if they wish to be considered
for set-aside. Written response can be limited to one sentence with signatures of all persons liable for the FmHA debt.
The burden is limited to the time it takes the borrower to read the notification letter and prepare a signed written
request. The average response time is estimated to be 15 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Production, Income and Expenses Records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The letter of notification about the DSA program also requires the borrower to provide actual production, income
and expense figures for the production/marketing period in which the 1993 disaster occurred, unless this information
has already been provided to FmHA. The majority of the borrowers who request DSA will have already provided these records
because of other FmHA regulations that require annual year-end analysis of the farming operation. The average response
time is estimated to be 5 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Addendum to the Promissory Note/Assumption Agreement for the Disaster Set-Aside Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order for eligible borrowers to participate in the DSA program, an addendum must be signed for each loan installment
set-aside and attached to the promissory note/assumption agreement. This addendum must be signed within 30 days
from the date the borrower is notified of eligibility. The addendum provides an agreement from the borrower that the
installment being set-aside, plus accrued interest on any principal set-aside, will be paid on or before the final
due date of the loan. The addendum is completed by FmHA personnel. The burden imposed on the borrower is limited to the
time required to read and sign the addendum. The average burden time is estimated to be 5 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Describe any consideration of the use of improved information technology to reduce burden and any technical or
legal obstacles to reducing burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collected is of such type and nature that the use of improved information technology, such as data
and word processing, would not significantly reduce the public burden. The Agency has not identified any legal obstacles
to reducing reporting burdens associated with this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Describe efforts to identify duplication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Every effort has been made to avoid unnecessary duplication of information collected. Any information that was previously
collected concerning the debtor that remains relevant is utilized to reduce the public burden.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Show specifically why any similar information already available cannot be used or modified for the purpose(s)
described in 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no similar information available to replace the written request of the borrower or the set-aside addendum.
However, and as previously stated, if the borrowers production and income and expense records for the disaster year
have already been collected, this information does not have to be provided again. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. If the collection of information involves small businesses or other small entities, describe the methods used
to minimize burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information required by this regulation places no burden on small businesses or other small entities beyond that
performed in the course of normal business practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Describe the consequence to Federal program or policy activities if the collection were conducted less frequently.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The borrower can only request disaster set-aside one time. Therefore, the frequency of collection is at the absolute
minimum level necessary to enable FmHA to make responsible decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Explain any special circumstances that require the collection to be conducted in a manner inconsistent with the
guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no information requirements that are inconsistent with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Describe efforts to consult with persons outside the agency to obtain their views on the availability of data, frequency
of collection, the clarity of instructions and recordkeeping, disclosure, or reporting format (if any), and on the
data elements to be recorded, disclosed, or reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following groups were contacted in July 1994 to obtain their views on the paperwork burden: (1) Lane Landenburger
of the North Dakota Department of Agriculture, Telephone number 701&hyph;223&hyph;4423, (2) Lynn Hayes, Farmers
Legal Action Group, Telephone number 612&hyph;223&hyph;5400, (3) Renee Robinson, Illinois Stewardship Alliance,
Telephone number 217&hyph;498&hyph;9707, and (4) Melody G. Julian, National Association of County Supervisors,
316&hyph;227&hyph;3761. The regulation and form letter were reviewed. Their comments were all favorable. In their
opinion, the regulation and instructions to the borrower were easy to understand. Most borrowers should have their
actual records for the 1993 disaster year completed since the 1993 tax year has already passed. In fact, most borrowers
will have already provided these records to FmHA for their year-end analysis and will not have to provide them again.
In these cases, the only item left to submit is the letter of request. They also stated the addendum the borrower signs
is easy to read and understand and there shouldn't be any confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Describe any assurance of confidentiality provided to respondents and the basis for the assurance in statute,
regulation, or agency policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no assurance of confidentiality provided to respondents for the information required by this regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Provide additional justification for any questions of a sensitive nature, such as sexual behavior and attitudes,
religious beliefs, and other matters that are commonly considered private. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information to be collected under this regulation does not involve any questions of a sensitive nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Provide estimates of annualized cost to the Federal Government and to the respondents. Also provide a description
of the method used to estimate cost, which should include quantification of hours, operational expenses, and any
other expense that would not have been incurred without the paperwork burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual cost to the Federal Government to implement and administer this regulation is estimated to be $1,544,400,
which includes salaries, operational expenses and overhead. The national average cost factor is $17.16 per hour.
Federal Government costs for this regulation are based on the number of notifications, responses and persons qualifying
for the program, times the hourly cost factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated annual cost to respondents is $246,092, using a rate of $10.34, derived from the Statistical Abstract
of the United States 1992, the National Data Book, Table 650, page 410. This table was based on information from the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Average Hourly and Weekly Earnings in Current and Constant (1982) Dollars for 1991.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Provide estimates of the burden of the collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attached is a chart indicating the estimates of the public's annual burden. FmHA estimates that approximately 100,000
farmer programs borrowers will be notified of the DSA program. This number includes all FP borrowers who operated
in a disaster area during 1993. FmHA estimates that approximately 60,000 of these borrowers will make a written request
for DSA. The other 40,000 will not apply for various reasons. Approximately 10,000 borrowers have or will be restructured
under subpart S of part 1951 and therefore will not be eligible for this program. Approximately 20,000 will not apply
because they know they cannot meet the eligibilty requirements. The other 10,000 will not apply because even though
they might have operated in a disaster area, they were able to pay all family living and operating expenses, and all
payments to FmHA and other creditors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 60,000 borrowers who request DSA, FmHA estimates that 50,000 will actually receive DSA. The other 10,000 will
either not qualify for the program or will choose 1951&hyph;S servicing instead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Explain reasons for changes in burden, including the need for any increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is a new regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. For collections of information whose results are planned to be published for statistical use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no plans to publish information from these documents for statistical purposes and therefore Section B does
not apply.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This subpart sets forth the policies and procedures for establishing and implementing the Disaster Set-aside Program
(DSA). The DSA program is available to Farmer Programs (FP) borrowers, as defined in subpart S of this part, who suffered
losses as a result of a 1993 disaster. FP loans that may be serviced under this subpart include Farm Ownership (FO),
Operating (OL), Soil and Water (SW), Emergency (EM), Economic Emergency (EE), Special Livestock (SL), Economic
Opportunity (EO), Softwood Timber (ST), Recreation (RL), and Rural Housing loans for farm service buildings (RHF).
Non-program (NP) farm type loans may be serviced under this subpart for borrowers who also have program FP loans. FP
borrowers have until July 1, 1995, to request disaster set-aside and submit a complete application. Requests received
after this date will not be accepted.

General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Disaster set-aside is a program whereby borrowers who are current or not more than 1 installment behind on any and all
FP loans may be permitted to move one Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) scheduled annual installment(s) for each
eligible FP loan to the end of the loan term. Borrowers whose loans are restructured in accordance with subpart S of
this part after the disaster occurred are not eligible for the DSA program. The intent of this program is to relieve
some of the borrower's immediate financial stress caused by the disaster and avoid foreclosure by the Government.

Notification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The County Supervisor will use form letter 1951&hyph;1&hyph;T to notify FP borrowers of the availability of the DSA
program and how to apply. All FP borrowers, as defined in &sect;1951.906 of subpart S of this part, who operated a farm
or ranch in a county during 1993 in which a disaster occurred and was declared/designated as a disaster area, or contiguous
county, as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter will be notified within 10 days of the effective date of
this instruction. Notification of the DSA program will not affect the notification requirements set forth in subpart
S of this part.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Request for DSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All FP borrowers liable for the debt must request disaster set-aside in writing prior to July 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Borrowers must provide the County Supervisor with actual production, income and expense figures for the production/marketing
period in which the 1993 disaster occurred, unless this information is already in the borrower case file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Borrowers may only be considered for DSA one time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Eligibility requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The borrower operated a farm or ranch in a county declared/designated a disaster area as set forth in subpart A of
part 1945 of this chapter, or a contiguous county to such an area based on a 1993 disaster. The borrower must have been
operating the farm or ranch at the time of the disaster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The borrower has acted in good faith as defined in &sect;1951.906 of subpart S of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) All nonmonetary defaults have been resolved. This means that even though the borrower has acted in good faith,
he/she may still be in default for reasons, such as, but not limited to: no longer farming, prior lienholder foreclosure,
bankruptcy, not properly maintaining chattel and real estate security, not properly accounting for the sale of security
as agreed, or not carrying out any other agreements made with FmHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The borrower is current or not more than one installment behind on any and all FP loans at the time the scheduled installment(s)
will be set-aside as reflected on the Finance Office 540 or 582 status reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The borrower's projected income for the disaster year was reduced as a result of the disaster, causing insufficient
income available to pay all family living and operating expenses, pay debts to other creditors and pay FmHA. This determination
will be based on the borrower's actual production and income and expense records for the disaster year. Releases of
normal income security will continue as set forth in subpart A of part 1962 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The term remaining on the loan(s) receiving set-aside equals or exceeds 2 years from the due date of the installment
being set-aside.

(a) Eligibility determination. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon receipt of a DSA request, the County Supervisor will determine whether the borrower meets the eligibility requirements
set forth in &sect;1951.953(c) of this subpart and notify the borrower of the results within 30 days from the date of
the DSA request. The file shall contain documentation to reflect the date of request and the date the borrower was notified
and the addendum signed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The borrower shall be provided up to 30 days to sign Exhibit A, ``Addendum to the Promissory Note/Assumption Agreement
for the Disaster Set-aside Program.'' If the addendum is not signed within 30 days and/or prior to the borrower becoming
more than 1 installment behind, the DSA request will be withdrawn and the borrower notified of their appeal rights
under subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Pending requests for primary loan servicing will continue to be considered as set forth in subpart S of this part.
However, borrowers cannot accept servicing under both programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Borrowers determined eligible for the DSA and 1951&hyph;S servicing will be required to choose between the two
program requests. The choice will be noted in the borrower case file and initialed by the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Borrowers may choose to proceed with the DSA prior to a decision being made for primary loan servicing such as in
cases where a decision will not be available on the primary loan servicing application prior to the borrower becoming
more than 1 installment behind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The application for the program not chosen will automatically be withdrawn at the time the installment(s) are
set-aside or the loan(s) restructured, whichever is applicable. This voluntary withdrawal is not appealable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) By signing Exhibit A of this subpart, the borrower agrees to the withdrawal of any pending request for primary
loan servicing. The borrower may resubmit a request at any time according to subpart S of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Processing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Installments will be set-aside as set forth in this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All borrowers liable for the debt will sign Exhibit A of this subpart for each loan installment set-aside. Exhibit
A may be modified with the assistance of the Office of the General Counsel to comply with individual State laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Only one unpaid installment for each FP loan may be set-aside. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The installment set-aside will be the first scheduled annual installment due immediately after the disaster
occurred, or if that installment is paid current, the next scheduled annual installment. Set-aside will not be granted
on the loan if both of these installments are paid current. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The amount set-aside will not exceed the annual scheduled installment being set-aside minus any portion of that
installment paid prior to Exhibit A being signed by the borrower. This amount will include the unpaid interest and
any principal that would be credited to the account as if the installment were paid on the due date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Recoverable cost items charged to FO, SW, and RHF loans may be set-aside with the annual installment. Cost items
identified with a loan number different from the parent loan cannot be set-aside. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Interest will accrue on any principal amount set-aside at the same rate charged the non-set-aside portion. Interest
will not accrue on the interest portion set-aside. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The amount set-aside, including interest accrual on any principal set-aside, will be due on or before the final
due date of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) There are no security requirements attached to the DSA program. All existing security instruments will remain
in effect.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) Exhibit A will be used as the source document to process the set-aside through ADPS. Until automation capabilities
are implemented, Exhibit A should be placed in a pending file and the borrower's account flagged ``51&hyph;S.'' The
Finance Office borrower account status reports will reflect the amount(s) set-aside for each loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The National Automated Tracking System (AGCREDIT) will be utilized to document the notification and servicing
scheme associated with this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The loan(s) will be considered current after the installment(s) is set-aside and, therefore, debt writedown
or net recovery buyout may not be subsequently approved under subpart S of this part, and loans may not be made under
&sect;1941.14 of subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter, unless the set-aside is reversed as set forth in &sect;1951.958(b)(2)
of this subpart or the borrower becomes delinquent on the non-set-aside portion.

Adverse determination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Borrowers who do not meet the requirements for the DSA program will be notified of their appeal rights in accordance
with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. If the borrower becomes more than 1 installment behind on any FP loan while
processing the DSA request, or while an appeal is being considered, the DSA request will be denied and/or any associated
appeal request withdrawn. Being denied set-aside based on the failure to meet the not-more-than-1-installment-behind
requirement is not an appealable issue, but is reviewable. The letter to the borrower will describe in full detail
all the reasons for the adverse decision. Borrowers denied set-aside will continue to be serviced in accordance with
subpart S of this part.

``Schedule of Remittance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The set-aside will be reversed and the addendum cancelled if, prior to the first scheduled installment due date
after set-aside, the current borrower needs a writedown in order to develop a feasible plan or a net recovery buyout
in accordance with subpart S of this part, or loan assistance set forth in &sect;1941.14 of subpart A of part 1941 of
this chapter. The Finance Office must be notified by memorandum of the set-aside reversal prior to the time assistance
is granted. A copy of the memorandum will be attached to the addendum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In cases not covered by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the set-aside will be considered automatically cancelled
whenever a program loan receives primary loan servicing.

The Administrator may, in individual cases, make an exception to any requirement or provision of this subpart or address
any omission of this subpart which is not inconsistent with the authorizing statute or other applicable law if it is
determined that application of the requirement or provision or failure to take action in the case of an omission would
adversely affect the Government's interest. The Administrator will exercise this authority upon the request of
the State Director, with the recommendation of the Assistant Administrator for Farmer Programs; or upon request
initiated by the Assistant Administrator for Farmer Programs. Requests for exception must be made in writing and
supported with documentation to explain the adverse effect and proposed alternative courses of action, and to show
how the adverse effect will be eliminated or minimized if the exception is granted.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service will issue a supplemental Draft EIS for the Shamrock Timber Sale(s). The supplement will include
an additional road and unit, minor road changes, designation of retention areas, a new Forest Service list of sensitive
species, a change in subsistence findings, and a change in the range of timber volume in the Proposed Action and Purpose
and Need. This revised Notice of Intent (NOI) updates and replaces the December 1991 Notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action changes from 10&hyph;40 to 10&hyph;52 million board feet of commercial timber within the Shamrock
area, and as before, to construct the associated road system. The timber would be sold in one or more timber sales beginning
in September 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study area includes Value Comparison Units 436, 438, and 429 on Kupreanof Island in southeast Alaska. This area,
encompassing approximately 108,000 acres, has been allocated by the Tongass Land Management Plan to Land Use Designation
IV, in which management emphasis is primarily on commodity or market resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice of the draft EIS was published on page 45338 of the 10/27/93 issue, and the comment period of the Draft EIS was
extended on page 59033 of the 11/5/93 issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this project is to provide 10&hyph;52 million board feet of timber for harvest according to direction
described in the Tongass Land Management Plan, to meet the Federal obligation to make timber volume available for
harvest by timber operators, and to improve the timber productivity of the project area by harvesting mature stands
of timber and replacing them with faster growing stands of second-growth timber.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to be made is whether to harvest 10&hyph;52 million board feet of timber from the Shamrock Study Area,
and if so, in which locations and under what conditions. This decision will be made by Abigail R. Kimbell, the Stikine
Area Forest Supervisor.

The supplemental Draft EIS is scheduled for publication in December 1994 and the Final EIS in September 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so it is meaningful and
alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

NRDC, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
435 U.S. 519, 533 [1978]). Also, environmental objections that could have been raised at the Draft EIS stage may be
waived if not raised until after the completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts (

Harris, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 [E.D. Wis. 1980]). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is helpful if comments refer to specific
pages or chapters of the draft environmental impact statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft
environmental impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers
may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementing the procedural provisions
of the National Environmental Policy Act in 40 CFR 1503.3 while addressing these points.

In a continuous effort to devise policy and practice aimed at reducing turnover among field representatives (FR)s&hyph;&hyph;our
field interviewing staff&hyph;&hyph;the Census Bureau needs to collect data on the reasons FRs leave the Bureau.
An exit questionnaire will help the Census Bureau in identifying specific reasons for the turnovers. Based on the
survey results, the Census Bureau can develop both general and specific plans to reduce turnover. Approximately
every month, a sample of one&hyph;half of all FRs voluntarily resigning within the period will be contacted by telephone
to complete a questionnaire. Interviewers hired to conduct the census enumeration will not be included in the sample.
Similar data was last gathered in 1992. Since computers have recently become part of the FRs' tools the questionnaire
now incorporates questions how on the use of computers may affect their decisions on continued employment.

The Census Bureau is developing and evaluating a design to continuously measure the long&hyph;form data that has
traditionally been collected once a decade as part of the decennial census. Under the Continuous Measurement System
(CMS) a long&hyph;form questionnaire would be mailed to a sample of different addresses contained in our master address
file (MAF) each month. Continuously collecting the long&hyph;form data will not only provide more timely data, but
will lessen respondent burden in the decennial census. The first phase in this research is to conduct a survey in approximately
2,000 different households each month over a 14 month period. The objectives of this test are to determine the feasibility
and costs of a telephone nonrespondent follow&hyph;up component for the CMS, examine question wording to collect
``rolling'' or accumulated income estimates based on 5 years of data, review possible seasonal effects on income
estimates, prototype the processing system, and research the cost and effectiveness of using cross&hyph;reference
directories to obtain phone numbers. Random Digit Dialing (RDD) will be employed in the test as a means of sampling
and for obtaining telephone numbers of households.

For the 2000 decennial census, as well as other census programs, the Census Bureau is building on its 1990 census address
list to create a permanent and continuously maintained Master Address File (MAF). We will link this national inventory
of living quarters to the Census Bureau's Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER)
data base. The existence of such a linked address/geographic file for the nation will provide important opportunities
for the Census Bureau's research and demographic programs. The Census Bureau currently solicits the participation
of local governments and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in a cooperative arrangement to determine
the locations of missing addresses and streets to assist us in maintaining the TIGER data base. For those not wishing
to participate we will conduct the FARSAS to help us determine both the availability and usefulness of reference materials
we can use to update the TIGER data base for those areas. On the basis of information collected during FARSAS we will
be able to resolve non&hyph;matching cases from the geocoding process.

On March 23, 1992, Mega Computer Corporation (Mega Computer) was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of California of violating the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C.A. app. 2401&hyph;2420
(1991, Supp. 1993, and Public Law 103&hyph;277, July 5, 1994)) (the Act). The conviction followed a plea of guilty
to one count of a multiple-count criminal indictment. Mega Computer was convicted of knowingly violating the Act
by exporting from the United States to Singapore United States-origin computer equipment without the validated
export license required by the Export Administration Regulations (currently codified at 15 CFR Parts 768&hyph;799
(1994)) (the Regulations).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 11(h) of the Act provides that, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 no person convicted of violating the Act, or certain other provisions of the United States Code, shall be eligible
to apply for or use any export license issued pursuant to, or provided by, the Act or the Regulations for a period of up
to 10 years from the date of the conviction. In addition, any export license issued pursuant to the Act in which such
a person had any interest at the time of its conviction may be revoked.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 29, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative
reviews of the antidumping duty order on color television receivers (CTVs) from the Republic of Korea covering exports
of this merchandise to the United States by the manufacturer Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. (Daewoo). Based on our review
of these exports during the period April 1, 1988 through March 31, 1989, we found a margin of 4.00 percent. Daewoo had
no shipments during the April 1, 1989 through March 31, 1990, administrative review period. We invited interested
parties to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from the Independent Radionic Workers of America,
International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Technical, Salaried, and Machine Workers, AFL-CIO, the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers of America, and the Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO (collectively the petitioners)
and Daewoo stating that they have no objection to our preliminary results. Therefore, our final results of review
remain unchanged from those presented in our preliminary results.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the preliminary results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order on CTVs from the Republic of Korea
(49 FR 18336; April 1984) covering exports of this merchandise to the United States by the manufacturer, Daewoo. For
administrative convenience, we have combined the results of two reviews covering the periods April 1, 1988 through
March 31, 1989, and April 1, 1989 through March 31, 1990, for this manufacturer. We have now completed these administrative
reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by these reviews include CTVs, complete and incomplete, from the Republic of Korea. The order covers
all CTVs regardless of tariff classification. During the period of review, the subject merchandise was classified
under item numbers 684.9246, 684.9248, 684.9250, 684.9252, 684.9253, 684.9255, 684.9256, 684. 9258, 684.9262,

Analysis of Comments Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We invited interested parties to comment on our preliminary results of the reviews. We received comments from petitioners
and Daewoo stating that they have no objection to our preliminary results. Therefore, our final results of review
remain the same as those presented in our preliminary results.

Final Results of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on our review of these exports during the period April 1, 1988 through March 31, 1989, we determine Daewoo's dumping
margin to be 4.00 percent. Daewoo had no shipments during the April 1, 1989 through March 31, 1990, administrative
review period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department shall instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, since Daewoo has been reviewed in a period subsequent to this period, the cash deposit rate for Daewoo
will remain at 0.90 percent, the company's rate from the most recently reviewed period. See,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 21958; April 28, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their
responsibilities concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These administrative reviews and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, as amended (19

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 5, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 41721) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on silicon metal
from Brazil (July 12, 1991, 56 FR 36135). The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance
with Section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).

Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise covered by this review is silicon metal containing at least 96.00 but less than 99.99 percent of silicon
metal from Brazil. Silicon metal is currently provided for under subheadings 2804.69.10 and 2804.69.50 of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harmonized Tariff Schedule 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(HTS) as a chemical product, but is commonly referred to as a metal. Semiconductor grade silicon metal (silicon metal
containing by weight not less than 99.99 percent of silicon and provided for in subheading 2804.61.00 of the HTS) is
not subject to the order. HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description
remains dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 3, 1993 the Department determined, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.29 (1993), that silicon metal with a higher aluminum
content containing between 89 and 96 percent of silicon metal is of the same class or kind of merchandise as silicon
metal subject to the antidumping duty order. While this scope determination was undertaken in the context of the antidumping
duty order governing silicon metal from the People's Republic of China, the silicon metal subject to that order is
the same as the silicon metal covered by this order. Therefore, the Department will include such merchandise in future
reviews of this order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This review covers four manufacturers/exporters of Brazilian silicon metal. The period covered by this review is
March 29, 1991 through June 30, 1992.

Analysis of Comments Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results as provided by section 353.22(c)
of the Department's regulations. We received comments from the petitioners (American Alloys, Inc., Elkham Metals
Company, Globe Metallurgical Inc., SKW Metals &amp; Alloys, Inc. and SMI Group, Inc., Rock Island Silicon Division)
and from four respondents (Companhia Brasileira Carbureto de Calcio (CBCC), Companhia Ferroligas Minas Gerais-Minasligas
(Minasligas), Eletrosilex Belo Horizonte (Eletrosilex), and Rima Eletrometalurgia S.A. (Rima)). On January 14,
1994, we held a public hearing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners contend that CBCC refused to provide cost information necessary for the calculation of cost of production
(COP) and constructed value (CV). Specifically, petitioners argue that CBCC did not properly report its interest
expenses and charcoal replacement costs. Petitioners also contend that CBCC understated its electricity and quartz
replacement costs. Petitioners conclude that the Department should utilize the highest, most adverse margin as
best information available (BIA) since the deficiencies in CBCC's COP/CV response are so pervasive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree with petitioners. While during verification we did find areas where the costs were not appropriately
quantified, we have not found these deficiencies to be so significant or pervasive as to call into question the accuracy
of the entire response. It should be noted that some of the issues, as discussed in comments 2, 4, 6, and 11, are related
to methodological questions, rather than areas of incorrect reporting of costs. In the instances where we found insufficient
verification support (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
December 20, 1993 ``CBCC Cost Verification Report''), we relied on partial BIA. For the methodological issues, we
recalculated the costs to correct a particular cost element. Although we have made certain adjustments to the information
submitted by CBCC (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 our responses to comments 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9), we generally have used CBCC's data in reaching these final results of
administrative review.

Comment 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners note that Solvay do Brasil owns 99.8 percent of CBCC. Petitioners contend that if the Department uses
the COP/CV information submitted by CBCC, it should base its calculation of interest expense upon the borrowing experience
associated with the consolidated group of companies. Petitioners contend that the Department should use the financial
expenses reported on Solvay do Brasil's financial statements to perform this calculation. Finally, petitioners
assert that the Department should apply this allocation to the replacement cost of manufacture (COM) to properly
account for Brazilian hyperinflation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CBCC argues that calculation of interest expense on a consolidated basis would be improper. CBCC contends that the
December 20, 1993, verification report concludes that CBCC made interest-free loans to Solvay do Brasil. CBCC contends
that it charged Solvay do Brasil the minimum Brazilian statutory requirement for the monetary correction. CBCC also
argues that the Department found no evidence of loans from Solvay do Brasil to CBCC at verification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with petitioners that CBCC's interest expense should be calculated on a consolidated basis. Since the cost
of capital is fungible, we believe that calculating interest expense based on consolidated statements is the most
appropriate methodology (see,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to extinguish its outstanding debt, CBCC issued new shares of capital stock to its parent company. Also, we
established at verification that Solvay do Brasil owns 99.8 percent of CBCC. Based on these facts, it is evident that
the shift in debt is due to the parent company's control over the subsidiary. Accordingly, the degree of relationship
influenced the structure of debt for the entire company. Therefore, consistent with our normal practice, we revised
CBCC's submitted interest expenses based on the consolidated financial statements of Solvay do Brasil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During verification, CBCC company officials did not provide the source documents for Solvay's financial income
and expenses. Therefore, we have used BIA to determine CBCC's financial expenses. As BIA, we used information from
Solvay do Brasil's financial statements. This percentage was then applied to each month's COM to ensure that CBCC's
COP data fully reflected interest expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 3:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners contend that the Department's December 20, 1993, COP verification report suggested allocating interest
expenses to CBCC's COP based on the sum of the financial expenses reflected in CBCC's and Solvay do Brasil's 1991 and
1992 financial statements. Petitioners note that if the Department took that approach, it would determine interest
expenses as a percentage of the sum of both companies' cost of goods sold (COGS), adjusted for intercompany interest
transactions. Petitioners further contend that CBCC's financial statements reflect only net interest expenses,
and that use of the allocation that the Department proposed in its December 20, 1993, verification report would give
CBCC credit for all of its interest income, whether short-term or not. Petitioners argue that CBCC submitted no information
regarding short-term interest income, making it impossible for the Department to make any adjustment for intercompany
interest transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with petitioners that CBCC did not provide information documenting the company's short-term interest income.
As previously discussed in our response to Comment 2, we have relied upon BIA in our calculation of CBCC's interest
expense. As BIA, we used the financial expense information from Solvay do Brasil's financial statements. We then
applied this percentage to each month's COM for purposes of our COP/CV calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 4:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners assert that CBCC purchased electricity at a discount when the electricity is used to restart idled machinery.
Petitioners note that, prior to March 1992, CBCC averaged the cost of electricity obtained from its own production
and from three separate pricing plans. Petitioners note that, after March 1992, CBCC stopped averaging electricity
costs, and used the discounted electricity associated with the running of idled machines. Petitioners contend that
the Department should use CBCC's average electricity costs in the COP/CV calculations rather than the discounted
electricity costs associated with the restarting of idled machinery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CBCC contends that the antidumping law contemplates that producers will base pricing decisions on currently available
COP information. CBCC contends that the Department verified that the furnace was idle prior to the acquisition of
the discounted energy, and that the discounted energy was only used on the restarted furnace. CBCC argues that it applied
the discounted energy to silicon metal so as to minimize the COP of silicon metal consistent with the Department's
COP methodology. CBCC suggests that averaging its electricity costs would result in rejection of its cost data simply
because the cost is not high enough.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In reaching these final results we have relied upon our general practice in a hyperinflationary economy which is to
calculate a monthly average cost for each input. The Department believes that it is inappropriate to specifically
identify inputs obtained at a lower cost to a particular product or production run. The furnaces used to produce silicon
metal can produce other products that are not subject to review. Likewise, other furnaces used to produce non-subject
merchandise can be used to produce silicon metal. Accordingly, any benefits derived from the use of a particular furnace
relate to all products produced during the period of review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note that in this case it is strictly a management decision as to which product will be made in the furnace which is
receiving the less expensive input. As such, in months in which there were U.S. shipments of silicon metal, the furnace
which utilizes less expensive electricity can be assigned to produce silicon metal. That same furnace could be assigned
to produce ferrosilicon in months in which CBCC had U.S. sales of ferrosilicon, a product which is also subject to an
antidumping duty order. In fact, during the period covered by this review, the furnace in question did produce both
silicon metal and ferrosilicon. (Both silicon metal and ferrosilicon were also produced in other furnaces.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facts of the instant case are consistent with the Department's position requiring the weight-averaging of the
costs of merchandise produced in more than one facility. The Department has consistently held that it is inappropriate
to make adjustments for cost differences between facilities when the merchandise produced in each is identical (see

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 5:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners contend that the Department verified that on several occasions CBCC paid an advance deposit on its electricity
bill. Petitioners further contend that the Department should make an upward adjustment to CBCC's reported electricity
costs to account for the effect of Brazilian inflation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CBCC argues that it received a credit from CEMIG (its energy supplier) for advance payment. CBCC asserts that the Department
should deduct the amount of the credit from the invoiced amount since that represents the real ``cost'' of the item.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In calculating the replacement cost of electricity obtained in each month of the period of review we used the invoiced
price for that month. We did not reduce the invoiced amount for the effect of any ``credits'' CBCC may have obtained.
Such a reduction would not properly reflect the replacement cost of electricity. Although this is a short-term monetary
asset which is not subject to the balance sheet monetary corrections, through agreement, CEMIG credits CBCC for the
value of cruzeiros as of the invoice date. This does not reduce the replacement cost of electricity CBCC obtained but
merely reduces the nominal cruzeiro amount outstanding. Under the Department's replacement cost methodology each
month's cost is measured in the monthly nominal invoiced cruzeiro amounts. Therefore, we have accepted the amounts
billed by CEMIG as each month's replacement cost, without the effect of the ``credit.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 6:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners note that CBCC reported electricity costs exclusive of the ICMS tax in its calculation of third-country
COP. Petitioners contend that these tax payments should have been included in CBCC's calculation of electricity
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with petitioner. When using third-country sales as the basis of FMV, we must determine if the manufacturer
incurred costs which resulted from the payment of taxes on the purchase of inputs. In this review period, CBCC incurred
ICMS tax, a value added tax (``VAT''), in purchasing electricity. CBCC is able to offset some of this tax when it sells
products in the home market because it charges and receives a VAT on its home market sales. In this case, even though
the home market was not viable, CBCC did make some home market sales. However, there were not enough home market sales
for the VAT charged and received on those sales to offset all of the VAT it paid on the electricity purchased to produce
the merchandise sold in the third country. Accordingly, this resulted in a net cost to CBCC for the ICMS taxes paid in
the production of silicon metal sold for export. As such, the Department included the net amount of the ICMS VAT in the
submitted COP and CV amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach differs from that used in the Department's remand determination concerning the underlying investigation.
In that determination, we made an allowance for an offset to the ICMS VAT paid currently for potential VAT to be received
on future home market sales. Under this approach the ICMS was, in effect, excluded from the calculation of constructed
value. We have subsequently reconsidered this methodology and have concluded that allowing such an offset for potential,
future sales results in an adjustment that we now consider to be purely speculative. Accordingly, we will include
in CV ICMS on inputs that are not offset by VAT charged and collected on actual home market sales which occur during the
period of review. We believe our current approach better reflects the economic reality of the costs incurred during
the period of review (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.

Comment 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners contend that CBCC made no provision in its calculation of charcoal costs for the effects of inflation
when CBCC harvested an area. Petitioners note that the Department requested additional documentation from CBCC
at verification regarding CBCC's estimates of charcoal harvest and the other assumptions CBCC built into its calculation
of charcoal cost. Petitioners contend that, because CBCC failed to provide information, the Department should apply
BIA. Petitioners argue that use of BIA is appropriate when a respondent refuses to submit information after being
asked to do so, and where the refusal to provide the requested information impedes the Department's proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners contend that CBCC's failure to provide the appropriate information justifies the use of noncooperative
BIA for CBCC. Finally, if the Department determines not to use noncooperative BIA for CBCC, petitioners suggest that
the Department adjust CBCC's reported cost for company-produced charcoal upward to an amount equal to that charged
to CBCC from unrelated suppliers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with petitioners that we should adjust CBCC's charcoal replacement costs. However, we disagree that CBCC
was noncooperative and should receive a margin based solely upon BIA. We discovered errors made by CBCC when it calculated
its cost of producing charcoal, a primary raw material used in the production of silicon metal. For purposes of calculating
replacement costs, CBCC substantially understated its cost of producing charcoal by inaccurately recording the
costs associated with its forests which provide the raw material needed to produce charcoal. We note, however, that
CBCC reported cost information consistent with that which is maintained in its normal cost accounting system. Therefore,
we have recalculated the cost of CBCC's production of charcoal. We relied upon the actual weighted-average monthly
cost CBCC was charged by unrelated vendors. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 8:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners argue that the Department should revise CBCC's reported 1992 quartz replacement costs upward to account
for the more costly delivery charges the Department discovered at verification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At verification we noted that CBCC changed procedures for quartz purchasing in 1992. Because we found that CBCC's
reported quartz replacement costs for 1992 did not reflect the entire cost of the material, we randomly chose May 1992
as a sample to determine the amount of the discrepancy. In establishing the amount of the discrepancy, we valued all
quartz purchases received in May at the delivered price in effect for the region of origin. This reconciliation indicated
that CBCC's estimate of delivery charges for this month understated the per ton cost for quartz by approximately four
percent. Because CBCC did not fully report its quartz replacement costs, we have applied partial BIA for this material.
As BIA, we have adjusted upward the reported quartz prices reported for January through May 1992 by four percent.

Comment 9:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners contend that CBCC's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses is flawed. Petitioners note that
there is a large difference between the amount of silicon metal produced by CBCC and the amount of silicon metal sold
by CBCC. Petitioners also object to the limited data provided by CBCC for electrode paste and charcoal and argue that
CBCC's inclusion of a large year-end depreciation charge in December 1991 resulted in significantly understated
COPs for all but one month of the review period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners assert that, by using sales and production data provided by CBCC, petitioners have derived a corrected
inventory holding gain/loss calculation for CBCC. Petitioners contend that the Department should use petitioners'
revised calculation of CBCC's inventory holding gains/losses in the final results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have reviewed CBCC's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses (see CBCC's February 24, 1993 submission
at Exhibit A) and have found certain inconsistencies which render that calculation unacceptable. For certain months
CBCC reported sales and shipments of silicon metal but showed no removal of silicon metal from inventory. In other
months, the tonnage of silicon metal removed from inventory was either much less or much greater than the amount of
merchandise that CBCC reported in its sales listings.

Moreover, we find that petitioners' ``corrected'' calculation of CBCC's inventory gains/losses is also unacceptable
since it fails to account for finished silicon metal consumed in the production of other products. Accordingly, we
have rejected both CBCC's and petitioners' calculation of inventory gains/losses, and have removed this item from
our COP/CV calculations, which has the effect of increasing COP/CV.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners argue that the Department should make an addition to CBCC's COP to account for certain costs (power, secondary
materials and crushing costs) which CBCC omitted from CBCC's revised COP/CV calculation. Petitioners note that
these expenses were included in CBCC's original COP/CV response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CBCC contends that power, secondary materials and crushing costs were included in its revised response under the
variable ``VARCOM.'' CBCC argues that it summarized these three costs in order to comply with the Department's reporting
requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the power, secondary materials and crushing costs were not detailed in CBCC's revised COP/CV calculations,
the total reported costs furnished by CBCC (variables ``TOTCOP'' and ``TOTCV'') did include these expenses. CBCC
did omit these items from the variables representing variable overhead, fixed overhead, and total variable cost
of manufacturing, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 variables ``VARFOH'', ``FIXFOH'', and ``TOTCOM''. However, since CBCC included these expenses in its calculation
of total COM, no adjustment to CBCC's reported COP or CV is required.

Comment 11: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners contend the Department should reject CBCC's allocation of general and administrative (G&amp;A) and
selling expenses. (CBCC allocated these expenses to individual products using the ratio of each product's cost of
goods sold (COGS).) Petitioners contend that the Department should follow its established practice and allocate
these expenses to total COGS, as the Department did in the preliminary results of this review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CBCC suggests that the allocation of G&amp;A and selling expenses used in the Department's preliminary calculations
results in a systematic overstatement of these expenses. CBCC argues that the Department should allocate the ratio
of G&amp;A and selling expenses by the historical ratio of these expenses to historical COM. CBCC notes that the Department
followed this methodology in the redetermination of the original investigation for this proceeding (see

Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 G&amp;A expenses are period expenses which are normally measured over a fiscal year. As such, the Department calculated
G&amp;A on an annual historical basis. In order to avoid overstating G&amp;A expenses and to neutralize hyperinflationary
effects, we applied the G&amp;A ratio (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the ratio of annual G&amp;A expenses to cost of goods sold reflected in the financial statements) to each month's COM
calculated on a historical basis. In addition, CBCC had failed to include Solvay do Brasil's G&amp;A expenses. Therefore,
we applied a portion of Solvay do Brasil's G&amp;A in the final calculation of these costs (see CBCC Calculation Adjustment
Memorandum, February 2, 1994). This is consistent with the method we used to calculate G&amp;A expenses in the remand
determination in the underlying investigation.

Comment 12:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners contend that the Department should include ICMS and IPI taxes in the calculation of CBCC's raw material
costs. Petitioners contend that these taxes are included on home market sales, and must, therefore, be included in
the COP of home market merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners' argument that ICMS and IPI taxes are included on home market sales is not relevant since CBCC's home market
sales were insufficient to form a basis for FMV and, therefore, FMV was based upon third country sales. However, we
agree that, since the ICMS and IPI taxes resulted in a net cost to CBCC, the Department should include this net amount
of ICMS and IPI in the submitted COP and CV amounts. Our reasoning for doing so is discussed further in our response to
comment 6, which involved a similar situation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with petitioners. In these final results we have included CBCC's and Minasligas's imputed credit costs in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners contend that the Department should use the quartz replacement costs reported by Minasligas in its original
COP/CV response rather than the costs reported in Minasligas's revised response of November 9, 1993. Minasligas
provided average quartz delivery charges in its revised COP/CV response. Petitioners note that the Department's
verification report indicates that averaging freight charges significantly understates Minasligas's type A quartz
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minasligas contends that, while the corrected cost data may result in lower delivered prices for type A quartz, the
revised data result in significantly lower overall replacement costs for that material. Minasligas indicates that
it does not object to use of the quartz replacement costs reported in its original COP/CV response, and notes that the
Department used these costs in the preliminary calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with petitioners. As discussed in the cost verification report (December 17, 1993), the revised costs calculated
by Minasligas and filed with the Department on November 9, 1993 reflect a methodology which understates the delivered
cost of type A quartz, by allocating the delivery charges among all quartz purchases. Accordingly, we have rejected
the revised replacement cost for quartz and relied upon the cost information Minasligas reported in its original
COP/CV response. As Minasligas notes, this is the information we used in reaching the preliminary results of review.

Comment 15:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners state that the Department determined at verification that Minasligas did not include forest amortization
costs in its calculation of charcoal replacement costs. Petitioners argue that omission of these expenses significantly
understates the cost of the charcoal which Minasligas produced. Petitioners contend that the Department should
use the costs associated with Minasligas's purchase of charcoal from unrelated suppliers in the final calculation
of charcoal replacement costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minasligas argues that the charcoal replacement costs it reported in its original COP/CV response were exclusively
based on the delivered price charged to the company by suppliers cutting trees on land that Minasligas did not own.
Minasligas contends that it pays less for charcoal cut from trees on its own land, and that its corrected charcoal costs
are significantly lower than those reported in its original COP/CV response. Minasligas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the Department should use the charcoal replacement costs reported in its original COP/CV response,
if the Department decides not to use the corrected charcoal replacement costs supplied by Minasligas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with petitioners. As discussed in the cost verification report (December 17, 1993), the revised costs calculated
by Minasligas and filed with the Department on November 9, 1993 reflect a methodology which understates the replacement
cost of charcoal by averaging the payment to subcontractors for charcoal obtained from company-owned land with the
higher costs from unrelated charcoal vendors. This calculation does not include any cost to Minasligas for acquiring
forests or planting and maintaining forests. Accordingly, we have rejected the revised replacement cost for charcoal
and relied upon the cost information provided by Minasligas in its original COP/CV response.

Comment 16: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners contend that the Department found at verification that Minasligas had not accurately accounted for
loss allowances for quartz and charcoal used in 1991 silicon metal production. Petitioners contend that the Department
should make an upward adjustment to Minasligas's reported 1991 quartz and charcoal costs to account for this expense.
Petitioners suggest that the Department use the loss allowances provided by Minasligas for 1992 silicon metal production
to make this adjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minasligas contends that the question of whether quartz and charcoal losses were understated prior to 1992 is irrelevant
because Minasligas had no U.S. sales during that time. Minasligas notes that it did provide an acceptable calculation
for charcoal and quartz losses for 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with the petitioners that, prior to 1992, the measured consumption of charcoal and quartz into the furnace
was not consistently and scientifically adjusted to reflect losses sustained between the time the material was delivered
into the factory stockyard and introduced into a furnace. Beginning in 1992, Minasligas established a loss allowance
and consistently applied it to both quartz and charcoal. For 1991 quartz and charcoal, Minasligas estimated loss
allowances and recorded them on an occasional basis. We have recalculated loss allowances for 1991 based upon BIA.
As BIA, we have used the loss allowance established by the company in 1992 and applied this percentage to both quartz
and charcoal consumption for all months in 1991. We disagree with Minasligas's assertion that the 1991 costs are irrelevant,
since they are used to determine whether home market sales were sold at or above their COP.

Comment 17: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners contend that the Department should allocate Minasligas's consumption of iron rods and tubes over all
months of the period of review, instead of accepting Minasligas's approach. (Minasligas recognized the entire expense
associated with these charges in the month in which they were requisitioned out of inventory.) Petitioners suggest
that for those months for which Minasligas did not report iron rods and tube costs, the Department should use the per-unit
output costs for rods and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tubes from the most recent month with an adjustment for inflation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minasligas contends that allocating the consumption of rods and tubes over the period of review would only marginally
change the cost of materials for the month that Minasligas had a U.S. sale. Minasligas contends that more rods were
requisitioned during that month than were consumed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with petitioners that it is more accurate to allocate the number of rods and tubes removed from inventory to
production tons over the period in which they were consumed, rather than just the month of requisition. Accordingly,
we have reallocated the total rods and tubes consumed during the period of review equally to tons produced during this
same time period. Each month's allocated consumption quantity was then valued at the reported replacement cost for
that same month. We also agree with Minasligas that this adjustment does not have a serious impact on the reported cost
information.

Comment 18: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners assert that verification revealed that Minasligas's supplier measures electricity from the fifth
of one month to the fifth of the following month. Petitioners further argue that Minasligas used the invoice received
from its supplier on approximately the tenth of the month to represent the electricity costs for that month. Petitioners
contend that such a methodology understates the replacement costs for electricity since it primarily reflects the
costs incurred during the previous month. Petitioners contend that for each month of the review period the Department
should use the electricity costs reported by Minasligas for the following month.

Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with the petitioners. Minasligas reported the replacement cost of monthly electricity for the month in which
the bill was received. Each month's bill reflects the cost of electricity purchased in the prior month. Therefore,
the reported replacement cost of electricity is understated since it lags the actual cost by one month. We have corrected
for this understatement by matching each month's bill with the month that it covered.

Comment 19:

Petitioners contend that Minasligas's allocation of G&amp;A expenses is incorrect. (Minasligas allocated monthly
G&amp;A expenses to individual products based upon the number of furnaces used in the production of each product.)
Petitioners contend that the Department should allocate G&amp;A expenses to total COGS as was done in the preliminary
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minasligas contends that a larger portion of its operation is devoted to ferrosilicon than to silicon metal. Minasligas
contends that allocating G&amp;A expenses to total COGS overstates the amount of G&amp;A expenses relating to silicon
metal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with petitioners. G&amp;A expenses are period expenses which relate to the operation of the company as a whole
and are not customarily associated with a particular product or process. Therefore, we recalculated G&amp;A expenses
on a company-wide annual historical basis and, in order to avoid overstating G&amp;A expenses and to neutralize hyperinflationary
effects, we applied the G&amp;A ratio to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis.

Comment 20: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners contend that the Department should calculate Minasligas's interest expense as the consolidated expenses
of Minasligas and Delp Engenharia S.A. (Delp). Petitioners note that Delp controls over 93 percent of Minasligas's
common stock and thus has a controlling interest in Minasligas. Petitioners suggest that the Department use Delp's
1991 and 1992 financial statements to perform this calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minasligas contends that Delp and Minasligas are separate entities, maintain separate financial statements, and
have their own interest expense and income. Therefore, Minasligas asserts that it would be improper to calculate
interest expense on a consolidated basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with petitioners that Minasligas should report interest expense on a consolidated basis. See our response
to comment 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of Minasligas, Delp does not consolidate its accounts with Minasligas. In addition, because there are
no significant intercompany transactions between the two companies, we combined the financial expenses of the two
companies and calculated an interest expense as a ratio to cost of sales, effectively creating consolidated accounts.
The Department only allows income generated from investments of working capital, which the company documents as
short-term in nature, to offset interest expense (see, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
55 FR 335, 342 (January 4, 1990)). Minasligas was able to substantiate only a portion of the investments to be short-term;
consequently, we have allowed only the documented portion of interest income as an offset. We did not allow an offset
to Minasligas's parent, Delp, for interest expense because the information required to substantiate such an adjustment
is not contained in the record of this review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to avoid overstating financing charges, we applied the interest expense ratio (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

than to amounts computed under the replacement cost basis. This is consistent with the methodology used in the remand

Comment 21:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners contend that Minasligas did not submit information regarding short-term interest income at the consolidated,
parent company level. Accordingly, the petitioners contend that it is not feasible to ``compute interest expense
using the sum of Minasligas's and Delp's financial expenses adjusted for intercompany interest transactions'',
as suggested by the Department's cost verification report. Finally, petitioners assert that the Department should
apply this allocation to COM to properly account for Brazilian hyperinflation.

Petitioners contend that Minasligas's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses is flawed because Minasligas
failed to properly ``layer'' inventory according to the month that the merchandise was placed in inventory. Petitioners
contend that Minasligas's calculation reflects one level of inventory even though Minasligas held merchandise
in inventory for at least two preceding months. Petitioners contend that this flaw makes Minasligas's calculation
unusable. Accordingly, petitioners contend that the Department should disregard Minasligas's calculation, and
make no adjustment for inventory holding gain or loss in the final COP calculations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners contend that the Department should disallow the portion of Minasligas's duty drawback claim pertaining

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree with petitioners. Article 314 of the Brazilian Customs Regulations provides for the ``suspension of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 due when importing merchandise to be exported *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (Emphasis added.) The suspension is not limited
to customs duties. It includes all ``tributes'' paid upon importation of the merchandise. IPI and ICMS taxes incurred
on imported electrodes are two such tributes which are suspended upon exportation of the merchandise. Thus, Minasligas

Comment 24:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners contend that the Department should use adverse, noncooperative BIA for RIMA. Petitioners make reference
to the Department's December 22, 1993 verification report regarding RIMA's COP/CV response. That report indicated
that RIMA: (1) Was unwilling to supply the Department with necessary worksheets, schedules, or source documents,
(2) that the aspect of RIMA's COP/CV response pertaining to related party transactions, G&amp;A expenses, finance
costs, and profit were not verified, (3) that RIMA's calculation of charcoal and quartz costs were not reflective
of monthly replacement costs, and (4) that RIMA did not adjust the value of its electrode purchases to account for inflation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners assert that the verification report indicates that RIMA based its cost response on a managerial cost
accounting system that was not used for purposes of valuing inventory in the financial statements. As such, petitioners
contend that RIMA's submitted cost information could not be reconciled with RIMA's financial statements. According
to petitioners, the verification report also indicates that RIMA based its calculation of labor hours on theoretical
times and that actual labor hours exceeded these theoretical hours by a significant amount. Finally, petitioners
find that the Department determined that RIMA's COP response did not account for costs associated with write-downs
or obsolescence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners contend that RIMA's refusal to provide requested information significantly impeded the completion
of this review. In accordance with the Department's practice, petitioners argue that the Department should assign
as BIA the higher of the highest prior margin established for any company or the highest margin determined in this administrative
review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At verification we encountered serious and pervasive problems in our efforts to verify the information submitted
by RIMA. We found that these problems were so extensive that we could not test major areas of the response. For those
areas we tested, we found significant discrepancies in the amounts reported, in addition to a lack of sufficient data
to corroborate the response. We outlined the major deficiencies that we found during verification in the public version
of the cost verification report (December 22, 1993) and the RIMA calculation memorandum, both of which are on file
in the Central Records Unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Department cannot properly base its determination on the information submitted
by RIMA. The Department cannot be placed in the position of having to identify and perform numerous and substantial
revisions to develop accurate cost data, if indeed such revisions were even possible in this case. As stated in

It is the obligation of respondents to provide an accurate and complete response prior to verification so that the
Department may have the opportunity to analyze fully the information and other parties are able to review and comment
on it. Verification is intended to establish the accuracy and completeness of a response rather than to supplement
and reconstruct the information to fit the requirements of the Department.

Petitioners contend that it is the Department's established practice to exclude from the dumping calculations sales
that were sold during the review period but shipped outside the period of review. Because Eletrosilex's only sale
was shipped after the close of this review period, petitioners argue that Eletrosilex had no sales subject to review
for the current 1991&hyph;1992 administrative review. Petitioners contend that the Department should maintain
the 91.06 percent all others rate for

We disagree. Section 353.22(b) of our regulations stipulates that administrative reviews ``normally will cover,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We based this review upon sales because (1) the selling price and each of the expenses associated with this sale were
known by Eletrosilex and reported to the Department at an early stage of the review process, and (2) use of this sale
in our margin calculations constitutes the most accurate reflection of Eletrosilex's pricing practices during
the review period. Moreover, we note that we have based some other administrative reviews upon sales rather than entries

Comment 26: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CBCC and RIMA contend that the Department violated the statute and the regulations by failing to publish the final
results of review by July 31, 1993. CBCC and RIMA note that section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act stipulates that the Department
will issue a final determination ``(A)t least once during each 12-month period'', and that &sect;353.22(c)(7) of
the regulations indicates that the Department will publish a final determination ``not later than 365 days after
the anniversary month.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CBCC and RIMA contend that the Department abused its discretion by conducting a verification of sales and cost data
since these verifications further delayed the issuance of the final results. CBCC and RIMA suggest that the final
results should be based upon the record that existed on July 31, 1993, and that the record at that time indicated no dumping
margins for either company.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree. The CIT has determined that the completion of administrative reviews within the one-year time period
is ``directory'' rather than ``mandatory'' (see

796 F. Supp. 517,523 (CIT 1992)). While we strive to complete administrative reviews within a year, the issuance of
our final results is sometimes delayed by other regulatory and statutory requirements associated with the administration
of the antidumping law.

In this case, petitioners demonstrated that ``good cause'' existed for verification pursuant to 19 C.F.R. &sect;353.22(c)
and 353.36(a). Specifically, petitioners noted potential deficiencies in the replacement cost data provided by
CBCC and RIMA. Because ``good cause'' existed for verification, our decision to verify the COP responses of CBCC and

Minasligas indicates that it agrees with the statement in the Department's cost verification report (December 17,

quantity would result in lower fabrication charges than those reported in its questionnaire response. (Minasligas
allocated these charges on the number of furnaces in its COP/CV response.)

59 FR 732, 739, January 6, 1994, we have determined that the number of furnaces is not an adequate basis for allocating
labor or other fabrication costs. The number of furnaces in a facility is an arbitrary measure which does not necessarily
reflect the actual level of labor and overhead expended in the production of the subject merchandise. In the instant
case, output tons is a more accurate allocation basis because these costs are directly related to production amounts.
Therefore, we have revised the submitted costs to reflect an allocation based on actual production units.

Eletrosilex contends that the Department incorrectly based its conversions of certain cruzeiro-denominated expenses
(inland freight, port charges, ocean freight, warehousing, and packing) on the U.S. sale date. Eletrosilex argues
that the Department's policy in countries with hyperinflationary economies is to base currency conversions on the
date that the expenses were incurred. Eletrosilex requests that the Department follow this policy with respect to
the conversion into dollars of the cruzeiro-denominated expenses outlined above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eletrosilex contends that the allocation of G&amp;A and selling expenses that the Department used in its preliminary
results is improper because it does not accurately reflect Eletrosilex's experience as a silicon metal producer
and seller during the period of review. Eletrosilex notes that the Department relied upon the 1991 financial statement
to perform this calculation, and that these financial statements do not fully reflect Eletrosilex's experience
for the review period. Eletrosilex contends 1991 was an ``aberrational year'' in which it incurred G&amp;A and selling
expenses which were unrelated to the production of silicon metal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eletrosilex indicates that on March 10, 1993, it submitted total G&amp;A and selling expenses by month for every month
included in the period of review. Eletrosilex urges the Department to derive G&amp;A and selling expenses by summing
all selling expenses and dividing the total amount of these expenses by the total COM that Eletrosilex reported for
the period March 29, 1991 through June 30, 1992.

As noted in our response to Comment 11, our current practice in cases in which the economy is hyperinflationary is to
apply the G&amp;A and selling expenses ratio to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis. We did not ask Eletrosilex
to supply historical COM information in this review. Accordingly, as a reasonable alternative to our current practice,
we have summed all selling expenses reported by Eletrosilex for the period of review, and divided this total amount
by the total COM that Eletrosilex reported for the review period.

RIMA contends that the Department's December 22, 1993 COP/CV verification report incorrectly characterized its
personnel as ``unwilling'' to supply worksheets, schedules, and source documents. RIMA states that it cooperated
with the verification team and that the difficulties encountered during the verification were due to: (1) The fact
that the verification outline was not made available to RIMA until a week before commencement of the verification,
(2) the company had never previously undergone a verification, (3) there had been a good deal of turnover in the company
and the personnel responsible for the verification did not participate in the preparation of the response, and (4)
the verification began on Saturday, continued through Sunday, and a Brazilian national holiday.

Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree with RIMA. RIMA's suggestion that the company's problems relate to having only one week of preparation
time after receipt of the verification agenda is completely erroneous. The verification outline was in fact released
to counsel for RIMA on October 28, 1993, and verification of RIMA's cost response began on November 13, 1993. Thus the
agenda was available more than two weeks prior to the start of verification. Further, the verification agenda merely
indicates the Department's approach to performing the verification. Any suggestion that the company did not realize
the Department intended to review the underlying source documents is unsupported. The fact that the Department is
particularly concerned with each company's methodology for linking the cost response to its cost and financial accounting
system is indicated in the Department's questionnaire (September 1, 1992), which requires the company to provide
detailed explanations of this connection. The questionnaire also instructed company personnel to contact the Department
if for any reason they did not intend to rely on the company's cost accounting records to prepare the response (September
1, 1992 at page 53). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RIMA's further assertions that the company's problems related to conducting verification on a weekend and a lack
of verification experience are not persuasive. Company personnel and their counsel knew well in advance of the need
to schedule verification time on the weekends; in fact, counsel for each of the respondents, including counsel for
RIMA, provided input in setting the verification schedule for this case. It should also be noted that the Department's
personnel conducting the verification noted no improvement in the company's ability to provide verification support
as the verification progressed into the regular work week. Indeed we know of no reasons why it would improve on a particular
day of the week since the information the Department requested should be available within the company, and all of the
company personnel who participated in the verification were available on the weekend. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not unusual for a respondent to be unfamiliar with the verification process and the Department does not expect
such experience. However, if company personnel are unable to explain the methodology followed in preparing the response
and provide the source documents which were relied upon, we are not able to conclude that this is simply a result of being
unfamiliar with the verification process.

Comment 31: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RIMA argues that it used a reasonable methodology to report quartz and charcoal costs. RIMA contends that it used its
financial accounting system to price these inputs because (1) its cost system does not use replacement values, and
(2) the cost system was subject to distortions that were known to RIMA's management. Moreover, RIMA argues that the
variations between these two cost systems were minor, and that RIMA provided the most accurate information in its
COP/CV response that it could. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RIMA argues that the COP/CV verification report indicates that RIMA's production standard specifies the use of specific
types of charcoal and quartz. However, RIMA, in practice, sometimes used other types of these materials, depending
on availability. RIMA contends that use of these other materials resulted in a lower calculated cost than RIMA reported
in its COP/CV response.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree with RIMA's assertions that its reported material cost were overstated. As discussed in the cost verification
report, the monthly replacement costs noted for certain of the materials actually used in production were higher
than the unit costs for the specific materials which RIMA had indicated were used in production. Thus these unit prices
were understated.

RIMA asserts that it provided ``critical source documentation'' concerning the quantity of inputs used in the production
of silicon metal, contrary to the assertion of the Department's verification report. RIMA contends that during the
verification it made the ``underlying statistical measurements'' available for inspection by the verification

of papers involved.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Department's Position:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree with RIMA's contention that it provided source documents. We also disagree with RIMA's assertion that
we expected the company to provide daily or hourly source documents. RIMA was expected to provide an accurate response
to the Department's specific requests for information. As discussed in the Department's verification report (December
22, 1993), prior to verification RIMA completely failed to indicate the true nature of its cost and financial accounting
systems, and even stated that the systems reflect the same costs. RIMA also indicated that its cost accounting system
was relied upon in preparing the submitted cost information. We found each of these assertions to be inaccurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although RIMA was able to provide pages of graphs which purportedly reflected the actual material consumption, RIMA
was unable to reconcile this information to either the cost or financial accounting system. Thus, the reported material
consumption quantities were presented to the Department quite literally in a complete vacuum, merely a handful of
graphs, unreconcilable to any other recorded measure of material consumption. This was the extent of the underlying
statistical measurements which were made available to the Department for inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in our response to comment 24, the discrepancies noted in the material quantity input together with other
significant inconsistencies have caused us to reject RIMA's cost submission.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RIMA argues that it is unfair for the Department to penalize the company for having a cost accounting system that does
not tie to its financial accounting system. RIMA contends that its former cost accounting system was not designed
to tie into its financial accounting system, and argues that rejection of its response is equivalent to a penalty for

Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is not penalizing RIMA for having any particular type of accounting system. RIMA's cost information
was rejected for the specific reasons which are outlined in the public version of the cost verification report and
the calculation memorandum. We found that these problems were so extensive that major areas of the response could
not be tested. For those areas which were tested we found significant discrepancies in the amounts reported, in addition
to a lack of sufficient data to corroborate the response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we are unable to understand RIMA's argument that rejection of its response is equivalent to a penalty for
providing accurate data. The record does not begin to establish that the information provided by RIMA is accurate

RIMA argues that the Department's COP/CV verification report erroneously characterized the reported labor hours
as ``theoretical'' rather than ``actual''. RIMA states that it used its statistical process control reports to calculate
labor expense, and asserts that this constitutes a more accurate way of reporting this expense than would have been
reflected in RIMA's ``managerial'' costing system.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Department's Position:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree that the cost verification report provides an erroneous characterization. The Department's cost verification
report outlines the findings at verification. As the report indicates, the analysis upon which the reported labor
cost was based is no longer performed by RIMA and was never used for any purpose other than the company's submission.
Based upon the company's inability to relate this analysis to any other recorded measure of costs, we cannot conclude
that the information provided reflected a ``more accurate'' measure of the costs.

Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with RIMA that several of the home market transactions which are characterized as unreported sales in our
December 23, 1993 verification report were in fact commercial samples or intracompany transfers. We note, however,
that our determination to use BIA for RIMA was based upon RIMA's inability to provide reliable cost data. The commercial
samples and intracompany transfers referenced in the December 23, 1993 sales verification report were not factors
in our decision to use BIA for RIMA.

Comment 36: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RIMA argues that the home market sales that it did not report made no difference in the determination of market viability
or foreign market value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in our response to comment 24 we used BIA for RIMA because RIMA was unable to provide reliable cost data. Thus,
the question of whether these unreported sales would have made a difference in the determination of foreign market
value is moot.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Addendum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have made an additional change in our analysis for these final results: We have amended our COP calculations to adjust
for the amount of the Brazilian inflation that was factored into the home market selling price. To make this adjustment,
we compared Minasligas's and Eletrosilex's selling prices to their respective COPs in effect as of the date of payment
rather than the date of sale.

after the publication date, as provided by Section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, and will remain in effect until the
final results of the next administrative review: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed companies will be those
listed above, (2) for previously investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit will continue to be the
company-specific rate published for the most recent period, (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review,
or the original investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the
most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise, and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers
or exporters will be the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice of the LTFV investigation of this case,

This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order
is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months)
from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 1995, is estimated at $198,971. The total Federal amount is $169,125 and is composed
of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,125. The application must include a minimum cost share of 15% $29,846 in
non-federal (cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $198,971. Cost-sharing contributions may
be in the form of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations
thereof. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(25 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs,'' is not applicable to this program. Federal funds for this project include audit funds for non-CPA recipients.
In the event that a CPA firm wins the competition, the funds allocated for audits are not applicable. Questions concerning
the preceding information can be answered by the contact person indicated above, and copies of application kits and
applicable regulations can be obtained at the above address. The collection of information requirements for this
project have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB control number 0640&hyph;0006.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(25 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award.

Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice is published pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 47(a)(2) and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2&hyph;3. Its purpose is to provide interested
persons an opportunity to submit comments on the possible impact of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Additions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Committee approves the proposed addition, all entities of the Federal Government (except as otherwise indicated)
will be required to procure the commodities and services listed below from nonprofit agencies employing persons
who are blind or have other severe disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
major factors considered for this certification were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small
entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and services to the Government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement
List. Comments on this certification are invited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On November 5, 1993, April 22, June 3 and 24, 1994, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disabled published notices (58 FR 39013, 59 FR 19164, 28847 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 32686) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has determined that the commodities and services listed below are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors considered for this certification were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities and services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current contractors for the commodities and services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commodities and services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed for addition to the Procurement List.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 17, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 FR 31218) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed addition to the Procurement List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received from two cap manufacturers. Both firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noted the serious decline in military uniform headwear purchases of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recent years and indicated that the loss of any more headwear items 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from competitive purchasing would further reduce the competitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market and increase their chances of going out of business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee is aware of the decline in Government purchasing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clothing items. However, it should be noted that nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies participating in the Committee's program which produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
military uniform items are also experiencing the results of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decline, and their employees with severe disabilities have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traditionally had higher rates of unemployment, and thus more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficulty in securing other work, than workers without disabilities employed by commercial uniform item manufacturers.
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit agency which will produce the cap under the Committee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program is also recovering from the employment losses caused by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severe hurricane which closed the military base on which the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was performing other contracts under the Committee's program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that neither of the commenters is currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producing the cap for the Government, as the current competitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract was won by the nonprofit agency which will produce the cap 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Committee's program. Accordingly, the commenters will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not lose anything they currently have, other than a chance to bid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on future competitive contracts for the cap. Because there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guarantee under the competitive bidding system that any particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company will get a contract, the Committee does not consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of this chance to constitute severe adverse impact on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodity, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the commodity listed below are suitable for procurement by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors considered for this certification were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current contractors for the commodities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commodities to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41

The Corporation is a new government corporation that encompasses the work and staff of two previously existing federal
agencies, the Commission on National and Community Service and ACTION. The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans
of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service. This service will address the nation's education, public
safety, human, and environmental needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation
will foster civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide education opportunity
for those who make a substantial commitment to service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corporation is establishing a new national service initiative called AmeriCorps that includes a wide variety
of programs operated by grantees which will be local and national non-profits, state and local government agencies,
Indian tribes and territories. The Corporation will also support service-learning initiatives for elementary
and secondary schools and institutions of higher education called Learn and Serve America and operate the senior
volunteers programs previously supported by ACTION. Some of the national service programs will be operating this
summer, and most of the others will be operational by this fall.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Corporation is striving to build partnerships between AmeriCorps programs and television stations in order
to promote national service. Through this partnership, television stations will help further national service
by assisting AmeriCorps programs with community awareness and recruitment and educating the American public about
the impact of national service via public service announcements and an educational documentary. To achieve this
end, the Corporation requests that television stations nationwide volunteer to serve as flagship television stations
to help promote AmeriCorps programs and national service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All interested television stations should contact Wendy Grassi at (202) 606&hyph;5000 extension 262. Ms. Grassi
will provide further information about existing AmeriCorps programs and how to become a flagship television station
for AmeriCorps programs.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Kennecott Copper proposes to expand their current tailings impoundment by an additional 3,500 acres. The present
tailings impoundment is reaching its storage capacity. Kennecott projects the need to store an additional 1.9 billion
tons of tailings in order for operation and production to continue throughout the life of the mine. In addition, Kennecott
has identified the need for a seismic upgrade of the existing impoundment. The intended location of the expanded facility
and its design is projected to meet this need. Construction of the north expansion will require a Department of the
Army permit pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The Corps of Engineers, as the lead Federal agency for this
project, has determined that an Environmental Impact Statement will be required prior to making a permit decision.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Kennecott Copper owns and operates the Bingham Canyon Mine 30 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah within the Oquirrh
Mountains. Copper ore is mined from an open pit mine and processed at the concentrator, smelter and refinery facilities.
Annual production of copper from the facility is over 250,000 tons annually, Tailings, the end-product of the process,
are disposed in a slurry to an existing impoundment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing impoundment's footprint covers approximately 5,700 acres and contains 1.7 billion tons of tailings.
The current impoundment is 190 feet high. It has the capacity for an additional 0.3 to 0.4 billion tons of tailings which
will raise its height to 250 feet. Its capacity is projected to be reached by 1998. However, the expected life of the
mine is estimated at an additional 30 years with a total production of 1.9 billion more tons of tailings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Construction of the North Expansion will occur in two phases. The Phase 1 design will provide for 1.1 billion tons of
tailings storage. (An additional 0.3 to 0.4 billion tons of tailings will be deposited into the existing impoundment
during the remaining years of service.) Related project elements for Phase 1 include construction of the North Expansion
berm, expanded dewatering of select reaches of the existing impoundment, and modification of the process water system,
all designed to enhance the seismic stability of the existing impoundment. Phase 1 is expected to run from year 1999
to 2018.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase 2 construction of the North Expansion will allow storage of an additional 0.4 to 0.5 billion tons of tailings,
resulting in a final impoundment height of 250 feet by the year 2027.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Construction of the North Expansion will require a new pipeline bridge and modification of the tailings distribution
system. It will also involve relocating utility lines, powerlines, the C&hyph;7 ditch, the Union Pacific Railroad
main lines, the construction of a new bridge for Highway 202 over the relocated railroad lines and the modification
of Interstate 80 on and off ramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the proposed North Expansion, other alternatives have tentatively been identified. These include
both onsite and offsite alternatives. The onsite alternatives range from the proposed North Expansion to the continued
raising and impounding of tailings within the existing impoundment. Offsite alternatives would involve separate
sites capable of meeting the tailings storage capacity needs. Five have been identified: Barneys Canyon, Coon Canyon,
Dry Fork/Carr Fork, Tooele/Carr Fork and Stockton. All sites are located in the Oquirrh Mountains and within Kennecott
Copper's mine properties. Alternatives and their practicability will be analyzed by the Corps of Engineers pursuant
to the 404(b)(1) Guidelines contained in 40 CFR Part 230.

A public scoping meeting will be held to help identify significant issues and alternatives for inclusion in the DEIS.
Potentially significant issues to be analyzed in the DEIS include wetland impacts, impacts to surface and ground
water, both in terms of quantity and quality; public safety, air quality, fish and wildlife impacts, transportation
and traffic. A public scoping meeting will be held at the following time and location: 6 p.m., Wednesday, September
19, 1994: Main Auditorium, Utah Department of Natural Resources, 1636 West North Temple, Salt Lake City, Utah.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal, state and local agencies as well as other interested parties are encouraged to attend the scoping meeting.
In addition, written comments addressing relevant issues to be considered in the DEIS as per this NOI may be sent to
Mr. Schwinn at the above address. Comments in response to this NOI will be received until the date of the scoping meeting.

Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 authorizes various forms of Government assistance to encourage
expansion of production capacity and supply of industrial resources essential to national defense. The DPA Amendments
of 1992 provide for the testing, qualification, and use of industrial resources manufactured or developed with assistance
provided under Title III of the DPA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAR case 93&hyph;304 requires contractors, upon the direction of the contracting office, to test Title III industrial
resources for qualification, and provide the test results to the Defense Production Act Office. The interim rule
expresses Government policy to pay for such testing and provides definitions, procedures, and a contract clause
to implement the policy. This information is used by the Defense Production Act Office, Title III Program, to determine
whether the Title III industrial resource has been provided an impartial opportunity to qualify.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
gives blind persons, who are trained and licensed by State vocational rehabilitation agencies (called ``State licensing
agencies'' or SLAs), a priority to operate vending facilities on Federal property. The Act further provides for arbitration
to resolve disputes that arise under the program between individual vendors and SLAs and between SLAs and Federal
agencies. 20 U.S.C. 107d&hyph;1(a) and (b). For each of these two categories of arbitrations, the Secretary authorizes
the convening of an arbitration panel upon receipt of a complaint filed by either a vendor against an SLA or by an SLA
against a Federal agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 U.S.C. 107d&hyph;2(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act directs each of the parties to an arbitration to each appoint one arbitrator (or panel member) and directs the
two party-appointed arbitrators to select a neutral chairperson. 20 U.S.C. 107d&hyph;2(b) (1) and (2). In order
to facilitate this process, the Department sends to the parties names of potential chairpersons from the Roster of
Arbitrators maintained by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). If the parties seek to appoint
a chairperson who is not listed on the FMCS roster, a biographical sketch of that chairperson is to be sent to the Department.
Once selected, the panel conducts a hearing and renders a decision, which is subject to appeal and review as a ``final
agency action'' for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act. 20 U.S.C. 107d&hyph;2(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act, in 20 U.S.C. 107d&hyph;2(d), requires the Secretary to pay all reasonable costs of arbitration in accordance
with a schedule of fees and expenses that the Secretary publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Pursuant to this requirement, the Department has continued to pay certain costs associated with arbitration proceedings
authorized by the Secretary, but has not published the schedule referred to in the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this notice is to propose a schedule of fees and expenses under section 107d&hyph;2(d) of the Act. The
proposed schedule outlines the types of costs that the Secretary considers reasonable costs of arbitration and the
standards by which the Secretary will determine the rate of payment for these costs. Generally, the Secretary considers
reasonable costs of arbitration to include the cost of preparing the official record of arbitration proceedings,
professional fees for arbitration panel members, and food, travel, and lodging expenses of panel members and essential
witnesses. The Secretary does not consider attorneys' fees to be part of the reasonable costs of arbitration, but
rather considers them the responsibility of each party to the arbitration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has drawn guidance from information and data supplied by the FMCS in formulating these proposed standards.

Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulatory documents that are easy to understand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary invites comments on how to make this proposed schedule easier to understand, including answers to questions
such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed schedule clearly stated? (2) Does the schedule contain
technical terms or other wording that interferes with its clarity? (3) Does the format of the schedule (grouping and
order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce its clarity? Would the schedule be easier to
understand if it was divided into more (but shorter) sections? (4) Is the description of the schedule in the ``Supplementary
Information'' section of this preamble helpful in understanding the schedule? How could this description be more
helpful in making the schedule easier to understand? (5) What else could the Department do to make the schedule easier
to understand? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of any comments that concern how the Department could make this proposed schedule easier to understand should
be sent to Stanley M. Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW (room
5125, FOB&hyph;6), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2241.

The Secretary certifies that this proposed schedule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this proposed schedule would affect only States, State agencies, and individuals, the schedule would not
have an impact on small entities. States, State agencies, and individuals are not defined as ``small entities'' in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes that the reasonable costs of arbitration under 20 U.S.C. 107d&hyph;2(d) are the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Stenographic Record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) General Provisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department will pay the costs of the services of the official reporter assigned to the arbitration, including
preparation of the official transcript of the hearing and six copies thereof. The official transcript and one copy
thereof must be submitted to the Department. The remaining five copies of the transcript must be distributed among
the parties as determined by the arbitration panel chairperson. Costs of the services of the official reporter may
not exceed the reasonable and customary costs for those services in the locality in which the services are furnished.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cancellation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The official reporter may charge the Department its customary fee for cancellation of an arbitration proceeding
in situations in which a proceeding is canceled within 24 hours of its scheduled date and time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fees of Arbitrators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Per Diem. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department will pay a per diem fee to arbitration panel members, who are not otherwise employed by the Federal or
State Government, for their services during the course of the arbitration. The per diem fee to be paid by the Department
must be the lesser of_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The customary fee charged by the individual panel member; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The reasonable and customary fee charged by arbitrators in the locality where the arbitration will be held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postponement or Cancellation within 48 hours. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a scheduled arbitration proceeding is postponed or canceled within 48 hours of its scheduled date and time, panel
members may charge the Department_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A predetermined, customary, and reasonable postponement or cancellation fee; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) That portion of the arbitrator's per diem fee proportional to the actual time the panel member expended in preparing
for the proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Postponements or Cancellations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a scheduled arbitration proceeding is postponed or canceled more than 48 hours prior to its scheduled date, panel
members may charge the Department only that portion of the per diem fee proportional to the actual time expended in
preparing for the proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The customary per diem and predetermined fees charged by a panel member must be included in a biographical sketch that
is to be sent to the Department following his or her appointment to the panel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Travel, Lodging, and Meal Expenses of Arbitrators and Witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Arbitrators. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding that the Secretary urges the parties to appoint panel representatives from the locality in which
the dispute arose and the hearing is to be held, the Department will reimburse the travel, lodging, and food expenses
of the arbitration panel members incurred for the purpose of attending hearings and for the purpose of attending any
pre- or post-hearing conferences that cannot be conducted by telephone. These expenses will be reimbursed at the
rate applicable to Federal Government employees traveling on government business to the hearing location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary urges the two panel representatives appointed by the parties to select a neutral chairperson from the
locality in which the dispute arose and the hearing is to be held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Witnesses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 The Region VI peer exchange program will provide hands-on training for state Weatherization Assistance Program
(WAP) personnel. This program will provide assistance to each state to send state WAP personnel to another WAP office
to observe procedures used by that state to operate the WAP within their state. Similar funding has not been provided
in previous fiscal years. Results of the Peer Exchange Program will have a favorable impact on the delivery of the weatherization
services to the program clients. The DOE anticipates awarding $2,000.00 to each state to support the Peer Exchange
Program over a project period of 12 months.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14(f), DOE announces its intent to award a grant based on an unsolicited application from the
National Urban Coalition, Washington, DC, to provide Clark County School District, Nevada, with the unique approach
of teaching science and math to minority students through the ``Say YES'' project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of special importance in the ``Say YES'' approach to teaching science and math to minority students is the highly-developed,
culturally-affirmative, and historically-accurate training curriculum. The curriculum illuminates the dynamic
role of all societies in the development and evolution of math and science. Children, as well as their families and
teachers, learn of the contribution their cultures have made to those fields. They come to see and value themselves
as carrying forward a great tradition within their own group of excellence in math, science, and technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objectives of this project are: (1) to nurture and sustain children's interest in science and math; (2) to train
teachers in better presentation of math and science ideas; (3) to assist students in developing creative and efficient
techniques in problem-solving in science and math through hands-on activity; (4) to aid parents in developing skills
needed for effective partnering with their children in the learning process; (5) to provide appropriate experiences
to assist students in developing an appreciation for the importance of math, science, and critical thinking skills
for successful living; (6) to provide students with information and discuss with them the educational and experimental
requirements for careers in math, science, and related fields; (7) to provide opportunities whereby students will
learn to apply and evaluate communicated ideals relative to relevant issues and current developments in math and
science; (8) to affirm the role of all races and cultures in the history of math and science; (9) to describe and demonstrate
to students the techniques for communicating ideals and issues using the language of math and science with peers and
family members; and (10) to describe and discuss with parents and other interested family members appropriate procedures
for becoming advocates for their children's access to higher level courses, programs, and experience in math and
science.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project period for the proposed grant award is five years, to be funded annually. The first year funding is $405,068.
The total estimated cost of this award is $1,893,345. This notice is published for public comment at least 14 days prior
to making the award.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Vancouver Lowlands Wildlife Mitigation Project area is located along the western border of Clark County, extending
north and west of the City of Vancouver, Washington. It consists of approximately 2123 hectares (5245 acres) of riparian,
wetland and pasture habitat along the Columbia River floodplain. The Columbia River borders the southern and western
boundaries of the project area (T2N, R1E, Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 20; T2N, R1W, Sections 1 and 12; T3N, R1W, Sections
35, 36, and 37; T3N, R1E, Sections 30 and 31.) Major riparian and wetland features of the area include the Columbia River,
Vancouver Lake, Lake River, Buckmire and Matthew Sloughs, Shillapoo Lakebed, and Post Office, Round, Green, Curtis,
and Campbell lakes. Several smaller wetlands occur throughout the project area. Land ownership within the project
area includes Washington Department of Wildlife, Clark County, Port of Vancouver, Washington Department of Natural
Resources and several private landowners. BPA proposes to fund implementation of a wildlife management strategy
that would protect, enhance and restore wildlife habitat in the Vancouver Lowlands. Existing wetlands would be maintained
or restored where possible, and enhanced to improve wildlife habitat. Enhancement activities could include control
or removal of non-native fish and plant species and agricultural cultivation, planting and irrigation.

The Western Pond Turtle Wildlife Mitigation Project spans the entire Willamette River Hydrographic Basin, thus
including the Willamette River floodplain. the townships and ranges that approximately compose the basin are: T3N,
R5W&hyph;R2W; T2N, R5W&hyph;R2W; T1N, R5W&hyph;R7E; T1S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T2S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T3S, R5W&hyph;R7E;

T22S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T23S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T24S, R5W&hyph;R7E; T25S, R3E&hyph;R7E. Within the boundaries of the
Willamette River Hydrographic Basin, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife's (ODFW) Western Pond Turtle Management
Plan offers a system of nodes and corridors as potential mitigation lands. This proposal is called the Willamette
Ecosystem Reserve Matrix (WERM). The major WERM nodes that include wetlands are: the Fern Ridge Reservoir area, the
West Eugene Wetlands area, the Finley National Wildlife Refuge area, and the Buckhead Slough-Hospital Creek area.
Land ownership within the project area includes the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Fish
and Wildlife Service, the United States Forest Service, the United States Bureau of Land Management, the State of
Oregon, Lane County, the Nature Conservancy, and several private parties. BPA proposes to fund implementation of
the ODFW Western Pond Turtle Management Plan in order to protect, enhance and restore western pond turtle habitat
in the Willamette River Hydrographic Basin. Enhancement activities could include control or removal of non-native
fish and plant species, the restoration of native vegetation, coalescence and/or augmentations of western pond
turtle populations in secure habitats, application of wire enclosures to protect nests, and/or alterations of current
land management/use patterns.

Applicant seeks authorization for the abandonment of certain compression facilities and appurtenances purchased
to facilitate the transportation of gas produced from the Eugene Island Block 309 G Platform, under terms of gas purchase
contracts between Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission), Applicant's affiliate, and
Forest Oil Corporation (Forest Oil) and Columbia Gas Development Corporation (Columbia Development). Applicant
states that Columbia Transmission has ceased purchasing from both companies and the facilities are no longer needed
for system supply. Therefore, Applicant, Forest Oil and Columbia Development have entered into an agreement dated
January 24, 1994, for the purchase and sale of Applicant's 50% interest in the facilities for the sum of $29,375. Forest
Oil and Columbia Development would assume all responsibilities and liability for the future operation, maintenance
and retirement of the facilities. Applicant states that none of its transportation in Eugene Island Block 309 would
be affected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the authorities contained in 12 U.S.C. 1821(c), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

The FDIC has determined that the proceeds which can be realized from the liquidation of the assets of the below listed
receivership estate are insufficient to wholly satisfy the priority claims of depositors against the receivership
estate. Therefore, upon satisfaction of secured claims, depositor claims and claims which have priority over depositors
under applicable law, no amount will remain or will be recovered sufficient to allow a dividend, distribution or payment
to any creditor of lessor priority, including but not limited to, claims of general creditors. Any such claims are
hereby determined to be worthless.

 The Board is requesting comment on a proposal to modify the methodology for imputing clearing balance income to more
closely parallel the practices of a private sector service provider. Specifically, the Board is requesting comment
on a proposal to change the rate used to impute clearing balance income from the 90-day Treasury bill coupon equivalent
yield to a longer term Treasury rate based on the earning asset maturity structure of the largest bank holding companies
(BHCs). The intended effect of the proposal is to promote competitive equity with private sector practices by matching
the maturity structure for investment of clearing balances to the structure revealed in bank holding company data
on investments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Monetary Control Act (MCA) requires the Federal Reserve Banks to establish fees for their services on a basis similar
to private sector service providers. In establishing fees, the Board considers objectives of fostering competition,
improving the efficiency of the payments mechanism, and providing financial services nationwide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Federal Reserve imputes costs in the private sector adjustment factor (PSAF) that are intended
to mirror private sector sales taxes, income taxes, cost of funds, and FDIC assessments. Capital structure, equity
and debt rates, and an income tax rate are derived from a model of the largest (in asset size) 50 bank holding companies.
The Federal Reserve uses the bank holding company model to place Reserve Bank payment service costs on an equal footing
with those costs incurred by the private sector. The banking industry has accepted the BHC model as a proxy for determining
Federal Reserve imputed costs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In February 1981, the Federal Reserve established procedures to assist depository institutions with clearing arrangements
at Reserve Banks, recognizing that the maintenance of an account relationship is necessary for (a) depository institutions
that do not maintain reserve accounts but desire direct access to some or all Federal Reserve priced services and (b)
depository institutions that do maintain a reserve account but find the reserve balance inadequate for their transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because clearing balances were established as a result of depository institutions wanting access to Federal Reserve
priced services, it was determined that investment earnings attributable to clearing balances should be ascribed
to the System's priced service operations, comparable to the use of these balances by other service providers. The
1982 annual financial report of the Federal Reserve reflected these earnings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This priced service revenue factor, net income on clearing balances (NICB), is the difference between the income
the Federal Reserve imputes on clearing balances held with the Federal Reserve System, less imputed reserve requirements,
and the priced services cost of earnings credits granted to depository institutions, net of expired earnings credits.
(Appendix A illustrates the current NICB calculation.) The private sector recognizes revenue from these balances
in a similar way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1982, under its delegated authority rules, the Board approved a rate of return equivalent to the yield on the short-term
assets included in the System Open Market Account portfolio for calculating clearing balance income. The Federal
Reserve selected the 90-day Treasury bill coupon equivalent yield to impute income on clearing balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A primary benefit of the 90-day Treasury rate, which is still used today, is that its yield is equivalent to the yield
on short-term assets currently included in the Federal Reserve's System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio. Additionally,
use of the short-term 90-day rate was viewed as more closely approximating what would have been realized had clearing
balance funds been held and invested by a private business firm. Lastly, Treasury yield data are available to the public.
This allows the earnings calculation to be replicated by the private sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Reserve System recently reviewed the methodology used to impute income on clearing balances to determine the
comparability of Federal Reserve practices in this area with practices of correspondent banks. A telephone survey
of bank holding companies was conducted to determine the types of assets in which correspondent banks invest clearing
balance funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Survey results showed that, although correspondent banks pay earnings credits based on a short-term rate (90-day
Treasury bill), their investment of clearing balance funds is determined by the economic environment, their risk
policies, and investment opportunities available. The survey participants identified a range of investment options
including, loans, securities, and overnight funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was observed that correspondent banks may exercise a broad range of investment opportunities whereas the Federal
Reserve has adopted a more restrictive practice. Since Reserve Bank imputed investments do not reflect correspondent
bank practices, the approach is inconsistent with other areas of priced service accounting. Other areas of priced
service accounting either draw on actual Reserve Bank costs, or are imputed based on BHC data. More important, over
time, by computing clearing balance income in the current fashion, the Federal Reserve may be understating clearing
balance revenue, increasing costs of Federal Reserve priced services, and setting prices higher than necessary
to promote effective competition and efficient payment services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal under consideration by the Board of Governors is to determine the maturity structure of short-, intermediate-,
and long-term securities assets from the BHC model and impute income based on published matching term Treasury yields.
The Board is considering the BHC structure/Treasury yields method because it promotes competitive equity with private
sector practices by matching the maturity structure for investment of clearing balances to the structure revealed
in bank holding company data on investments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One problem with attempting to match the earnings realized by bank holding companies is that the risk premium for the
private sector is difficult to manage and approximate. Also, the Federal Reserve could not determine administrative
costs from available data. Therefore, the Board believes that the Treasury rate provides a reasonable proxy for the
actual rate realized by bank holding companies on clearing balances, without the risk premium associated with holding
company investments and administrative costs incurred managing portfolio risk. Bank holding company maturity
structures and Treasury yields are publicly available so that the NICB calculation can be replicated by the private
sector. The recommended approach provides longer term investments, which would produce higher earnings, assuming
an upward sloping yield curve.

Proposed NICB Computation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An estimate of NICB is prepared annually. Under the recommended methodology, selected earning assets include Federal
funds, repurchase agreements, and securities. These investments were chosen because they most closely represent
the Treasury function investments of the private sector. The earning assets maturity structure of the BHC model would
be defined as follows: less than one year (short-term), one -to -five years (intermediate-term) and greater than
five years (long-term). The maturity structure would be calculated from the most recent four quarters of Y9 data.
The Y9 is a quarterly BHC report filed with the Federal Reserve and is generally available to the public 50 to 60 days
after the close of the quarter. For example, four quarters for 1992 would be used for the 1994 earnings rate estimate,
which would be calculated in the fall of 1993. Similarly, 1992 BHC data are used for the 1994 PSAF calculation. Historical
rates are used because the Board has decided in previous instances to avoid the appearance of forecasting interest
rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Published matching-term Treasury yields would be applied to the maturity percentages and summed to develop the earnings
rate. The Board intends initially to use shorter term Treasury rates. In this regard, a three-month Treasury yield
would be used for the short-term rate maturity portion. A one- year Treasury yield would be used for the intermediate-term,
and a five-year Treasury yield would be applied for the long-term portions. Current year-to-date (approximately
four months) week-ending average Treasury yields from the Federal Reserve H.15 Statistical Release would be used
for the estimate. The recommended maturity structure and applicable Treasury yields are shown below.

Actual NICB results are imputed monthly. Under the recommended methodology, the maturity structure developed in
the calculation of the estimate would be held constant for the year; however, current monthly Treasury yields would
be applied to the percentages to develop the weighted average earnings rate. The week-ending average yields, as published
in the Federal Reserve H.15 Statistical Release, would be used to calculate the monthly rate.

Had the recommended approach been in place for the 1994 estimate, clearing balance earnings would have increased
$55.4 million or 33.1 percent, from $167.3 million using the current method to $222.7 million. This is due to a 102 basis
points increase in the earnings rate, from 3.0877 percent in the current method to 4.1109 percent

. NICB would have increased from $25.4 million in the current method to $80.8 million.

The imputed weighted average earnings rate is derived as follows (short, intermediate, and long-term, respectively):
((32.67% * 3.0877%) + (27.58% * 3.3889%) + (39.75% * 5.4526%)) = 4.1109%

Moreover, the Board believes that investment decisions made by BHCs are not static. Instead, these decisions are
the result of several considerations, including the economic environment, their risk policies, and investment
opportunities available. Consequently, the Board recognizes that the recommended methodology may require further
adjustment based on economic situations or new investment opportunities. Prudent private sector investors would
be aware of changing variables and would make the necessary investment changes to reflect market conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Board would propose to make such adjustments, without public comment, unless the adjustment entails
a change in the methodology. Therefore, imputed investment income would be subject to the Board's approval as are
fee schedules for Federal Reserve priced services and the PSAF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the current short term nature of Federal Reserve clearing balance income is not representative of the
behavior of most correspondent banks. Although the recommended methodology still does not purely match BHC activity,
the Board believes that it more closely parallels the practices of a private sector service provider. The recommended
methodology also complies with Federal Reserve pricing principles. The Board also believes that the Treasury rate
provides a reasonable proxy for the actual rate realized by bank holding companies on clearing balances. The Treasury
rate is simpler to administer because it does not incorporate a risk premium or administrative costs of managing portfolio
risk. The Board requests comments on the proposal to: (a) change the methodology for imputing clearing balance income
to more closely parallel the practices of a private sector service provider and (b) change the rate used to impute clearing
balance income from the 90-day Treasury bill coupon equivalent yield to a longer term Treasury rate based on the earning
asset maturity structure of the largest BHCs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 4B4426) has been filed by Betz Laboratories, 4636 Somerton Rd., Trevose, PA 19053. The petition
proposes that the food additive regulations in &sect;176.170

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fatty foods
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 176.170) be amended to provide for the safe use of the copolymer of the sodium salt of acrylic acid with polyethyleneglycol
allyl ether in paper mill boilers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4 (b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
insert date 30 days after date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted,
except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets
in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence
supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The north half of the Wood River Ranch, 1,680 acres, acquired by BLM in Klamath County is closed to motorized vehicular
travel from the time of acquisition until completion of the Management Plan. The area will be open for day use only.
Day use is defined as two hours before sunrise and once half hour after sunset. Overnight camping is prohibited. No
fires of any kind are permitted. No personal property such as hunting decoys, tents, etc., can remain on the Wood River
Ranch during the overnight hours. Pit hunting blinds may not be dug on the property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These restrictions are necessary to prevent resource damage to soil, roads, vegetation, including spread of noxious
weeds and possible damage to cultural resources. Limitations are also necessary to reduce the development of trails/roads
due to unregulated cross country travel. Vehicles used for administrative, emergency, and law enforcement will
be exempt from the motor vehicle restrictions. Adjacent landowners, their agents and employees, with a right-of-way
for access, may use vehicles on the dike roads only to gain access to adjacent private property, may not take vehicles
off of the dike roads, and while on the Wood River Ranch, may not off-load personnel, personal property or equipment.
Motorized boats are not considered motorized vehicles but their use is restricted to the permanently flooded marsh.

Indiana Subdivision from its connection with the Ridge Subdivision at Ridge Branch Junction (milepost 26.6)
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 near Creekside to a connection to be established at a point to be mutually agreed upon between milepost 41.5 and milepost

In Finance Docket No. 32544 (Sub-No. 2), Conrail will grant back to CSX trackage rights over the Indiana and Ridge Subdivisions
that are being acquired and leased, for a coextensive period of time. The trackage rights on the Indiana Subdivision
are overhead. The trackage rights on the Ridge Subdivision are both overhead and local, but the local trackage rights
are restricted to limestone, limestone substitutes, ammonia, transformers and coal terminating at the Keystone
electric generating plant. The limestone and coal transportation will be further restricted to commodities originating
at quarries or mines served by CSX or short line railroads connecting solely with CSX, or originating or transloading
on The Three Rivers Railway, B&amp;PR, Allegheny Railroad, Beech Mountain Railroad, West Virginia Northern Railroad,
Elk River Railroad, or Strouds Creek &amp; Muddlety Railroad. No traffic originating on lines owned or leased by Conrail
may be transported by CSX in local service under these trackage rights. The overhead trackage rights are restricted
to movements to the portion of the Ridge Subdivision between Shelocta and Clarksburg and will terminate if CSX abandons
that portion of track. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although these trackage rights are sought under agreements with the track owner, and therefore, fall within the class
exemption procedures of 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7), Conrail and CSX seek their approval as related transactions because
the trackage rights and the other acquisitions are part of one integral transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conrail will reach Cloe via trackage rights to be obtained for this purpose. Simultaneously with the filing of this
application, Conrail filed for trackage rights over a line owned by Pittsburg &amp; Shawmut Railroad from the connection
with Conrail at Freeport to a connection with B&amp;PR at West Mosgrove
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 and trackage rights over B&amp;PR from West Mosgrove to Cloe.

CSX is a class I rail carrier operating a rail system comprising over 19,000 miles of track in 19 States, the District
of Columbia, and the Province of Ontario, Canada. CSX is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX Corporation, a noncarrier
holding company that owns and controls several carriers subject to Commission regulation, including: CSX; American
Commercial Barge Line Company (an inland barge carrier); CSX Intermodal, Inc. (a motor carrier); and various other
wholly owned carrier affiliates. The proposed purchase, lease, and trackage rights involve only CSX's rail operations
in Pennsylvania. The carrier operations of CSX's other Commission regulated affiliates are not affected by the proposed

Applicants state that all rail service over the Indiana and Ridge Subdivisions has been previously discontinued.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The Ridge Subdivision provides rail access to the Keystone electric generating plant located at milepost 5.83 near
Shelocta. The plant has never received regular shipments of coal by rail. Prior to the discontinuance of service the
plant occasionally used rail service for shipments of miscellaneous materials, heavy generating equipment for
repair or replacement, and some test shipments of coal. The plant burns approximately 4.5 million tons of coal annually.
It is primarily supplied by coal mined at or near the facility and delivered by conveyor belt or truck, but this coal
is relatively high in sulphur content. Because the plant in the future must comply with the emission standards of the
amended Clean Air Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it must obtain either lower sulphur coal, limestone for scrubbing, or both. Rail is the preferred mode to deliver
these commodities to the Keystone plant, as these commodities are not available in quantity from local sources.

 The lines also provide access to an electric generating plant at Homer City. This plant also burns locally-mined coal

Conrail serves origins that produce both lower sulphur content coal and limestone. This transaction will give the
Keystone plant the option of receiving coal or limestone in single-line service from Conrail. Because Conrail is
granting back to CSX trackage rights over the line segments being acquired and leased, CSX will also be able to provide
single-line delivery of coal, limestone, and other products to the Keystone plant. Therefore, Keystone will acquire
competitive single-line rail service, an advantage that did not previously exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conrail expects coal to begin moving to Keystone as soon as service to the plant is authorized. It estimates that approximately
150,000 tons a year will move for the first 3 years of service. It does not expect to move limestone until after the year
2000, when a scrubber is installed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conrail states that the proposed transaction involves only about 31 miles of track and one potentially major rail
shipper. Assertedly, the transaction will have no significant impact on other carriers. No interchange points are
located on the lines, and no additional through routes will be created. Nor do the lines contain any connections that
could be used for overhead traffic or to construct new through routes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants contend that the transaction will have no adverse impact on their employees because no rail service is
presently conducted on the line. They do not object to the imposition of conditions for the protection of employees

Under 49 CFR 1180.4(b)(2)(iv), we must determine whether a proposed transaction is major, significant, minor or
exempt. The proposal here does not involve the control or merger of two or more class I railroads and has no regional
or national significance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The transaction involves Conrail's purchase, lease, and acquisition of trackage rights and Conrail's grant back
of trackage rights on the lines now owned by CSX in Pennsylvania. Because service on these lines has been discontinued,
there is no actual, current competition to be lessened. Indeed, were it not for this transaction these lines apparently
would be candidates for abandonment. While CSX's grant back of trackage rights is restricted as to certain types of
traffic, the restrictions introduce the potential for market and geographic competition, if not direct head-to-head
competition, a potential that would not otherwise exist for the Keystone electric generating plant. Because the
proposed transaction would restore rail service, and the potential for rail competition, it clearly represents
a benefit to the public. Accordingly, we find the proposal a minor transaction as defined in 49 CFR 1180.2(c). See RR.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement; United States of America vs. Microsoft Corporation</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(b)&hyph;(h),
that a proposed Final Judgment, Stipulation, and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
vs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Microsoft Corporation,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Civ. No. 94&hyph;1564 (SS). The proposed Final Judgment is subject to approval by the Court after the expiration of
the statutory 60-day public comment period and compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.
&sect;16(b)&hyph;(h).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint alleges that Microsoft uses exclusionary and anticompetitive contracts to market certain of its personal
computer operating system software products. By these contracts Microsoft has unlawfully maintained its monopoly
of personal computer operating systems and has unreasonably restrained trade thereby violating Sections 1 and 2
of the Sherman Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1, 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Final Judgment not only bans Microsoft's unlawful practices, but also contains additional provisions
which are prophylactic in nature, and are intended to ensure that the anticompetitive effects of those practices
are not replicated through use by Microsoft of other exclusionary practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Final Judgment includes four categories of limitations on Microsoft's contracting practices. First,
it limits the duration of license agreements for operating system software between Microsoft and personal computer
manufacturers. Microsoft is prohibited from entering into any such license with a term exceeding one year, except
that a license may include a term permitting the computer manufacturer to renew the agreement for up to one additional
year on the same terms and conditions as those applicable in the original license period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the proposed Final Judgment restricts the manner in which Microsoft may charge royalties for the distribution
of its operating system software with personal computers. Microsoft may not enter into any ``per processor'' license
(i.e., license requiring the computer manufacturer to pay a royalty for each computer shipped with a specified microprocessor).
Microsoft's revenue from a license may not be calculated on anything other than a per copy basis (i.e., royalty for
each unit of Microsoft operating system software licensed, sold or distributed) or a per system basis (i.e., a royalty
for each computer system bearing a particular model name or number). Should Microsoft enter into a per system agreement
with a licensee it must provide a statement, the text of which is set forth in the Final Judgment, advising the licensee
of its rights under the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the proposed Final Judgment bans Microsoft from entering into license agreements that prohibit or restrict
a personal computer manufacturer from licensing, selling, or distributing competing operating system products.
Microsoft may neither condition the licensing of its operating systems on the licensing or use of other products,
nor may it enter into any license containing a minimum commitment, nor may it use lump sum pricing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, the proposed Final Judgment places limits on Microsoft's use of non-disclosure agreements for its operating
system products. Microsoft is prohibited from entering into any non-disclosure agreement whose duration extends
beyond (a) the commercial release of the covered product, (b) any prior public disclosure of information covered
by the agreement authorized by Microsoft, or (c) one year from the date of disclosure of information covered by the
agreement to a person subject to the non-disclosure agreement, whichever comes first. Also, non-disclosure agreements
may not restrict persons subject to the agreement from developing software products that will run on competing operating
systems, provided that such development does not entail the disclosure or use of Microsoft proprietary information
during the term of the agreement. Nor may any non-disclosure agreement restrict the activities of persons subject
to the agreement to whom no information covered by the agreement has been disclosed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Computer manufacturers that currently have licenses that are inconsistent with any provision of the Final Judgment
may, without penalty, terminate the license or negotiate with Microsoft to amend the inconsistent provisions. Otherwise,
Microsoft may enforce the license, subject to the following restrictions: (a) if the license is a per processor license,
it must be treated as a per system license; and (b) Microsoft may not enforce prospectively any minimum commitment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In The United States District Court For The District of Columbia, United States of America, Plaintiff, v. Microsoft
Corporation, Defendant. Civil Action No. 94&hyph;1564, Judge Charles R. Richey
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
July 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Complaint
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(For Violations of Sections 1 &amp; 2 of the Sherman Act)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States of America, acting under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States, brings this
civil action to prevent and restrain the defendant Microsoft Corporation (``Microsoft'') from using exclusionary
and anticompetitive contracts to market its personal computer operating system software. By these contracts, Microsoft
has unlawfully maintained its monopoly of personal computer (``PC'') operating systems and has unreasonably restrained
trade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virtually all major PC manufacturers find it necessary to offer Microsoft operating systems on most of their PCs.
Microsoft's monopoly power allows it to induce these manufacturers to enter into anticompetitive, long-term licenses
under which they must pay royalties to Microsoft 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
when they sell PCs containing Microsoft's operating systems, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
but also 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
when they sell PCs containing non-Microsoft operating systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These anticompetitive contracts help Microsoft maintain its dominance in the PC operating system market. By inhibiting
competing operating systems' access to PC manufacturers, Microsoft's exclusionary contracts slow innovation
and deprive consumers of an effective choice among competing PC operating systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These contracts outlined below constitute illegal monopolization and unlawful restraints of trade, and the United
States seeks this Court's order declaring Microsoft's anticompetitive contracts illegal and otherwise remedying
the unlawful effects of Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Jurisdiction, Venue and Commerce
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Section 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;4, and 28 U.S.C.
&sect;&sect;1331, 1337.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Venue is proper in this district under Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;22, and under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1391
because defendant Microsoft transacts business and is found within this district.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Microsoft sells and licenses operating systems for PCs throughout the United States and the world. Microsoft delivers
copies of its operating systems to PC manufacturers and retail customers across state lines and international borders.
Thus, Microsoft is engaged in, and its activities substantially affect, interstate and foreign commerce. The major
developers of other PC operating systems are exclusively U.S. companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Defendant Microsoft and Its Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Microsoft is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Washington, with its principal
place of business located at One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Microsoft develops, licenses, sells and supports several types of software products for PCs, including ``operating
systems'' and ``applications.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. PC operating systems control the operation of a computer by managing the interaction between the computer's microprocessor,
memory and attached devices such as keyboards, display screens, disk drives, and printers. A PC operating system
functions as the ``central nervous system'' of the PC. PC operating system software is designed to work with specific
microprocessors, the integrated circuits that function as the ``brain'' of the computer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Most of the personal computers in the world today use the x86 class of microprocessors, originally designed by Intel
Corporation. The x86 class includes Intel 286, 386, 486, and Pentium microprocessors, as well as microprocessors
manufactured by other companies that use a substantially similar architecture and instruction set. Unless otherwise
specified, the term ``PC'' refers to personal computers that use the x86 class of microprocessors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In 1980, Microsoft licensed from another company a PC operating system which it modified and introduced in 1981
as the Microsoft Disk Operating System (``MS&hyph;DOS''). According to Microsoft's 1993 Annual Report, as of June
30, 1993, approximately 120 million PCs in the world utilized MS&hyph;DOS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. In 1985, Microsoft introduced a more sophisticated PC operating system product it calls ``Windows.'' Windows
has a ``graphical user interface'' which allows users to give instructions by pointing and clicking on their computer
screen with a ``mouse'' or other similar device. Windows also allows users to run more than one application at a time.
All versions of Windows released to date require the presence of an underlying operating system, either MS&hyph;DOS
or a close substitute. Microsoft estimates that over 50 million PCs now use Windows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applications are software programs that work ``on top of'' PC operating systems to enable users to perform a broad
range of functions. Applications communicate through the PC operating system with the computer's hardware. Commonly
used applications include word processors and spreadsheets, such as WordPerfect, Lotus 1&hyph;2&hyph;3, and Quattro
Pro among others. At least 50,000 applications now run on MS&hyph;DOS and over 5,000 have been written to run on Windows.
Microsoft sells a variety of its own very successful and profitable applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Microsoft markets its PC operating system primarily through original equipment manufacturers (``OEMs''),
which manufacture PCs. It also markets through independent, non-exclusive distributors. Microsoft has agreements
with virtually all of the major microcomputer OEMs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Microsoft generally distributes MS&hyph;DOS 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to OEMs. To retail customers, Microsoft generally offers only upgrades for MS&hyph;DOS. In the first half of 1994,
the share of Windows units sold by Microsoft through the OEM channel was approximately 80%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Relevant Market and Microsoft's Monopoly Power
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. The relevant product market is personal computer operating systems for the x86 class of microprocessors (hereinafter
the ``PC operating system market''). Because operating systems written for other microprocessors will not work
on machines with an x86 class microprocessor, OEMs who sell x86 machines and customers who buy such machines cannot
use other operating systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The relevant geographic market is the world.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Microsoft has monopoly power in the relevant market and has had monopoly power since at least the mid-1980s. For
almost a decade Microsoft has retained an extremely high market share_consistently in excess of 70%.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16. Substantial barriers to entry and expansion exist in the relevant market. One barrier to entry and expansion is
the considerable time and expense required to develop, test, and market a new PC operating system. Other interrelated
barriers to entry and expansion include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. the absence of a variety of high quality applications that run on a new operating system, and the difficulty of convincing
independent software vendors (``ISVs'') to develop such applications;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. the lack of a sizable installed base of users; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. the difficulty in convincing OEMs to offer and promote a non-Microsoft PC operating system, particularly one with
a small installed base and relatively few applications designed to run on it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. These barriers magnify and reinforce each other because the value of an operating system to a consumer is directly
related to two factors: the availability of a variety of high quality applications that run on that system, and the
number of users who use that operating system and thus are able to share information and work with the system without
additional training. ISVs, in turn, tend to develop applications for operating systems with a large installed base
of users, and consumers gravitate towards operating systems with a large base of applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Microsoft's anticompetitive contracting practices described below significantly increase the already high
barriers to entry and expansion facing competitors in the PC operating system market. These practices reduce the
likelihood that OEMs will license and promote non-Microsoft PC operating systems, make it more difficult for Microsoft's
competitors to persuade ISVs to develop applications for their operating systems, and impede the ability of a non-Microsoft
PC operating system to expand its installed base of users.

Microsoft's Exclusionary and Anticompetitive OEM Licenses Foreclose Access to the OEM Channel by Microsoft's PC
Operating System Competitors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
19. In 1980, IBM agreed to license the original version of MS&hyph;DOS from Microsoft for IBM's PC, which experienced
considerable success. Other OEMs also used MS&hyph;DOS in order better to emulate the IBM PC. Microsoft quickly dominated
and gained a monopoly in the market for PC operating systems. It then entered into a series of exclusionary and anticompetitive
contract terms to maintain its monopoly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Because of Microsoft's monopoly position in the marketplace, OEMs believe that they must offer MS&hyph;DOS and
Windows to their customers. Profit margins in the computer hardware industry are very thin and OEMs want to obtain
MS&hyph;DOS and Windows at the lowest possible cost. Microsoft has induced many OEMs to execute anticompetitive
``per processor'' contracts for MS&hyph;DOS and Windows, even though many would prefer to preserve their freedom
to offer PCs with non-Microsoft operating systems.

Microsoft's Licenses Impose a Penalty or Tax Paid to Microsoft on OEMs' Use of Non-Microsoft PC Operating Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21. Microsoft's licenses impose a penalty or ``tax'' paid to Microsoft upon OEMs' use of competing PC operating systems.
``Per processor'' licenses require OEMs to pay a royalty for each computer the OEM sells containing a particular processor
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, an Intel 386 microprocessor) whether or not the OEM has included a Microsoft operating system with that computer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. Microsoft's per processor contracts penalize OEMs, during the life of the contract, for installing a non-Microsoft
operating system. OEMs that have signed per processor contracts with Microsoft are deterred from using competitive
alternatives to Microsoft operating systems.

The Contract Length of Microsoft's Anticompetitive Per Processor Contracts Magnifies Its Exclusionary Effects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
23. Microsoft further impedes PC operating system competitors by executing long-term contracts with major OEMs,
and by requiring minimum commitments and crediting unused balances to future contracts, which effectively extends
the contract term and makes it economically unattractive for an OEM to install a non-Microsoft operating system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. Microsoft's exclusionary licenses are often for a duration of three years or more_a period of time equal to, or
exceeding, the product life cycle of most PC operating system products. Microsoft often extends the term of its OEM
licenses through amendment. Thus, Microsoft's anticompetitive per processor contracts can extend to beyond five
years.

Microsoft's Exclusionary Contracts Foreclose Other PC Operating System Vendors From a Substantial and Critically
Important Segment of the Market
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
25. Access to the OEM channel is critical to the success of a competing operating system. The overwhelming majority
of PCs are sold with a pre-installed operating system. Thus, to reach the ultimate consumer of an operating system,
it is important that competitors have access to OEMs. Operating system vendors, as well as OEMs, confirm that successful
entry is extremely difficult in the absence of ``proper support'' in the OEM channel in the form of public commitments
to sell a new operating system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. Since 1988, Microsoft has induced major OEMs to execute per processor contracts, many of which extend for several
years. These OEMs are critical to the success of a new operating system entrant; it would be virtually impossible for
a new entrant to achieve commercial success solely through license agreements with small OEMs that are not covered
by Microsoft's per processor agreements. According to Microsoft, in fiscal year 1993, per processor agreements
accounted for an estimated 60% of Microsoft's MS&hyph;DOS sales to OEMs and 43% of Window sales to OEMs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. Competing operating system developers, finding the largest OEMs contractually bound by Microsoft's exclusionary
licenses, are disadvantaged in their efforts to bring to the consumer less expensive and/or better quality operating
system products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. The effect of Microsoft's licensing practices has been to exclude competitors by unreasonable and anticompetitive
means and to lessen competition in the relevant market. Microsoft's practices deter OEMs from entering into licensing
agreements with competing operating system providers, discourage OEMs who agree to sell non-Microsoft operating
systems from promoting those products, and raise the price of computers sold with competing operating systems, thereby
depressing the demand and restricting the output of these products. Microsoft's licensing practices have effectively
foreclosed a substantial share of the relevant market; they are exclusionary, anticompetitive, and not justified
by legitimate business considerations.

Microsoft's Anticompetitive Non-Disclosure Agreements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
29. ISVs develop applications, which motivate consumers to purchase PCs. Microsoft has sought to have several commercially
important ISVs and their employees agree to non-disclosure agreements that would restrict their ability to work
with competing PC operating systems as well as restrict their ability to develop competitive products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. Microsoft moved to impose these restrictions in connection with its ``beta tests'' of its new operating system,
the next version of Windows, code-named Chicago. Microsoft anticipates commercially releasing Chicago in late
1994 or early 1995. Beta tests of new versions of an operating system, which are conducted prior to the commercial release
of that new version, help both Microsoft and the ISVs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. For the ISVs, the beta tests provide, among other things, critical information about the interfaces in the operating
system that connect with applications_information which the ISVs need to write applications that run on the operating
system. Early access to the beta tests is especially valuable to the ISVs if they are to be able to release their applications
within a short time after the commercial release of a new Microsoft operating system, such as Chicago.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32. For Microsoft, the beta tests enable ISVs, informed experts, and selected members of the media to provide important
feedback about the advantages ad drawbacks of the operating system. In addition, the demand for Microsoft's operating
systems depends to a significant extent on the availability of applications designed to work with it. Accordingly,
it is in Microsoft's interest to provide ISVs early access to beta tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33. At the same time, because Microsoft necessarily must disclose certain confidential information during the course
of the beta tests, it has legitimate interests in maintaining that confidentiality. In the past, Microsoft has protected
its interests through non-disclosure agreements that prohibit those participating in the beta tests from disclosing
such confidential information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. In connection with its beta tests of Chicago, however, Microsoft sought to impose on certain leading software
companies far more restrictive non-disclosure agreements than it had previously used. The terms of these non-disclosure
agreements would preclude developers at these companies from working with operating system companies, other competitors
of Microsoft, and competing technologies for an unreasonably long period of time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Anticompetitive Effects of Microsoft's Conduct
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
35. Microsoft's exclusionary contracting practices have had the effect of excluding competitors on a basis other
than competition on the merits and have thereby allowed Microsoft illegally to perpetuate its monopoly in the PC operating
system market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. Through the unlawful acts and practices described above Microsoft has harmed competition, consumers and innovation:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Microsoft has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the PC operating system market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Microsoft's exclusionary conduct has significantly impeded the ability of rival operating systems to compete
in the PC operating system market. Competitors find it more difficult to convince OEMs to offer and/or promote their
product and must incur greater marketing expenses to penetrate the market. Microsoft raised hurdles to fair competition
even higher through unreasonably restrictive non-disclosure agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Microsoft's exclusionary licenses deprive rival PC operating systems of a significant number of sales that they
might otherwise secure. These lost sales impede the ability of PC operating systems to develop an installed base sufficient
to convince OEMs to bundle the new system with their hardware, to convince ISVs to write applications that run on the
new system, and to convince users that the system is, and will remain, a viable alternative to the existing MS&hyph;DOS
and Windows standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Microsoft's conduct also substantially lengthens the period of time required for competitors to recover their
development costs and earn a profit, and increases the risk that an entry attempt will fail. In combination, all of
these factors deter entry by competitors and thus harm competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. The harm to competition caused by Microsoft's unlawful conduct harms consumers. OEMs that do offer customers
a choice of operating systems may charge customers a higher price for PCs with non-Microsoft operating systems in
order to be able to pay the double royalty necessitated by the Microsoft per processor agreements. Thus, users who
do not receive a Microsoft operating system are still, indirectly, paying Microsoft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. In addition, Microsoft's unlawful conduct has deterred the development of competing operating systems, depriving
consumers of a choice of systems with possibly superior features. Similarly, the slower growth of competing operating
systems has slowed the development and diffusion of applications designed to work on non-Microsoft operating systems
and has limited choices of consumers and users of PCs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39. Those injured by Microsoft's conduct will continue to suffer such injury unless the relief prayed for herein is
granted.

Wherefore, Plaintiff Prays For Relief As Follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. That the Court adjudge and decree that Microsoft has monopolized the interstate trade and commerce in the market
for PC operating systems in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. That the Court adjudge and decree that Microsoft has entered into unlawful contracts and combinations which unreasonably
restrain the trade in interstate commerce in PC operating systems, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

3. That Microsoft and all persons, firms and corporations acting on its behalf and under its direction or control be
permanently enjoined from engaging in, carrying out, renewing or attempting to engage, carry out or renew, any contracts,
agreements, practices, or understandings in violation of the Sherman Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. That plaintiff have such other relief that the Court may consider necessary or appropriate to restore competitive
conditions in the markets affected by Microsoft's unlawful conduct.

Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 15, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust Complaint to prevent and restrain Microsoft Corporation
(``Microsoft'') from using exclusionary and anticompetitive contracts to market its personal computer operating
system software, in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1, 2. As alleged in the Complaint, Microsoft
has used these contracts to restrain trade and to monopolize the market for operating systems for personal computers
using the x86 class of microprocessors, which comprise most of the world's personal computers. As used herein, ``PC''
refers to personal computers that use this class of microprocessor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint alleges that Microsoft has used its monopoly power to induce PC manufacturers to enter into anticompetitive,
long-term licenses under which they must pay Microsoft not only when they sell PCs containing Microsoft's operating
systems, but also when they sell PCs containing non-Microsoft operating systems. These anticompetitive, long-term
licenses have helped Microsoft to maintain its monopoly. By inhibiting competing operating systems' access to PC
manufacturers, Microsoft's exclusionary licenses slow innovation, raise prices, and deprive consumers of an effective
choice among competing PC operating systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint also alleges that in connection with pre-release testing of a new Microsoft operating system code-named
``Chicago,'' Microsoft sought to impose unreasonably restrictive and anticompetitive non-disclosure agreements
on a number of leading developers of applications software products. These non-disclosure agreements would have
unreasonably restricted the ability of software developers to work with competing operating systems or to develop
competitive products or technologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint seeks to prevent Microsoft from continuing or renewing any of the anticompetitive practices alleged
to violate the Sherman Act, and thus to provide fair opportunities for other firms to compete in the market for PC operating
systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States and Microsoft have agreed that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with
the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Entry of the Final Judgment will terminate this civil action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction for further
proceedings that may be required to interpret, enforce, or modify the Judgment, or to punish violations of any of its
provisions.

If this case were to proceed to trial, the United State would prove the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Microsoft develops, licenses, sells, and supports several types of software products for personal computers, including
operating systems and applications. An operating system is software that controls the basic operations of the personal
computer. Applications software, such as word processing programs and spread sheets, runs ``on top of'' an operating
system to enable the computer to perform a broad range of useful functions. Operating systems are designed to work
with specific microprocessors, the integrated circuits that function as the ``brain'' of the computer. Most of the
personal computers in the world today use the x86 class of microprocessors, originally designed by Intel, and now
including microprocessors manufactured by other companies that use a substantially similar architecture and instruction
set. Original equipment manufacturers (``OEMs'') that sell PCs and customers who buy such machines cannot use operating
systems written for other microprocessors.

In 1981, Microsoft introduced a PC operating system called the Microsoft Disk Operating System (``MS&hyph;DOS''),
the original version of which Microsoft licensed to IBM for use in IBM's PC. As IBM's PC experienced considerable commercial
success, other OEMs also used MS&hyph;DOS in order better to emulate the IBM PC. In 1985, Microsoft introduced ``Windows,''
a more sophisticated PC operating system product designed for use in conjunction with MS&hyph;DOS. Windows allowed
users to give instructions with a ``mouse'' or similar device and also to run more than one application at a time. Microsoft
quickly gained a monopoly in the market for PC operating systems worldwide. For almost a decade, Microsoft's market
share has consistently exceeded 70%.

In 1993, Microsoft's MS&hyph;DOS operating system constituted approximately 79% of the operating systems sold
to PC manufacturers. PC&hyph;DOS accounted for approximately 13% of such sales, OS/2 constituted approximately
4%, DR&hyph;DOS constituted approximately 3%, and Unix operating systems constituted approximately 1%. A chart
showing these market shares is attached as Exh. 1.

Development, testing, and marketing of a new PC operating system involves considerable time and expense. A new operating
system faces additional barriers to entry, including the absence of a variety of high quality applications to run
on the system; the small number of people trained on and using the system, which discourages customers from buying
it and software companies from writing applications to run on it; and, since the overwhelming majority of PCs are sold
with a pre-installed operating system, the difficulty of convincing OEMs to offer and promote the system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Microsoft has used exclusionary and anticompetitive contract terms to maintain its monopoly. OEMs believe that
a substantial portion of their customers will want a PC with MS&hyph;DOS and Windows, and therefore feel that they
must be able to offer their customers MS&hyph;DOS and Windows. With thin profit margins, OEMs want to obtain these
products at the lowest possible cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning in 1988, and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anticompetitive ``per
processor'' licenses. Under a per processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing
a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft
operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty,
or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has
increased. In fiscal year 1993, per processor licenses accounted for an estimated 60% of MS&hyph;DOS sales to OEMs
and 43% of Window sales to OEMs.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Collectively, the OEMs who have such per processor contracts are critical to the success of competing operating system
vendors, but those OEMs effectively are foreclosed to Microsoft's competitors.

Per processor licenses accounted for an increasing proportion of Microsoft's operating system sales in the 1988&hyph;1993
period. Twenty per cent of all units of MS&hyph;DOS that were sold to OEMs in FY 1989 were sold pursuant to per processor
licenses. That percentage increased to 22% in FY 1990; 27% in FY 1991; 50% in FY 1992; and to 60% in FY 1993. A chart showing
this increasing use of per-processor licenses is attached as Exh. 2.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Microsoft has further foreclosed the OEM channel through the use of long-term contracts with major OEMs, some expiring
as long as five years from their original negotiation date. In some cases, these contracts have left OEMs with unused
balances on their minimum commitments, which Microsoft can allow to be used if the contract is extended, but which
would be forfeited if the OEM does not extend the contract. These practices have allowed Microsoft to extend the effective
duration of its OEM contracts, further impeding the access of PC operating system competitors to the OEM channel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to using anticompetitive OEM licenses, Microsoft has also employed anticompetitive restrictions in
certain of its non-disclosure agreements (``NDAs''). Microsoft anticipates commercially releasing Chicago,
the next version of Windows, in late 1994 or early 1995. In preparation for its release, Microsoft has allowed certain
third parties, including independent software vendors (``ISVs'') who write applications, to have access to pre-release
versions of Chicago, a process known in the software industry as ``beta testing.'' This permits Microsoft to receive
feedback from the beta testers, and the ISVs to begin writing applications for Chicago prior to its release.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with beta testing Chicago, Microsoft employed, as it has in prior beta tests, NDAs prohibiting disclosure
of confidential information. In this instance, however, Microsoft sought to impose on certain leading software
companies far more restrictive NDAs than it had previously used. These NDAs would have precluded developers from
working on competitive products and technologies for an unreasonably long period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through these practices, Microsoft has excluded competitors by unreasonable and anticompetitive means, thereby
lessening competition and maintaining a monopoly in the PC operating system market. Microsoft's licensing practices
deter OEMs from entering into licensing agreements with operating system rivals and discourage OEMs who agree to
sell non-Microsoft operating systems from promoting those systems. By depriving rivals of a significant number
of sales that they might otherwise secure, Microsoft makes it more difficult for its rivals to convince ISVs to write
applications for their systems, for OEMs to offer and promote their systems, and for users to believe that their systems
will remain viable alternatives to MS&hyph;DOS and Windows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Microsoft's exclusionary contracts harm consumers. OEMs that sign Microsoft's exclusionary licenses but offer
consumers a choice of operating systems may charge a higher price, in order to cover the double royalty, for PCs using
a non-Microsoft operating system. Even consumers who do not receive a Microsoft operating system still pay Microsoft
indirectly. Thus, Microsoft's licensing practices have raised the cost of personal computers to consumers.

Microsoft's conduct also substantially lengthens the period of time required for competitors to recover their development
costs and earn a profit, and thereby increases the risk that an entry attempt will fail. In combination, all these factors
deter entry by competitors and thus harm competition. By deterring the development of competitive operating systems,
Microsoft has deprived consumers of a choice of potentially superior products. Similarly, the slower growth of competing
operating systems has retarded the development of applications for such systems.

Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed Final Judgment will end Microsoft's unlawful practices that restrain trade and perpetuate its monopoly
power in the market for PC operating systems. In addition, the proposed Final Judgment contains provisions that are
remedial in nature and designed to assure that Microsoft will not engage in the future in exclusionary practices designed
to produce the same or similar effects as those set forth in the Complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, Sections IV (A), (C), and (F) prohibit Mirosoft's use of the specific exclusionary practices alleged
in the complaint_``per processor'' contracts, lengthy terms, and minimum commitments_that foreclose competing
PC operating system vendors from much of the OEM channel. Sections IV (K)&hyph;(L) prohibit the use of anticompetitive
non-disclosure agreements in conjunction with Mirosoft's distribution of pre-commercial releases of operating
system software products. Sections IV (B), (E), (G), and (H) impose prohibitions that go beyond the alleged exclusionary
practices in order to ensure that Microsoft's future contracting practices_not challenged here because not yet
used_do not unreasonably impede competition. Sections IV (J) and (M) are designed to bring existing contracts into
immediate compliance with the proposed Final Judgment.

Scope of the Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The injunctions in Section IV generally apply to ``covered products'' which are defined, in Section II(A), as the
binary code of MS&hyph;DOS 6.22; Microsoft Windows 3.11; Windows for Workgroups 3.11; predecessor versions of those
products; the product currently code-named ``Chicago'' (the planned successor to Microsoft Windows 3.11); and
other successor versions of or products marketed as replacements for the aforementioned products. This definition
includes all Microsoft's PC operating system products in which the defendant currently possesses a substantial
degree of market power. The definition does not encompass and specifically excludes, Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Advanced Server, neither of which has a significant share of a relevant market at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``covered product'' was drafted with the recognition that Microsoft will continue to modify its
operating system products throughout the duration of the Final Judgment. The prohibitions in the decree will apply
to the successor and replacement products of those existing operating system products that have substantial market
power. The decree will govern the licensing of such products if they are made available as stand-alone products to
OEMs pursuant to license agreements, or as unbundled products that perform operating system software functions
now embodied in the specifically listed existing products. Moreover, the decree will govern the licensing of successor
versions of or products marketed as replacements for MS&hyph;DOS 6.22, Microsoft Windows 3.11, Windows for Workgroups
3.11, and ``Chicago,'' even if such successor or replacement products could also be characterized as successors
or replacements of operating system software products that are not covered, such as windows NT Workstation or Windows
NT Advanced Server.

Prohibition of the Licensing Violations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three anticompetitive factors of Microsoft's license agreements that are challenged in the complaint_the excessive
duration of those agreements, the requirement of royalty payments on a ``per processor'' basis, and large minimum
commitments_are addressed principally in Sections IV(A), IV(C) and (IV)(F) of the Final Judgment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duration:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section IV(A) limits the duration of Microsoft's license agreements with OEMs to one year, with OEMs having the option
to renew a license for one additional one year term on the same terms and conditions as in the first year. This limitation
on the duration of license agreements, along with the safeguards provided in Section IV(G), will ensure that vendors
of competing operating systems will have regular and frequent opportunities to attempt to market their products
to OEMs. Absent such opportunities, Microsoft's competitors might be unable to reach the level of market penetration
needed for profitable operation in a reasonable period of time, even if they are offering products that are deemed
superior by those customers who have an opportunity to buy them.

Per Processor Licenses:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section IV(C) prohibits the use of per processor licenses.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Section II(K) defines per processor licenses as licenses that require the OEM to pay a royalty for all personal computer
systems that contain specified microprocessors. As noted above, the requirement to pay a royalty to Microsoft on
the sale of a PC that has a non-Microsoft operating system is comparable, in its economic effect, to the imposition
of a ``tax'' on the competing operating system. Per processor licenses are also very similar to exclusive dealing
or requirements contracts; the OEM in effect is obtaining the right to use Microsoft's operating system, and is paying
an operating system royalty, for all of its operating system ``requirements'' for use on PCs using the designated
microprocessors.

Minimum Commitments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section IV(F) will bar Microsoft from entering into any license agreement containing a minimum commitment.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 While minimum commitments are not in and of themselves illegal, they can be used to achieve a similar effect as that
accomplished through per processor licenses or exclusive dealing contracts. If the minimum commitment is greater
than the number of units of Microsoft software that the OEM expects or would otherwise desire to use at any time during
the term of the contract, the minimum commitment creates a disincentive for an OEM to make incremental purchases of
non-Microsoft operating systems. In that context, the minimum commitment also operates in effect to require a royalty
payment to Microsoft, even for PCs that use a non-Microsoft operating system. This effect will be ended by Section
(IV)(F).

Microsoft Prohibited From Limiting OEM Sales of Competing Operating System Products: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section IV (B) bars Microsoft from entering into license agreements that prohibit or restrict an OEM from licensing,
selling, or distributing competing operating system products. In addition, Section IV (E) prohibits Microsoft
from expressly or impliedly conditioning its licenses of operating systems on the licensing, purchase, use or distribution
not only of other covered products, but also any other Microsoft product, or non-Microsoft product. Without these
provisions Microsoft could force OEMs to purchase covered products and thus accomplish anticompetitive effects
similar to those achieved through its unlawful licensing practices, or attempt to extend or protect its monopoly
in any covered product by conditioning its licensing, purchase or use of other products.

Microsoft Limited to Per Copy and Per System Licenses: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections IV (D) and IV (G) require Microsoft to use either ``per copy'' or ``per system'' licenses. Per copy licenses,
if used in conjunction with pro-competitive volume discounts, pose few competitive concerns. Per system licenses,
if not carefully fenced in, could be used by Microsoft to accomplish anticompetitive ends similar to ``per processor''
licenses. However, if an OEM easily can designate models not subject to a per system license, it can use non-Microsoft
operating systems on those models without incurring a royalty obligation to Microsoft. If an OEM need not pay a royalty
to Microsoft for anything but the number of copies of the Microsoft operating system that it actually uses, that OEM
will not be deterred from licensing, purchasing or using competing operating system products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Restriction on Per System Licenses: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Final Judgment also places restrictions on the use of per system licenses to ensure that they are not used in an exclusionary
manner. In particular, Section IV (G) specifies that per system licenses must allow the licensee to create ``new systems''
that can be sold without incurring a royalty obligation to Microsoft if they do not utilize a Microsoft product. Under
Section IV (G), an OEM need only designate a new model name or number to create a ``new system.'' Microsoft may not require
the OEM even to notify Microsoft of the creation of a new system; nor may Microsoft impose requirements relating to
the marketing or advertising of a new system, or penalize an OEM for creating a new system. Section IV (G)(4) requires
Microsoft to notify within 30 days following entry of this Final Judgment all existing OEM licensees under per system
licenses and all OEM licensees with per processor licenses who choose to let them to be converted to per system licenses
(a provision discussed below) of their rights to create new systems that will not be subject to any existing per system
license. This notice provision ensures that existing licensees promptly know of their rights to avoid royalty payments
under per system contracts if they choose to create new systems.

Microsoft Prohibited From Using Lump Sum Pricing: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section IV (H) also serves a prophylactic function, prohibiting the use of lump sum pricing in license agreements
for covered products. As defined in Section II (F), lump sum pricing is any royalty payment that does not vary with the
number of copies of the covered product (under per copy licenses) or the number of personal computer systems (under
per system licenses) that are licensed, sold, or distributed by the OEM. This restriction, like the prohibitions
on minimum commitments and requirements contracts, restricts conduct that could be used by Microsoft to achieve
effects comparable to the effects of the conduct challenged by the government, and for that reason is enjoined.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
If a license agreement established a minimum commitment greater than the OEM's requirements for operating systems
(an agreement that would be prohibited under this decree), the minimum commitment would constitute, in effect, a
lump sum payment. Regardless of the number of copies distributed by the OEM, its royalty payment to Microsoft would
not vary. A lump sum pricing arrangement imposed by a monopolist that allowed unlimited use of the licensed product
for a single fee calibrated to the anticipated total operating system needs of a particular OEM would also produce
a similar economic effect as a requirements contract or a per processor license: the OEM would owe the same royalty
to Microsoft whether it chose to use a Microsoft operating system on all of the PCs it sold, or only on some of the PCs it
sold, and would, in effect, ``pay twice'' if it chose to purchase a non-Microsoft operating system for some of its PCs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neither Section IV (H) nor any other provision of the proposed Final Judgment prohibits the use of royalty rates, including
rates embodying volume discounts, agreed upon in advance with respect to each individual OEM, each specific version
or language of a covered products, and each designated personal computer system model. Nothing in the Final Judgment,
however, in any way sanctions Microsoft structuring any volume discount whose purpose or effect is to impose de facto
requirements contracts or exclusive arrangements on the OEM. As discussed below in connection with alternatives
to the proposed Final Judgment, given Microsoft's monopoly power in operating systems, such practices can violate
the antitrust laws.

Transition Rules

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Stipulation consenting to the entry of the proposed Final Judgment, Microsoft agreed to abide by the provisions
of the proposed Final Judgment immediately upon the filing of the Complaint, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as of July 15, 1994. Among other things, the transition provisions described herein will require Microsoft to abide
by the foregoing limitations and prohibitions when entering into any license agreements with OEMs after July 15,
1994. Certain additional provisions of the proposed Final Judgment also apply to existing license agreements that
are inconsistent with the proposed Final Judgment's requirements for new license agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Section IV (I), existing OEM licensees may terminate or negotiate with Microsoft to amend their agreements
to make them consistent with the requirements of the Final Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV (J) provides that if an OEM chooses not to exercise either of these options, Microsoft must abide by the following
rules. First, under Section IV (J)(1), a per processor license must be treated as a ``per system'' license' OEM models
that contain the microprocessor(s) specified in such a per processor license will be considered to be covered by the
``per system'' license unless the OEM opts in writing to exclude such model from coverage. As already noted, OEMs may
freely sell PCs with non-Microsoft operating systems, and avoid any obligation to pay royalties to Microsoft under
a per system license, simply by designating such PCs as a new system with a separate model number or name. Second, under
Section IV (J)(2), Microsoft may not enforce any minimum commitment in an existing license agreement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These provisions further two consistent goals. Opportunities for competition in the PC operating system market
are fostered by a rapid end to the unlawful practices embodied in existing licenses. At the same time, the transition
rules avoid creating hardships for OEMs by not unnecessarily disrupting established commercial relationships
with Microsoft. Indeed, OEMs are not required to terminate or amend their existing contracts with Microsoft; the
choice to do so is theirs alone. Microsoft, however, may not enforce the per processor or minimum commitment features
of any existing contract. Providing OEMs with this choice minimizes the costs of the transition from existing license
agreements that are inconsistent with the decree to new license agreements, while ensuring that any unavoidable
transition costs be borne largely by Microsoft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that existing licensees learn of their rights under the proposed Final Judgment, Section IV (M) requires
Microsoft to provide a copy of the Final Judgment to all OEMs with which it has license agreements, except for those
who have licenses only under Microsoft's Small Volume Easy Distribution program or the Delivery Service Partner
program.

Non-Disclosure Agreements

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the proposed Final Judgment contains provisions that prevent Microsoft from imposing unlawfully restrictive
NDAs on developers of applications software.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections IV(K)(l) limits the duration of any NDA to the earliest of (a) the commercial release of the product covered
by the NDA, (b) an earlier public disclosure of the information covered by the NDA, or (c) one year after the information
is disclosed to the person subject to the NDA. Section IV(K)(2) provides that NDAs may not restrict subject parties
from developing software products that will run on competing operating systems, if such development does not entail
the use or disclosure of Microsoft proprietary information during the term of the NDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In combination, these provisions recognize that whatever Microsoft's legitimate interest in protecting the confidentiality
of proprietary information covered by the NDAs, the need for any such protection must be balanced against the competitive
consequences of any restriction imposed on others concerning disclosure and use of the information. The proposed
Final Judgment ensures that any NDA imposed by Microsoft will not extend beyond the point that the information has
been released to the public or has otherwise been in the hands of parties for more than one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV(L) requires that the form of all standard NDAs must be approved by a Microsoft corporate officer, and that
non-standard language in an NDA relating to matters covered in Section (K) must be approved by a Microsoft senior attorney.
These provisions are designed to ensure that NDAs will be reviewed by company officials mindful of the requirements
of the Final Judgment.

Section V of the proposed Final Judgment establishes standards and procedures by which the Department of Justice

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, Section V(D) contains provisions under which the Department can obtain information and documents
relating to any Undertaking by or Decision against Microsoft arising from parallel antitrust proceedings of the
Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission (``DG&hyph;IV''). This provision will allow the
Department to coordinate its monitoring and enforcement of compliance of the Final Judgment with DG&hyph;IV's monitoring
and enforcement of parallel provisions contained in an Undertaking with DG&hyph;IV signed by Microsoft on July 15,
1994.

In making this public interest determination, ``[t]he balancing of competing social and political interests affected
by a proposed antitrust consent decree must be left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General.
The court's role in protecting the public interest is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty
to the public in consenting to the decree. The court is required to determine not whether a particular decree is the
one that will best serve society, but whether the settlement is `within the reaches of the public interest.''' United

Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the remedies provided in the proposed Final Judgment, the Department also considered whether to require
limitations on the manner in which Microsoft could structure volume discount pricing arrangements for covered products.
While the Department recognizes that volume discount pricing can be and normally is pro-competitive, volume discounts
also can be structured by a seller with monopoly power (such as Microsoft) in such a way that buyers, who must purchase
some substantial quantity from the monopolist, effectively are coerced by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
structure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the discount schedule (as opposed to the level of the price) to buy all or substantially all of the supplies they need
from the monopolist. Where such a result occurs, the Department believes that the volume discount structure would
unlawfully foreclose competing suppliers from the marketplace_in this case, competing operating systems_and
thus may be challenged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department ultimately concluded that it would not require provisions in the Final Judgment to attempt to proscribe
in advance the various means by which Microsoft could attempt to structure volume discounts as a means to thwart competition
rather than as a means of promoting competition. The Department reached this conclusion because it does not have evidence
that Microsoft has, to date, in fact structured its volume discounts to achieve anticompetitive ends. The Department
did, however, communicate to Microsoft its concern and stated its intent to initiate an investigation and antitrust
enforcement proceeding, if warranted, should Microsoft adopt anticompetitive volume discount structures in its
future license agreements. Given the procompetitive impact of the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment, the
normally procompetitive nature of volume discount pricing, and the absence of any evidence that Microsoft has used
volume discounting in an anticompetitive manner to date, the Department believes that this resolution is appropriate
on the record at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative to the proposed Final Judgment would be a full trial of this case. The Department of Justice believes
that such a trial would involve substantial cost to the United States and is not warranted since the proposed Final
Judgment provides all of the relief that the United States seeks in its Complaint and includes substantial additional
prophylactic measures as well.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Microsoft may include as a term in any such License Agreement that the OEM may, at its sole discretion, at any time between
90 and 120 days prior to the expiration of the original License Agreement, renew such License Agreement for up to one
additional year on the same terms and conditions as those applicable in the original license period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The License Agreement shall not impose a penalty or charge of any kind on an OEM for its election not to renew all or any
portion of a License Agreement. In the event that an OEM does not exercise the option to renew a License Agreement as
provided above, and a new License Agreement is entered between Microsoft and the OEM, the arm's length negotiation
of different terms and conditions, specifically including a higher royalty rate(s), will not by itself constitute
a penalty or other charge within the meaning of the foregoing sentence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Duration of any License Agreement with an OEM not domiciled in the United States or the European Economic Area that
will not be effective prior to regulatory approval in the country of its domicile may be extended at the option of Microsoft
or the OEM during the time required for any such regulatory approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
License Agreement provisions that do not bear on the licensing or distribution of the Covered Products may survive
expiration or termination of the License Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement that by its terms prohibits or restricts the OEM's licensing,
sale or distribution of any non-Microsoft Operating System Software product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Microsoft shall not enter into any Per Processor License.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Except to the extent permitted by Section IV (G) below, Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement other
than a Per Copy License.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement in which the terms of that agreement are expressly or impliedly
conditioned upon:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the licensing of any other Covered Product, Operating System Software product or other product (provided, however,
that this provision in and of itself shall not be construed to prohibit Microsoft from developing integrated products);
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the OEM not licensing, purchasing, using or distributing any non-Microsoft product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement containing a Minimum Commitment. However, nothing contained
herein shall prohibit Microsoft and any OEM from developing non-binding estimates of projected sales of Microsoft's
Covered Products for use in calculating royalty payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) Microsoft's revenue from a License Agreement for any Covered Product shall not be derived from other than Per Copy
or Per System Licenses, as defined herein. In any Per System License:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Microsoft shall not explicitly or implicitly require as a condition of entering into any License Agreement, or
for purposes of applying any volume discount, or otherwise, that any OEM include under its Per System License more
than one of its Personal Computer Systems;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Microsoft shall not charge or collect royalties for any Covered Product on any Personal Computer System unless
the Personal Computer System is designated by the OEM in the License Agreement or in a written amendment. Microsoft
shall not require an OEM which creates a New System to notify Microsoft of the existence of such a New System, or to take
any particular actions regarding marketing or advertising of that New System, other than creation of a unique model
name or model number that the OEM shall use for internal and external identification purposes. The requirement of
external identification may be satisfied by placement of the unique model name or model number on the machine and its
container (if any), without more. The OEM and Microsoft may agree to amend the License Agreement to include any new
model of Personal Computer System in a Per System License. Nothing in this clause shall be deemed to preclude Microsoft
from seeking compensation from an OEM that makes or distributes copies of a Covered Product in breach of its License
Agreement or in violation of copyright law;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The License Agreement shall not impose a penalty or charge on account of an OEM's choosing at any time to create a
New System. Addition of a New System to the OEM's License Agreement so that Covered Products are licensed for distribution
with such New System and royalties are payable with respect thereto shall not be deemed to constitute a penalty or other
charge of any kind within the meaning of the foregoing sentence;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All OEMs with existing Per System Licenses, or Per Processor Licenses treated by Microsoft under Section IV (J)
as Per System Licenses, will be sent within 30 days following entry of this Final Judgment in a separately mailed notice
printed in bold, boxed type which shall begin with the sentence ``You are operating under a Microsoft Per System License,''
and shall continue with the language contained in the first four quoted paragraphs below. All new or amended Per System
Licenses executed after September 1, 1994 shall contain a provision that appears on the top half of the signature page
in bold, boxed type shall begin with the sentence ``This is a Microsoft Per System License,'' and which shall continue
with the language contained in the first four quoted paragraphs below.

Charles A. Buscema, M.D.; Continuance of Registration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 21, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Charles A. Buscema, M.D. (Respondent), of Albany, New York, proposing to revoke
his DEA Certificate of Registration, BB0636021, and deny any pending applications for registration on grounds that
he had been convicted of a felony related to controlled substances, was not currently licensed to handle controlled
substances in the state in which he practices, and that his continued registration would be inconsistent with the
public interest, as set forth in 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(2), (3), and (4) and 823(f). The Order to Show Cause alleged that:
(1) On January 13, 1989, before the Albany County Court of the State of New York, Respondent was convicted of one felony
count of a violation of falsifying business records in the first degree, which falsification referred to the dispensation
of controlled substances, and Respondent was sentenced to five years probation which included a provision that he
not dispense any controlled substances from his office; (2) on November 12, 1990, Respondent voluntarily surrendered
his DEA Certificate of Registration, AB7544314, for cause; (3) on May 29, 1991, the New York State Board of Health entered
a stipulation and order which found that during the period February 1983 through November 1987, Respondent dispensed
9,850 dosage units of Schedule II controlled substances without preparing a prescription, failed to make records
of dispensing 5,060 dosage units of controlled substances, and made 32 false entries regarding controlled substances
in patient records, and as a result Respondent was assessed a civil penalty and his ability to use official New York
State prescription forms was revoked for two years; (4) on January 22, 1992, the Commissioner, New York Education
Department, Board of Regents, granted Respondent's application for a consent order with the State Board for Professional
Medical Conduct, which consent order suspended his medical license for a period of six years, stayed execution for
five years and placed his license on five years probation. As a result, Respondent was not licensed to practice medicine
in the State of New York for a period of one year beginning January 27, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent, through counsel, filed a request for a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter
was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held
in Albany, New York on January 13, 1994. On April 18, 1994, in his findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended
ruling, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration not be revoked
and that his application for renewal be granted. The Government filed exceptions to Judge Tenney's opinion. On May
23, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Deputy Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67,
hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that Respondent received a medical degree from Albany Medical College in 1967.
After a surgical internship in Connecticut, he entered a psychiatric residency at Albany Medical Center Hospital
and was subsequently made chief of psychiatry at Saint Peter's Hospital in Albany.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that in 1986, a review of controlled substance order forms by New York State officials
indicated that Respondent was receiving large quantities of the Schedule II controlled substance, amphetamine.
In response to a request for medical records, Respondent provided the state with order forms indicating his purchases
and a tabulation to account for his disposal of these drugs. Under New York State law, a practitioner is required to
complete a triplicate prescription form whenever he dispenses any Schedule II controlled substance, and to maintain
a patient record with evidence of examination, complaint, illness, and therapy. Respondent executed no such prescriptions
to account for his disposition of controlled substances. In response to a state request for more documentation, Respondent
claimed that his records were on computer. Respondent subsequently presented an extract of records for 17 patients.
State investigators were unable to locate nine of these patients, four others claimed they had received no such medication,
and one was a relative of Respondent's spouse. Investigators subsequently interviewed 40 other patients, of which
only five patients, all relatives of Respondent, verified that they had received the controlled substances that
Respondent attributed to them.

The administrative law judge found that on January 13, 1989, before the Albany County Court of the State of New York,
Respondent was convicted of one felony count of a violation of falsifying business records in the first degree, which
falsification referred to the dispensation of controlled substances. Respondent was sentenced to five years probation
which included a provision that he not dispense any controlled substances from his office. Subsequently, on November
12, 1990, Respondent voluntarily surrendered his DEA Certificate of Registration, AB7544314, for cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 29, 1991, Respondent and the New York State Board of Health entered a stipulation and order which found that during
the period February 1983 through November 1987, Respondent dispensed 9,850 dosage units of Schedule II controlled
substances without preparing a prescription; failed to make records of dispensing 5,060 dosage units of controlled
substances, and had made 32 false entries regarding controlled substances in nine patient care records. Respondent
was assessed a civil penalty of $30,000, of which $15,000 was stayed. On January 22, 1992, the Commissioner, New York
Education Department, Board of Regents, granted Respondent's application for a consent order with the State Board
for Professional Medical Conduct. The consent order suspended Respondent's medical license for a period of six years,
stayed execution for five years and placed his license on five years probation. As a result, Respondent was not licensed
to practice medicine in the State of New York for a period of one year beginning January 27, 1992. Respondent's medical
license was restored on January 28, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the hearing in this matter, Respondent testified that after his state conviction, he was concerned that his wife
not be prosecuted or charged with any violation of law. He stated that his wife, who had also been his office employee,
had been sick and was having problems with drugs. There was no indication that Respondent used drugs himself. Respondent
claimed that he voluntarily submitted to random drug testing and monitoring, that he never tested positive for drugs;
and that he will continue to be monitored for another four years. Respondent stated that it was his opinion that his
wife had taken the amphetamines, but he did not know how much. Respondent testified that he attempted to counsel his
wife for chemical dependency, and he did not get her help earlier due to the fact that he had a very high profile psychiatric
practice in town. His wife subsequently got involved with a rehabilitative program, now holds a top nursing job, and
has been ``clean'' from drugs for a number of years. Respondent conceded that he made a mistake in the way he handled
things and stated that it was an error in judgment to stonewall or attempt to cover up his wife's abuse of controlled
substances. Respondent felt that he paid for this mistake and is still doing so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that Respondent is currently employed as a staff psychiatrist for the State of
New York. Respondent presented testimony from his peers and supervisor that he was well-liked, extremely motivated,
hard-working, knowledgeable, and that he was considered exceptionally competent, an excellent clinician, and
made positive contributions to the state institution and his patients. Respondent's supervisor was of the opinion
that Respondent could competently assume the responsibilities of a DEA registration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), the Deputy Administrator may revoke a registration if he determines that such registration
would be inconsistent with the public interest. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest,
the following factors shall be considered:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.

(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator
may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
51 FR 17556 (1986).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that all five factors were relevant in determining whether Respondent's registration
should be revoked. As to the first factor, the administrative law judge found that Respondent has a current license
to practice medicine and handle controlled substances. As to the second factor, Respondent failed to execute prescriptions
to account for the disposition of Schedule II controlled substances, and attributed controlled substances to patients
who had not received them. As to the third factor, Respondent was convicted of one felony count of falsifying records
related to the dispensing of controlled substances. As to the fourth factor, Respondent violated New York State laws
relating to controlled substances, and surrendered his previous DEA Certificate of Registration for cause. As to
the fifth factor, the administrative law judge found that there was no indication that Respondent himself has abused
drugs, but Respondent inferred that his wife took the amphetamines due to her own drug problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that Respondent's guilty plea to the felony was motivated by his desire to spare
his wife from prosecution. The administrative law judge also found Respondent's testimony to be sincere, and gave
substantial weight to the fact that the State of New York had exacted full and fair retribution for Respondent's conviction.
Respondent was discharged from probation two and one-half years early, and has accepted responsibility for his conduct
and failures regarding his wife's chemical dependency, which has now been successfully treated. Consequently,
the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's registration not be revoked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Government filed exceptions to the recommendation of the administrative law judge contending that Respondent's
testimony had failed to respond to the issue of diversion of the controlled substances and his subsequent cover-up
activity; that Judge Tenney had applied undue weight to the character evidence presented by Respondent; and that,
in any event, Respondent has not shown that he does not pose a continuing threat to diversion, especially with regard
to Schedule II controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator concurs with the administrative law judge's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended
ruling in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant
to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that
DEA Certificate of Registration, BB0636021, issued to Charles A. Buscema, M.D., be and it hereby is, continued, and
that any pending applications, be, and they hereby are, granted. This order is effective on August 19, 1994.

 on July 26, 1994 (59 FR 37993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation findings show that the subject firm is an employee-owned company operating as a cooperative which
produces softwood plywood.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New findings on reconsideration show a substantial decline in employment in fiscal year (FY) 1994 compared to FY 1993.
Sales and production declines occurred in FY 1994 compared to FY 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subject firms's fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30. U.S. aggregate imports of soft plywood increased substantially
in 1993 compared to 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On reconsideration, the Department conducted a survey of Fort Vancouver Plywood's customers to determine whether
the ``contributed importantly'' test of Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act was met. The Department's
survey shows that customers accounting for a major portion of the subject firm's sales decline in FY 1994 increased
their imported purchases of plywood while decreasing their purchases from the subject firm.

Conclusion

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that workers and former
workers of Fort Vancouver Plywood in Vancouver, Washington were adversely affected by increased imports of articles
that are like or directly competitive with the softwood plywood produced at the subject firm. In accordance with the
provisions of the Act, I make the following revised determination for workers of Fort Vancouver Plywood in Vancouver,
Washington.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
On August 3, 1994, the Department on its own reopened its investigation for workers and former workers of the subject
firm. The initial investigation resulted in a denial for workers of J&amp;G Shake, Forks, Washington. The denial
notice will soon be published in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New investigation findings on reopening show a major customer increased its reliance on imported cedar shakes and
shingles in the relevant period. The customer accounted for the preponderance of the subject firm's sales decline
in the relevant period.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reopening, it is concluded that increased imports of articles
like or directly competitive with cedar shakes and shingles produced by J&amp;G Shake, Forks, Washington contributed
importantly to the decline in sales and production and to the total or partial separation of workers at J&amp;G Shake,
Forks, Washington.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the following revised determination:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By an application dated July 28, 1994, a former worker requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition
for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on June 23, 1994 and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36792).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The former worker stated that increased imports of aluminum ingot adversely affected workers at UCAR Carbon Company
producing calcined petroleum coke which is used to make carbon anodes for the production of aluminum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Worker Group Eligibility
Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. Aluminum is not interchangeable with calcined petroleum coke.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation findings show that UCAR Carbon in Robison, Illinois closed on May 1, 1994. The workers produced calcined
petroleum coke. The findings show that calcined petroleum coke at UCAR Carbon is used to make (1) Carbon anodes which
are used up in the production of aluminum and (2) graphite electrodes used in electric arc furnaces for steelmaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Articles which are consumed in the making of a finished article are not like or directly competitive with the finished
article. Calcined petroleum coke and aluminum are not interchangeable. Accordingly, imported aluminum is not like
or directly competitive with calcined petroleum coke within the meaning of Section 222(3) of the Trade Act. Therefore,
aluminum imports cannot be considered in determining import injury to workers engaged in employment related to the
production of calcined petroleum coke.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Trade Act did not intend to provide TAA benefits for everyone who is in some way affected by foreign competition,
but only for those workers of a firm which has experienced increased imports of articles that are like or directly competitive
with those produced at the subject firm. The increased imports must have ``contributed importantly'' to worker separations
and decreased sales or production at the workers' firm.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determination in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedes decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determination, 200 Constitution
Avenue, N.W., Room S&hyph;3014, Washington, D.C. 20210.

The American Folklife Center was created by the U.S. Congress with passage of Public Law 94&hyph;201, the American
Folklife Preservation Act, in 1976. The Center is directed to ``preserve and present American folklife'' through
programs of research, documentation, archival preservation, live presentation, exhibition, publications, dissemination,
training, and other activities involving the many folk cultural traditions of the United States. The Center is under
the general guidance of a Board of Trustees composed of members from Federal agencies and private life widely recognized
for their interest in American folk traditions and arts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Center is structured with a small core group of versatile professionals who both carry out programs themselves
and oversee projects done by contract by others. In the brief period of the Center's operation it has energetically
carried out its mandate with programs that provide coordination, assistance, and model projects for the field of
American folklife.

Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, requires NRC to disseminate information on abnormal
occurrences (i.e., unscheduled incidents or events that the Commission determines are significant from the standpoint
of public health and safety). During the first quarter of CY 1994, the following incidents at NRC licensees were determined
to be abnormal occurrences (AOs) and are described below, together with the remedial actions taken. The events are
also being included in NUREG&hyph;0090, Vol. 17, No. 1, (``Report to Congress on Abnormal Occurrences: January-March
1994''). This report will be available at NRC's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington,

_March 1992; Perry Nuclear Power Plant, a General Electric-designed boiling water reactor (BWR), operated by Cleveland
Electric Illuminating Company and located about 11 kilometers (7 miles) northeast of Painesville, Ohio.

Nature and Probable Consequences
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The main steam isolation, leakage control and outboard drain valves in three of four main steam lines penetrating
containment failed to meet the Technical Specifications limiting condition of operation (LCO) for leak tightness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For many BWRs, the LCO for leakage of each main steam isolation valve (MSIV) is 0.326 standard cubic meters (11.5 standard
cubic feet) per hour. Because it is difficult to measure the leakage of each valve individually, a maximum combined
allowed leakage is specified for the inboard and outboard MSIVs, and the associated control and drain valves. This
LCO is 0.71 standard cubic meters (25 standard cubic feet) per hour. During testing at Perry in 1992, the leakages through
the MSIVs were approximately 12 times allowable. Due to a history of poor performance and multiple main steam line
valve leakage, a detailed analysis of the 1992 MSIV leakage was performed. The analysis is required obtaining detailed
information from the licensee; a number of calculations, reviews, and subsequent reanalyses; and multiple meetings
among the staff to determine the impact on safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSIVs are designed to close and limit the release of radioactivity to the environment in the unlikely event of an accident.
When the Perry facility was issued an operating license, there was reasonable assurance that the MSIVs would operate
as intended, and the potential off-site doses resulting from postulated accidents, which includes assumptions
regarding fuel damage and fission product release, would be below the guideline values for release to the general
public. Because of the excessive leakage, the NRS staff, using conservative assumptions, calculated the potential
off-site doses to the general public that might result from a postulated loss-of-coolant accident. Using the very
conservative licensing basis calculational methodologies, the calculated dose exceeded the guidelines for release
to the general public. A more realistic calculation using the new approach presented in draft NUREG&hyph;1465, ``Accident
Source Terms for Light-Water Nuclear Power Plants'' (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NUREG&hyph;1465, ``Accident
Source Terms for Light-Water Nuclear Power Plants,'' Draft Report for Comment, June 1992) showed that the potential
off-site doses would not exceed the limits for release to the general public; however, additional measures would
be needed to minimize exposure of control room personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cause or Causes_The licenses determined the reason for the excessive MSIV leakage during the 1992 tests to be excessive
friction from oxide buildup, which caused end-of-stroke angular misalignment resulting in non-360-degree seat
contact (Licensee Event Report 50&hyph;440/92&hyph;006&hyph;01, ``Local Leak Rate Test Results Exceed Allowable
Primary Containment Leakage for Main Steam Lines A, B, and D,'' August 14, 1992). The reason for the difficulty of the
Perry MSIVs to meet test leakage limits is design geometry. The MSIVs are ``Y'' pattern valves with the valve stem at
45 degrees to the piping axis. To seat properly, translational motion of the poppet at the moment of impact must change
from the direction of the stem to a direction parallel to the axis of the pipe. Seating is made more difficult because
of the large size of the valves (66 centimeters [26 inches] diameter) and the weights involved (4500 kilograms [10,000
pounds]).

_In the early 1980s, Atwood &amp; Morrill, suppliers of the MSIVs, and the BWR Owners Group recognized the need for
better maintenance and for modification of the MSIVs. Modifications included improved poppet nose guides to overcome
eccentricity during seating and poppet anti-rotation devices. During the 1992 refueling outage, these modifications
were installed by the licensee on the six (out of eight) MSIVs which have had leakage problems (Licensee Event Report
50&hyph;440/92&hyph;006&hyph;01, ``Local Leak Rate Test Results Exceed Allowable Primary Containment Leakage
for Main Steam Lines A, B, and D,'' August 14, 1992). Based on leakage tests performed in 1993 and 1994, the modifications
were successful in significantly reducing MSIV leakage.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a therapeutic exposure to any part of the body not scheduled to receive
radiation can be considered an abnormal occurrence.

Nature and Probable Consequences
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_On December 9, 1993, at 5:20 p.m., a patient began a gynecological low-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment. The patient
was prescribed a treatment of 3000 centigray (cGy) (3000 rad) by a 48-hours exposure to approximately 2.3 gigabecquerel
(61.3 millicurie [mCi]) of cesium&hyph;137 (Cs&hyph;137).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 11, 1993, at approximately 7:30 a.m. (about 10 hours before the end of the prescribed treatment), the patient
intervened with the procedure by removing the implant containing three Cs&hyph;137 sources of approximately 730
megabecquerel (20.4 mCi) each, and placed it next to her thigh. Shortly after removing the implant, the patient showed
the device to the floor nurse. The nurse recognized the implant and understood the need for concern. She did not take
the device from the patient but reported the situation to her supervisor. The patient apparently returned the device
next to her thigh beneath the bed linen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of being informed, the nursing supervisor was experiencing difficulty with another patient, and was involved
in shift turnover. Due to these distractions, the supervisor failed to realize the urgent nature of the situation
and did not make required notifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On several occasions that morning, other licensee personnel entered the patient's room without realizing that the
radioactive source was exposed because it was covered by bed linen; the patient did not notify any additional staff
members that she had removed the implant. Approximately 21/2 hours after the estimated time of the source removal,
the attending physician attempted to perform a routine check of the implant and discovered that it had been removed
and placed next to the patient's thigh.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After properly accounting for and storing the sources, the physician examined and interviewed the patient. Based
on discussions with the patient and review of the exposure received, the attending physician terminated the treatment.
This decision was based on the physician's determination that the treatment received was clinically adequate and
his concern that the patient was a threat to herself and others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual dose delivered to the intended treatment site was calculated to be 2270 cGy (2270 rad). The written directive
was revised to reflect the lower dose delivered. The licensee's evaluation of the incident indicated that assuming
the implant remained in the same location for three hours, the maximum dose to the skin of the patient's thigh (the wrong
treatment site) was 572 cGy (572 rad). The licensee reported that no adverse effects to the patient are expected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The patient was notified verbally at the time the misadministration was discovered and then notified in writing on
January 13, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Cause or Causes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial cause of the misadministration was the patient's removal of the implant which was compounded by the failure
of the two nurses to follow emergency procedures. The nurses' failure to respond to the emergency resulted in approximately
21/2 hours of unnecessary exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The licensee determined that the nursing supervisor's failure to make the required notifications was due to the
lack of familiarity with established radiation safety procedures to which he/she had been trained. The licensee's
investigation of the event revealed that the lack of familiarity with radiation safety procedures was caused by the
infrequent handling of patients undergoing therapy with licensed materials (Letter from Hospital Metropolitano,
to H&eacute;ctor Berm&uacute;dez, Senior Inspector, NMI Section, NRC Region II, Forwarding a Misadministration
Report dated December 29, 1993, and an Addendum to the Misadministration Report dated January 11, 1994, Docket No.
030&hyph;11155, Licensee No. 52&hyph;16033&hyph;01). The licensee held a Radiation Safety Committee meeting
in which the incident and corrective actions to prevent recurrence were discussed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee decided to dedicate one floor of the hospital for all therapies involving NRC-licensed materials. This
will provide additional controls to allow the licensee to better ensure that nurses assigned to the floor are kept
current and familiar with operating and emergency procedures. The licensee is also evaluating the need to increase
patient awareness regarding non-intervention of procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee is revising its procedures for responding to radiological emergencies involving patients undergoing
radiopharmaceutical or sealed source therapy. As a minimum, the procedures will define what is a radiological emergency
and will provide examples of situations which must be considered radiological emergencies or which could result
in misadministrations. The licensee also committed to developing and implementing a retraining program based on
the revised emergency procedures for all hospital employees who may be involved in handling patients receiving radiation
therapy.

_A special inspection was conducted on December 15 and 17, 1993, to review the circumstances surrounding the misadministration
and the licensee's Quality Management program. A Confirmatory Action Letter (CAL) was issued to the licensee on December
30, 1993 (Letter from J. Philip Stohr, Director, Division of Radiation Safety and Safeguards, NRC Region II, to Hospital
Metropolitano, Attn: Mr. V&iacute;ctor Marrero, Administrator, forwarding a Confirmatory Action Letter, CAL
No. 2&hyph;93&hyph;14, Docket No. 030&hyph;11155, License No. 52&hyph;16033&hyph;01, dated December 30, 1993).
The CAL confirmed that the licensee would revise its emergency procedures and implement a training program, based
on new procedures, for all licensee employees who may handle patients undergoing radiation therapy. An NRC medical
consultant has been retained to perform a clinical assessment of this misadministration. The medical consultant's
report is expected to be available in time to discuss his findings in the second quarter AO Report. As of the issuance
of this report, NRC is pursuing escalated enforcement action against the licensee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_On December 20, 1993, Triangle Radiation Oncology Associates in Beaver, Pennsylvania, notified NRC of two potential
teletherapy misadministrations that occurred between December 13 and 17, 1993, at the licensee's Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
facility. The potential misadministrations were identified during a review of patient records on December 17, 1993,
when the licensee observed calculation errors involving the depth of the dose given to each of the two patients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both cases involved breast treatments where the original treatment plan prescribed 28 treatments of 180 centigray
(cGy) (180 rad) from a cobalt-60 teletherapy source (using 2 parallel opposed fields) for a total absorbed dose of
5040 cGy (5040 rad). The primary breast treatments were concluded on December 10, 1993. The physician wrote separate
written directives for each patient to receive an additional 1000 cGy (1000 rad) to the scar in 5 treatments of 200 cGy
(200 rad) per day. One of the written directives indicated that the absorbed dose was to be delivered at d
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
max
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the maximum extension of the teletherapy unit, which, as stated by the physicist, is typically a depth of 0.5 centimeter
(cm) (0.2 inch). The other written directive did not indicate a depth; however, the physician stated that the intended
depth was d

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
max
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, such a treatment plan would typically have been calculated by the teletherapy technologist at
the Pittsburgh facility and communicated by telephone to the teletherapy physicist at the Beaver facility to be checked.
However, this procedure changed when the computer at the Pittsburgh facility was taken out of service on December
1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 9, 1993, the teletherapy technologist hand wrote a paraphrased request of the written directive for the
two breast-treatment patients needing scar booster dose calculations. Rather than writing d
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
max
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the technologist stated the tumor dose at a depth of 5 cm (2 inch) and sent the request, via facsimile transmission,
to the teletherapy physicist at the Beaver facility. Hand calculations were performed for 200 cGy (200 rad) treatments
at a 5 cm (2 inch) depth, checked by a certified physicist, and sent back to the technologist, via facsimile transmission,
on December 9, 1993.

The patients were treated from December 13 to 17, 1993, and received doses of 1300 and 1320 cGy (1300 and 1320 rad) respectively,
rather than the 1000 cGy (1000 rad) intended. This resulted in misadministrations of 30 and 32 percent greater than
the intended dose. The licensee's physician stated that no adverse clinical effects are expected as a result of the
overexposures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the initial report, the licensee told NRC in subsequent telephone conversations that a recalculation of the
dose averaged over the entire tumor volume did not exceed 30 percent and, therefore, the licensee no longer thought
the definition of a misadministration applied in this case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC performed a special inspection on December 28 and 29, 1993, to review the potential misadministrations. Information
gathered during this inspection, including the calculations of the administered doses, was given to an NRC scientific
consultant to evaluate. The scientific consultant, in his report to NRC, stated that ``the dose prescription was
to d
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i.e., 0.5 cm [0.2 inch] depth on the central axis) and a misadministration can only be judged by considering the dose
given to this point. *&blank;*&blank;* clearly in both cases a misadministration has taken place.'' On March 25,
1994, the licensee was informed that the doses to both patients were deemed to be misadministrations. The licensee
submitted its report of misadministrations in a letter dated April 7, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After receiving the scientific consultant's report, an NRC medical consultant was retained to perform a clinical
evaluation of the patients. The medical consultant is still reviewing the potential health effects to the patients.
The consultant's report is expected to be completed in time to update this writeup in the next AO report to Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The referring physician was notified and determined that, based on medical judgment, informing the patients of the
misadministrations would be harmful.

_As prescribed by the licensees's Compliance Accountability and Control Procedures, in 1993, the licensee performed
an audit of all licensed sources at Armstrong Laboratory. During this audit, the licensee identified four missing
strontium-90 (Sr&hyph;90) reference sources of approximately 14.8 megabecquerel (400 microcurie) each. The licensee
conducted an extensive physical search for the sources and reviewed all radioactive material permits issued to other
organizations at Brooks AFB. When the disposition of the Sr&hyph;90 sealed sources could not be determined, the licensee
reported the loss of the four sealed sources to NRC by telephone on September 22, 1993. The licensee informed NRC that
the United States Air Force (USAF) Inspector General would review this incident. The licensee suspected that the
sources had been inadvertently discarded and transported to a sanitary landfill.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee evaluated possible radiation exposure to members of the general public and concluded that unless the
sources were removed from the container, the radiation levels from the sources would be near background level. Furthermore,
unless a deliberate effort was made to open the source capsules, an individual handling the sources would receive
less exposure than allowed by regulatory limits for the general public.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_During 1991, the timeframe during which the sources were apparently lost, a number of individuals were responsible
for the radiation safety program at Brooks AFB. These individuals were temporary or part-time Radiation Safety Officers
(RSOs), and had extensive, temporary duties at other sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of the USAF Inspector General's investigation determined that ``programmatic issues started to plague
radiation safety at Brooks AFB after the dismantling of the base/clinic program and the inception of additional duty
RSOs.'' The report explained that in 1986, the radiation safety function and responsibility was transferred to the
base clinic at Brooks AFB. Almost simultaneously, a Joint Military Medical Command (JMMC) was established and the
base clinic became a part of JMMC. JMMC was a medical command established to service all branches of the Armed Forces
in the San Antonio, Texas, area. With this action, the radiation safety program was managed by an organization that
was not responsible to any management level at Brooks AFB. Furthermore, the report stated that JMMC dismantled the
clinic's radiation safety program, and ``requested that all organizations previously under the clinic's program
establish and run their own radiation safety program.'' Exacerbating the problem was the appointment of the additional
duty RSOs, who had ``limited to general knowledge of radiation safety,'' and no directives or other guidance to assist
them. Additionally, ``the additional duty RSOs received little management oversight after they had been appointed
to the RSO position.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The investigation concluded that from 1986 through 1991, there had been a lack of commitment to management oversight,
and a serious disregard for radiation safety issues.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These violations were categorized as a Severity Level III and a Severity Level IV, respectively (Severity Level I

because of the Air Force's discovery of this violation and the promptness and comprehensiveness of the corrective
actions. The licensee has responded in writing to the Notice of Violation and no additional actions are required.

_On January 14, 1994, NRC was notified by telephone of a misadministration involving a leaking iodine-125 (I&hyph;125)
brachytherapy implant seed. On January 7, 1994, 16 I&hyph;125 seeds, each ranging from 370 to 1110 megabecquerel
(MBq) (10 to 30 millicurie [mCi]) activity, were implanted in the brain of a 30-year-old male patient. Following the
explant procedure on January 14, 1994, the licensee identified radioactive contamination in the surgical room and
bathroom used by the patient. Personnel from the licensee's radiation safety office identified the contamination
to be I&hyph;125 and confirmed that at least one seed was leaking. Further analysis by the licensee determined that
one seed was damaged during the implant procedure by a surgical staple. The seed originally contained 758 MBq (20.5
mCi) of I&hyph;125 and, based on an assay of the explanted source, the licensee estimated that the loss was approximately
74 MBq (2.0 mCi).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thyroid monitoring of the patient's visitors and hospital employees involved in the care of the patient was performed
by the licensee. One of the licensee's employees was determined to have received a committed dose equivalent to the
thyroid of 50 microsievert (&mu;Sv) (5 millirem [mrem]). In addition, a visitor was determined to have received a
committed dose equivalent to the thyroid of 540 &mu;Sv (54 mrem), or a total effective dose equivalent of 160 &mu;Sv
(1.6 mrem), which is less than the annual limit for members of the general public of 1000 &mu;Sv (100 mrem).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through patient monitoring, the licensee estimates that approximately 5 percent of the free I&hyph;125 was taken
up in the patient's thyroid. (In a normally functioning, unblocked thyroid, approximately 25 percent of the free
iodine would be taken up in an individual's thyroid.) The licensee estimates that the uptake would result in a radiation
dose to the thyroid of approximately 300 centigray (300 rad). The licensee does not expect any adverse medical effects
to the patient as a result of the misadministration. An NRC medical consultant concluded that the non-radioactive
iodinated contrast agent used during an imaging procedure performed on the patient prior to the implant blocked the
absorption of the I&hyph;125. He also concluded that exposure to the radiation levels described has resulted in an
increased probability of developing thyroid tumor(s) in the future.

implications of the incident. A followup NRC inspection (Letter from W.L. Axelson, Director, Division of Radiation
Safety and Safeguards, to Donald Harrison, M.D., Senior Vice President and Provost for Health Affairs, University

_A patient was prescribed a lung brachytherapy treatment delivered by an Omnitron 2000 high-dose-rate (HDR) remote
afterloader system. The prescribed tumor treatment plan included 1000 centigray (cGy) (1000 rad) absorbed doses
at 5 treatment positions using a 144.3 gigabecquerel (3.9 curie) iridium-192 source within a special needle. At the
end of fifth and last treatment, the source wire retracted 0.5 centimeter (cm) (0.2 inch) and stopped. Alarms immediately
alerted Keesler staff that the source remained inside the patient's body. Licensee personnel followed emergency
procedures, entered the therapy room and removed the needle from the patient. Once outside the patient's body, the
radioactive source retracted to the stored position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee determined that the source remained stuck at 0.5 cm (0.2 inches) above the fifth position for approximately
21/2 minutes. The treatment plan called for the delivery of 1000 centigray (cGy) (1000 rad) at 1cm from each of the 5
treatment positions. As a result of the additional 21/2 minutes exposure, the last treatment position received 1732
cGy (1732 rad) absorbed dose, or 73.2 percent over the prescribed dose. The treatment plan also predicted an 800 cGy
(800 rad) absorbed dose at 0.5cm (0.2 inch) from each of the 5 treatment positions. The point 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) above
the last treatment position, where the movement of the source stopped, received approximately 1400 cGy (1400 rad),
or 75 percent greater than the absorbed dose stipulated in the prescribed treatment plan. The failure of the source
to retract resulted in a single overexposure, causing an overall absorbed dose of 75 percent greater than that prescribed,
for all the tissue surrounding the position 0.5cm (0.2 inch) above the last treatment site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The patient had made a sudden move near the end of the treatment causing the special needle to bend at the point where
it extended beyond the biopsy needle. The bend prevented the radioactive source from retracting to the stored position,
causing the misadministration.

_A special inspection was conducted from January 19 to 21, 1994, to review the circumstances surrounding the misadministration
and the licensee's Quality Management program. A representative of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also
participated in this inspection. No violations of regulatory requirements were identified during the inspection,
but NRC initiated the following actions: (1) A Confirmatory Action Letter (Letter from James L. Milhoan, Regional
Administrator, Region IV, to Department of the Army, USAF Radioisotope Committee, HQ AFMOA/SGPR, Brooks AFB, TX,

dated January 18, 1994) was issued to the licensee on January 18, 1994, which prohibited the use of the HDR unit until
serviced by the manufacturer; (2) a medical consultant was contracted to evaluate the clinical effects and to assess
the events that led to this misadministration; (3) the manufacturer was asked to analyze the source wire involved
in the misadministration for damage as a result of the stresses experienced during this event; (4) Southwest Research
Institute was contracted to analyze the special needle for mechanical failure; (5) a generic communication is being
developed to notify other HDR users of the results of the inspection and related research; and (6) NRC is coordinating
with FDA an evaluation of the generic implications surrounding this event.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_On January 27, 1994, a patient was scheduled to receive a 500 centigray (cGy) (500 rad) brachytherapy treatment to
the trachea using a Nucletron high-dose-rate (HDR) remote afterloader system. A single catheter was used for this
endobronchial treatment and the licensee performed a routine simulated treatment. During this simulation, the
oncologist established a 3 centimeter (cm) (1.2 inch) tumor treatment site and added a 1 cm (0.4 inch) margin on both
ends of the tumor site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, at this time the medial physicist and the dosimetrist plot distances, measured in centimeters along the
length of the catheter shown in the simulation film, in order to program the HDR for precise treatment at the prescribed
treatment site. This step was not performed and the procedure was initiated without the HDR being properly programmed.
The unprogrammed source was allowed to travel beyond the treatment site into the left lung area where the catheter
ended. The treatment resulted in the prescribed 500 cGy (500 rad) effective dose equivalent being delivered to the
left lung instead of the trachea target site. Prior to administering the dose, the treatment plan and treatment console
printout were reviewed by the dosimetrist, the medical physicist, and the oncologist. All three individuals failed
to identify the failure to plot the treatment site. Immediately following the treatment, the licensee's medical
physicist realized that the plotting and programming of the treatment site were not performed. After discovery of
the treatment error, the oncologist determined that the patient should be treated again using the correct treatment
parameters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee has advised NRC that no adverse effects to the patient are anticipated as a result of this misadministration.
The licensee has informed the patient of the misadministration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The licensee's radiation therapy staff failed to follow the licensee's normal protocol for treatment with the HDR
remote afterloader. The failure to administer the treatment as prescribed resulted from performing the treatment
planning and independent verification in the vicinity of the HDR console, where there were a number of distractions.

_The licensee's corrective actions included immediate retraining of all personnel involved in brachytherapy treatments
and the addition of a checklist for each step in the treatment process. The licensee also added steps to its Quality
Management program for HDR brachytherapy. These steps now require the use of the treatment planning computer with
manual verification of the input parameter and the use of the treatment parameter card generated by the planning computer
to program the HDR rather than programming the HDR treatment parameters manually.

9. Abstract: The proposed amendments to 10 CFR 20 will require (1) That licensees required to submit to the Commission
a decommissioning plan or a notification of intent to decommission provide additional information to the Commission
in these submissions when seeking license termination under restricted conditions, and (2) applicants for new licenses
describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination, facilitate
decommissioning, and minimize generation of radioactive waste. Those licensees proposing license termination
under restricted conditions must submit a plan for establishing and supporting a Site Specific Advisory Board, and
develop operating procedures for the Board. All records generated or reviewed by the SSAB become a part of the license
docket. The rulemaking would ensure that decommissioning will be carried out without undue impact on public and occupational
health and safety and the environment and would enhance the existing regulatory framework by providing a clear and
consistent regulatory basis for determining the extent to which lands and structures must be remediated before a
site can be decommissioned. The additional recordkeeping requirements would document the role of public participation
in the licensing process and that sites have been decommissioned in accordance with the regulations.

a show cause proceeding pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 to modify, suspend or revoke the Licensee's operating licenses for
Palo Verde Generating Station (Palo Verde); (2) initiate `'appropriate actions'' to cause the Licensee to recognize
the Buckeye, Arizona Regional Office of the National Whistleblower Center, as an agency to which Licensee employees
may raise safety concerns about operations a Palo Verde without fear of retaliation by the Licensee; (3) initiate
``appropriate actions'' to cause the Licensee to encourage employees at Palo Verde to contact the Buckeye, Arizona
Regional Office of the National Whistleblower Center, to identify safety concerns about operations at the facility
as part of its procedural requirements to ensure a working environment which is free of hostility and promotes the
raising of safety concerns by employees without fear of retaliation; and (4) initiate ``appropriate actions'' to
cause the Licensee to encourage employees at Palo Verde to contact the NRC to identify safety concerns about operations
at the facility as part of its procedural requirements to ensure a working environment which is free of hostility and
promotes the raising of safety concerns by employees without fear of retaliation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 18, 1994, Petitioner supplemented his Petition by requesting that the NRC require Licensee contractors: (1)
To provide information regarding filing complaints with the Department of Labor (DOL) to their employees ``as part
of their normal employment package'', and (2) to properly post the NRC Form 3 in and around the contractor's place of
business and site business trailers and offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After due consideration of Petitioner's assertions, the Licensee's response, and Petitioner's supplemental information,
the Director, Office of Enforcement, has denied the Petition. The reasons for the denial are explained in the ``Director's
Decision under 10 CFR 2.206'' (DD&hyph;94&hyph;08) which is available for public inspection in the Commission's
Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of this Decision will be filed with the Secretary for the Commission's review in accordance with 10 CFR 2.206.
As provided by this regulation, the Decision will constitute the final action of the Commission 25 days after the date
of issuance of the Decision unless the Commission on its own motion institutes a review of the Decision within that
time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BG&amp;E/licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DRP&hyph;53
and DRP&hyph;69, which authorizes operation of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2 (the facilities).
The licenses provide, among other things, that the facilities are subject to all the rules, regulations, and orders
of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter the effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facilities are pressurized water reactors located at the licensee's site in Calvert County, Maryland.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in
nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), in part, states that ``the licensee shall
establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security organization which will have as its objective
to provide high assurance that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense
and security and do not constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), specifies that, ``the
licensee shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' The Code of Federal Regulations
at 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) also requires that, ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals
who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' It further states that individuals not employed by
the licensee (e.g., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided that the individual,
``receives a picture badge upon entrance into a protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected
area *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access system which would eliminate the need to issue
and retrieve picture badges at the entrance/exit location to the protected area and would allow all individuals,
including contractors, to keep their picture badges in their possession when departing the Calvert Cliffs site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated March 23, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5).
Specifically, the requested exemption would allow contractors who have unescorted access to retain possession
of their picture badges instead of returning them as they exit the protected area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may upon application of any interested person or
upon its own initiative, grant such exemption in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger
life or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. The Code of Federal Regulations
at 10 CFR 73.55 allows the Commission to authorize a licensee to provide alternative measures for protection against
radiological sabotage provided the licensee demonstrates that the alternative measures have the same ``high assurance''
objective, that the proposed measures meet the general performance requirements of the regulation, and that the
overall level of system performance provides protection against radiological sabotage equivalent to that which
would be provided by the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, unescorted access into the protected area for both employee and contractor personnel into the Calvert
Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, is controlled through the use of picture badges. Positive identification
of personnel which are authorized and request access into the protected area is established by security personnel
making a visual comparison of the individual requesting access and that individual's picture badge. In accordance
with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contractor personnel are not allowed to take their picture badges offsite. In addition,
in accordance with the plant's physical security plan, the licensee's employees are also not allowed to take their
picture badges offsite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed system will require that all individuals with authorized unescorted access have the physical characteristics
of their hand (hand geometry) registered with their picture badge number in a computerized access control system.
Therefore, all authorized individuals must not only have their picture badge to gain access to the protected area,
but must also have their hand geometry confirmed. All individuals, including contractors, who have authorized unescorted
access into the protected area will be allowed to keep their picture badges in their possession when departing the
Calvert Cliffs site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other access processes, including search function capability and access revocation, will remain the same. A
security officer responsible for access control will continue to be positioned within a bullet-resistant structure.
It should also be noted that the proposed system is only for individuals with authorized unescorted access and will
not be used for those individuals requiring escorts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sandia National Laboratories conducted testing which demonstrated that the hand geometry equipment possesses
strong performance characteristics. Details of the testing performed are in the Sandia report, ``A Performance
Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices,'' SAND91&hyph;0276 UC&hyph;906 Unlimited Release, June 1991.
Based on the Sandia report and the licensee's experience using the current photo picture identification system,
the false acceptance rate for the proposed hand geometry system would be at least equivalent to that of the current
system. To assure that the proposed system will continue to meet the general performance requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5),
the licensee will implement a process for testing the system The site security plans will also be revised to allow implementation
of the hand geometry system and to allow employees and contractors with unescorted access to keep their picture badges
in their possession when leaving the Calvert Cliffs site.

For the foregoing reasons, the NRC staff has determined that the proposed alternative measures for protection against
radiological sabotage meet the same high assurance objective and the general performance requirements of 10 CFR
73.55. In addition, the staff has determined that the overall level of the proposed system's performance will provide
protection against radiological sabotage equivalent to that which is provided by the current system in accordance
with 10 CFR 73.55.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, this exemption is authorized by law, will
not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants the following exemption:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) that individuals who have been granted unescorted access and are not employed
by the licensee are to return their picture badges upon exit from the protected area is no longer necessary. Thus, these
individuals may keep their picture badges in their possession upon leaving the Calvert Cliffs site.

<DOCTITLE>Wisconsin Electric Power Company; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR&hyph;24 and DPR&hyph;27, issued to Wisconsin Electric Power Company (the licensee), for operation
of the Point Beach Nuclear Plant (PBNP), Units 1 and 2, located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments would modify Point Beach Nuclear Plant Technical Specifications (TS) 15.3.4, ``Steam and
Power Conversion System,'' and 15.3.7, ``Auxiliary Electrical Systems,'' to increase the allowed outage times
for one motor driven auxiliary feedwater pump and for the standby emergency power for the Unit 1 Train B 4160 Volt safeguards
bus (A06) from 7 to 12 days. The proposed amendments would also modify TS 15.3.3, ``Emergency Core Cooling System,
Auxiliary Cooling Systems, Air Recirculation Fan Coolers, and Containment Spray,'' to provide the clarification
that the service water pump (P&hyph;32E) operating with power supplied by the Alternative Shutdown System is operable
from offsite power. The changes are one-time extensions of specific allowed outage times.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not; (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the license
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's
analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's review is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The probability of an accident previously evaluated
will not be significantly increased because no changes are being made to the facility or to its operation which can
significantly affect the potential for an accident. The only change is an extension of an already acceptable allowed
outage time. The consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not be significantly increased because the
licensee is taking compensatory measures to offset the increased outage time. These measures include verified operability
of the gas turbine generator, cessation of maintenance and test activities that could cause loss of required equipment,
assurance of at least three offsite power sources, and on-call status of a senior reactor operator with detailed knowledge
of the planned evolutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The amendment only extends the allowed outage time. The
changes do not affect the manner in which equipment can fail such that a new or different kind of accident can occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a
margin of safety because compensatory measures are being taken (discussed above) to compensate for the increase
in the allowed outage time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By September 19, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the
subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes
to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules
of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy
of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Joseph P. Mann Library, 1516 Sixteenth Street,
Two Rivers, Wisconsin 54241. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John Hannon, Director, Project Directorate III&hyph;3: petitioner's name
and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts, and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20037, attorney for the licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 4, 1985, the Commission issued Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;42 to Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating
Corporation (the licensee) for Wolf Creek Generating Station, Unit 1. The license provides, among other things,
that it is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now
and hereafter in effect.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section III.D.1(a) of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 requires, ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;a set of three Type A tests
[Overall Integrated Containment Leakage Rate Tests, or ILRTs] shall be performed, at approximately equal intervals
during each 10-year service period. The third test of each set shall be conducted when the plant is shutdown for the
10-year plant inservice inspections.'' By letter dated October 27, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from
this requirement of the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, that (1) Are authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and
security; and (2) present special circumstances. Section 50.12(a)(2) of 10 CFR Part 50 describes special circumstances
as including cases that would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or are not necessary to achieve the underlying
purpose of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter also dated October 27, 1993, the licensee applied for an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;42
to change related provisions of the Wolf Creek Generating Station Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Type A test is defined in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section II.F, as a ``test intended to measure the primary reactor
containment overall integrated leakage rate (1) After the containment has been completed and is ready for operation,
and (2) at periodic intervals thereafter.'' The licensee conducted ILRTs during October 1988 and September 1991
that satisfied the requirements of Appendix J and related technical specifications. The measured leakage rates
during these tests were well below the acceptance criteria with the majority of leakage being from containment penetrations
and not the containment barrier itself. The requested exemption does not affect the performance of local leakage
rate testing which would be expected to detect the most probable sources of containment leakage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to schedule the next ILRT such that it coincides with the 10-year inservice inspections, as required by Appendix
J, the licensee has requested a one-time exemption and related technical specification changes to perform the test
during the eighth refueling outage. The eighth refueling outage is currently scheduled for Spring 1996 and would
result in a test interval of approximately 54 months with the test being performed approximately six months after
the end of the first 10-year service period. In the absence of the exemption and related technical specification changes,
the licensee would be required to perform an ILRT during both the seventh and eighth refueling outages. This discrepancy
results from the circumstances related to the operating cycle schedules and their correlation with the end of the
10-year service period. Performance of a fourth ILRT coincident with the 10-year inservice inspections is clearly
beyond the intent of the regulations or technical specifications which specifically require three tests during
10-year service intervals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons set forth above, the NRC staff concludes that this one-time relief from the requirement to perform
the third ILRT within a 10-year service is not significant in terms of complying with the intent of Appendix J, Section
III.D.1(a). Accordingly, the staff finds that the performance of ILRTs during both the seventh and eighth refueling
outages would not result in a commensurate increase in the confidence of containment integrity. Therefore, the subject
exemption request meets the special circumstances of 10 CFR 50.12, in that the fourth test is not necessary to achieve
the underlying purpose of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On this basis, the NRC staff finds that the licensee has demonstrated that special circumstances are present as required
by 10 CFR 50.12. Further the staff also finds that extending the schedule for the third ILRT to beyond the 10-year service
period will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, this exemption is authorized by law and will
not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR
part 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 27076).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 28, 1994, the FHWA and the FTA Administrators jointly issued guidance to their respective regional administrators
on the implementation of the Federal certification of the metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) (transportation
management area (TMA)) planning process. This guidance outlines the principles and interim procedures that will
be utilized in implementing the certification process required under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act (ISTEA) and as further articulated in the US DOT regulations.

This notice also announces the schedule of FY 1994 reviews as known at this time. As indicated in the attached certification
guidance, the FHWA and FTA are planning approximately twenty reviews for FY 1994, approximately half of which will
be pilots for the purpose of testing and refining the review process. Interested parties are invited to submit comments
on the individual planning processes to be reviewed.

As part of an ongoing commitment to public involvement in the planning process, the FHWA and FTA are soliciting comments
on this guidance. As the agencies conduct certification reviews in FY 1994 we will be looking at possible modifications
based both on the experience of having conducted the reviews and on the comments received on the guidance and during
the reviews. Specifically, the FHWA and FTA are interested in comments regarding the process of review, appropriate
sources of information to be considered during the review, and the role of key government officials and the public
in providing input to the review.

 Notice, comments on metropolitan planning processes under review must be received within 30 days of the scheduled
review in order to be considered during the certification review process. Where the review was completed prior to
publication of this notice, interested parties wishing to make comments on a particular certification, must contact
Sheldon Edner within two weeks of the date of this notice to assure that their comments will be considered. Where dates
for a planned certification review have not been established, please contact Sheldon Edner for the dates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The site visits are intended to provide an opportunity for the FHWA and FTA review team to solicit information from
the MPO, State DOT and transit agency regarding the implementation of the planning process. In addition, the team
will be experimenting with alternative mechanisms for soliciting public and local official input. The relevant
MPO is being asked to provide public notice, through its regular public notice processes, of the review and the opportunity
to provide public input to the review team. Public officials should contact the MPO to identify processes set up to
solicit local government input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of the certification reviews will be made public through the regular MPO public information process at
a time to be set by the MPO policy board.

The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) has significantly enhanced the stewardship
role of the FTA and FHWA in the implementation of the changes it mandates in the transportation planning process. Inherent
within the approval of Statewide Transportation Improvement Programs (STIP), planning findings, conformity determinations
and certification of the transportation planning process in Transportation Management Areas (TMA) is the fundamental
leadership responsibility of FTA and FHWA in ensuring that the transportation planning process addresses the policy
goals of the ISTEA. This memorandum articulates our general agency expectations with regard to this planning stewardship
and the specific function that certification plays within this broader framework. While certification of the Metropolitan
Planning Organization (MPO) TMA planning processes falls within the purview of the metropolitan planning regulations,
the basic principles apply to both the statewide and metropolitan planning requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We view certification of the planning process within TMAs as one of a number of the critical mechanisms for ensuring
the satisfactory implementation of the planning requirements identified in 23 U.S.C. l34 and 49 U.S.C. 1602. It is
perhaps most critical in the sense that it will be a very visible action and formal indication that we have exercised
our legal responsibility in meeting this stewardship function. However, the individual planning findings, necessary
conformity determinations and STIP approvals provide critical input to this triennial action. We expect our regions
to establish procedures for implementing this joint responsibility. While the substance of these decisions must
remain consistent across regions, the variation in workload posed by the distribution of TMAs will dictate procedural
accommodations by region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The attached statement of principles and guidance provides a framework for addressing the implementation of the
certification requirement. We expect the responsibility for issuing certification determinations to rest jointly
with our field offices, working in partnership with Headquarters. The effective implementation of the certification
process will require a significant allocation of resources which you should address in the development of regional
staffing and travel budgets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Especially in this initial effort and in recognition of the phase-in provisions of the metropolitan planning regulations
(Section 45.336), we expect the emphasis to rest on ensuring a good faith effort to implement plan updates and the priorities
indicated in the attachment. We also expect that the message conveyed to MPOs, state DOTs and transit operators collectively
will be that they are mutually responsible for the continuing enhancement and improvement of the planning process
to meet the objectives of the ISTEA planning requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We expect the primary responsibility for implementing our stewardship role to rest with FTA and FHWA field staff.
However, this is manifested not only in the certification process, but also in STIP approvals, Transportation Improvement
Program (TIP) and STIP planning findings, conformity findings, and unified planning work program approvals. In
recognition of our national stewardship role and mandate from the ISTEA, we plan to conduct Enhanced Planning Reviews
(EPR) in selected metropolitan areas which will be integrated with the certification processes for the respective
metropolitan areas. These EPRs will be done at the request of states, MPOs, transit operators or FTA/FHWA field or
Headquarters offices to pursue more complex planning process questions and to assist MPOs in improving their procedures.
As a supplement to these EPRs, we plan to develop and implement an overall assessment of the planning process and its
implementation under the ISTEA requirements over the next three fiscal years. The results of the planning reviews
will provide input to this analysis. The challenge and the expectations are such that we believe that a very visible
and substantial assessment is necessary to demonstrate our joint commitment and success in providing the leadership
expected of both agencies. You will be hearing more about this initiative as it is developed.

We will be discussing the attached certification procedures and guidance with your offices at opportunities over
the next several weeks. In conjunction with FHWA's Advance Planning Seminar which is scheduled for the week of April
10, we expect to have FHWA and FTA field staff participating in this seminar assist us in refining the attached certification
procedures and guidance. Additionally, we will meet with field staff during May to discuss the certification process
in more detail after additional guidance has been developed. As indicated in the attached paper, once this meeting
has been held and the guidance refined, Headquarters staff will participate with field staff in conducting a pilot
certification review in each region. Certification reviews should not be initiated by field staff pending the issuance
of the additional guidance and/or completion of the pilot certification reviews. If you have questions on certification,
please contact Deborah Burns, Office of Planning, TGM&hyph;21, at (202) 366&hyph;1637 or Sheldon Edner, Office
of Environment and Planning, HEP&hyph;21, at (202) 366&hyph;4066.

&bull;Must be a joint action by FHWA and FTA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Must be based on a serious examination of the planning process that documents the adequacy of the planning process.
However, the workload involved in reviewing the planning process for approximately 135 MPOs once every 3 years combined
with other oversight and administrative responsibilities demands a process that utilizes and builds on the other
oversight functions including TIP findings, Unified Planning Work Program approvals and conformity findings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The certification process must recognize the differences among areas and not expect each area to respond to
the requirements to some predefined minimum level/standard. The goal should be to encourage an improved planning
process in each area rather than a process that only minimally meets the requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Process must recognize that certification is likely to involve negotiated improvements and schedules rather
than pass or fail ratings. In this vein, the ISTEA sanction provisions are viewed as a ``last resort'' action to be used
in situations where the parties involved are unresponsive to needed corrections or there are very serious inadequacies
in the planning process. In almost all cases, it is likely that the ``planning finding'' process discussed below would
probably have identified deficiencies and may have already affected the advancement of projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;While certification is the formal mechanism provided by ISTEA for determining the adequacy of the planning
process in TMAs, a ``once-every-three-years-look'' at the planning process is not sufficient to ensure that the
planning process, its products, and our actions related to the planning process meet the requirements. Fortunately,
the regulations provide additional mechanisms for assuring the adequacy of the planning process, i.e., the planning
finding that must be made on each TIP/TIP amendment in all metropolitan planning areas prior to its inclusion in an
approved STIP, the air quality conformity determination process in nonattainment and maintenance areas, and the
review and approval of the planning work programs for all metropolitan areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The planning finding provides a mechanism for identifying problems and requiring immediate corrective action without
going through the more formal certification process. In addition, the planning finding process can provide an early
warning mechanism for initiating a certification review prior to end of the normal 3 year certification period as
well as in highlighting parts of the planning process that need to be examined in more depth as part of regularly scheduled
certification reviews (and conversely identifying those parts that are clearly meeting the regulatory requirements
and therefore require less review in the certification process). Although pre-ISTEA planning findings may have
relied primarily on the State and MPO self-certification statements, this is not expected to be the case under the
regulations. It is expected that FHWA/FTA as part of the planning findings process will review the adequacy of public
involvement, financial constraint, relationship of projects in TIP to the transportation plan, and satisfaction
of the provisions relating to the restriction on SOV projects in TMAs that are nonattainment for carbon monoxide and/or
ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conformity regulations require consultation with a number of agencies (including FHWA and FTA) on key elements
of the metropolitan planning process, including models to be used, proposed plans and TIPs, research and data collection
related to the transportation planning process. The concerns that may be raised through this consultation process
will provide another mechanism for identifying potential shortcomings in the planning process. Additionally,
as part of the conformity determination in nonattainment areas requiring TCMs, FHWA and FTA must specifically consider
comments concerning the financial feasibility of the plan and TIP made through the conformity consultation process
and the metropolitan planning public involvement process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where review of the work programs indicates that essential activities for complying with the regulations are not
being adequately undertaken and/or the proposed schedules for completing the activities do not satisfy regulatory
requirements, the need for revisions to the work program can be addressed. Where there is not a positive response,
FHWA and FTA can pursue this through action on the UPWP or a certification review could be initiated without waiting
the normal three years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It is expected that FHWA and FTA field staff will involve themselves in the planning process on at least a selective
basis, e.g., participation in key MPO meetings, monitoring TIP revisions, etc. This can be a valuable mechanism for
not only surfacing potential problems and deficiencies in the planning process, and in initiating corrective action
but also providing contact with local officials. This is an enhancement of the traditional planning oversight role
of FHWA and FTA field offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Enhanced planning reviews (EPRs) similar to the ones that FHWA and FTA have been doing in areas over a million
can provide valuable input to the certification reviews and other oversight functions. For example, where FHWA and
FTA identify an apparent shortcoming in the technical process, a comprehensive review of this portion of the process
could be undertaken with Transportation Systems Center (TSC) staff. They could also be used to do ``peer'' type reviews
on a selected or request basis. In what ever form, these EPRs will require substantial additional resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reviews conducted under the FHWA Office of Program Review annual review program may also augment the certification
reviews and other oversight functions. For example, last year implementation of the flexibility provisions and
administration of joint FHWA/FTA projects was the subject of one of the reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Individual certification reviews should be tailored to reflect the information available from other oversight
activities. While this may not be a significant factor for the certifications performed in the remainder of FY&hyph;94,
this will become a significant factor as other oversight functions reflect the regulatory requirements. This means
that while all aspects of the process will be addressed in the certification findings a significant amount of the information
needed to make a decision on certification will be obtained from other oversight activities and day-to-day involvement
in the planning process. It is expected that the certification process will include a discussion of the findings with
the MPO policy body.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certification reviews in the balance of 1994 (at least) will need to be done with the recognition that MPOs, States,
and transit operators will have had little time to address new regulatory requirements and even less time to consider
any nonregulatory guidance that may be issued to supplement the regulations. These reviews need to focus on how well
they have addressed the interim guidance and what they are doing to begin to address the additional requirements in
the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Guidance for DOT staff conducting certifications will have to be developed. This may include manuals, certification
forms, checklists, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;FHWA and FTA field staff will be the primary staff involved in certifying MPOs. An assessment will have to be
made on training that may be necessary to equip DOT staff to perform certification reviews. One potential mechanism
in lieu of any formal training is for Headquarters to lead the initial certification review in each Region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the process, the areas identified below represent focal points in the first round of certification reviews.
They have been the subject of keen interest by several key constituencies, represent priority issues to FHWA and FTA
and have been the subject of numerous questions by MPOs, States, and transit agencies. These areas should be addressed
in a general way, reflecting the phase-in of the planning requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifteen Factors_The planning regulations (58 FR 58040) require that the 15 factors be explicitly considered and
analyzed as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Involvement_The metropolitan transportation planning process should include provisions that encourage
and ensure early and continuing involvement of citizens, affected public agencies, representatives of transportation
agency employees, private providers of transportation, and other interested parties in the development of plans
and TIPs, and in all other stages of the planning process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major Transportation Investments_Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) and their planning partners must
undertake detailed and participatory corridor and subarea studies of any major corridor investments contained
in a regional plan. These studies will include detailed analysis of the forecasted effectiveness of alternative
investments and strategies in terms of a broad array of criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congestion Management System_In TMAs, the planning process must include the development of a Congestion Management
System (CMS) that provides for effective management of new and existing transportation facilities through the use
of travel demand reduction and operational management strategies. In TMAs that are nonattainment for carbon monoxide
and/or ozone, Federal funds are not to be programmed for highway projects that increase Single Occupant Vehicle (SOV)
carrying capacity unless such projects result from a CMS, meaning, in essence, that Transportation Demand Management
(TDM), transit, operating strategies, and other actions must be looked at as alternatives to new highway construction.
Even if such strategies cannot completely satisfy the need for additional capacity, they must be implemented in conjunction
with the SOV capacity enhancements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The planning process and Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 conformity_In nonattainment and maintenance areas,
the MPO must have an adequate process to ensure conformity of plans and programs with State or Federal implementation
plans, in accordance with procedures contained in the rules resulting from the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Financially constrained plans and TIPS_The regulations require that MPOs have in place a process that produces current
metropolitan plans and TIPs that are financially feasible. Plans must demonstrate the consistency of proposals
with known and reasonably expected sources of revenue for transportation uses. The TIP must be financially constrained
and include a plan that demonstrates how it can be implemented without detriment to operation and maintenance of the
existing transportation system, and only projects for which funds can reasonably be expected to be available may
be programmed. The metropolitan TIP is incorporated into the financially constrained State TIP which is jointly
approved by FHWA and FTA. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, funds for projects in the first two years of a TIP
must be available or committed.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Spillway at Crow Creek Dam is on the verge of failure. Failure of the spillway could lead to the catastrophic failure
of the dam, endangering lives and property in the floodplain between the dam and Lake Francis Case on the Missouri River.
During its 55-year life, the reservoir has trapped approximately 5,000 acre-feet of sediment which has reduced its
water-storage capacity from 7,000 to 2,000 acre-feet. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was necessary to
address the impact of controlled or catastrophic release of the sediment. Six alternatives for renovation are considered
in the document.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Crow Creek Sioux Tribe has a contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to perform Safety of Dams activities
at Crow Creek Dam. The Tribe contracted the EIS work to Morrison-Maierle/CSSA of Helena, MT; a private engineering
consultant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six alternatives were considered, including No Action. The BIA has chosen Alternative 6 as a preferred alternative.
Alternative 6 will breach the dam, drain the reservoir, naturally stabilize the reservoir sediments, and eventually
return the reservoir area to a naturally vegetated condition. The existing concrete spillway will be removed and
the reservoir will be lowered by excavation of the underlying material. A period of 5 years will be used to stage the
breaching of the dam so that the amount of sediment released downstream will be minimized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Crow Creek Sioux Tribe favors Alternative 6 as an interim remedy to relieve the existing safety hazard since funding
for other alternatives is not available. The tribe prefers, as a permanent rehabilitation, Alternative 2 which involves
rehabilitation of the dam with a design flood capacity of 55,000 cfs and operation to flush sediment. The five-year
phased breaching of the dam will be performed in a manner that will allow pursuit of Alternative 2 if funds become available.
Alternative 2 would include the construction of a new spillway, a new outlet works, and possibly installation of roller-compacted
concrete overtopping protection for the dam embankment. The outlet works would have a greater capacity for flushing
of sediment. While sediment flushing would prolong the life of the reservoir, it would make establishment of fish
populations very difficult. Eventually the reservoir would fill with sediment and become wetlands and riparian
habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BIA has committed to monitoring sediment losses from the reservoir during the implementation period of Alternative
6. Appropriate mitigation will be developed if significant impacts occur during the staged breach.
