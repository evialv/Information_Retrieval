<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are amending the Fruits and Vegetables regulations by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adding San Luis Rio Colorado to the list of definite areas in Sonora, Mexico, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be free from certain injurious insect pests and from which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apples, apricots, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates, and tangerines may be imported without
treatment for these pests. We have determined that this municipality is free from certain injurious insect pests
known to occur in Mexico and known to attack these fruits. This action allows the importation of these fruits into the
United States from San Luis Rio Colorado, in accordance with the regulations. We also are making other nonsubstantive
changes for clarity.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The regulations in 7 CFR 319.56 through 319.56&hyph;8 (referred to below as the regulations) restrict the importation
of fruits and vegetables to prevent the introduction and dissemination of certain injurious insects, including
fruit and melon flies, that are new to or not widely distributed within and throughout the United States. Paragraphs
(e) and (f) of &sect;319.56&hyph;2 contain requirements for the importation of certain fruits and vegetables based
on their origin in a definite area or district. The definite area or district must meet certain criteria, including
criteria designed to ensure that the area or district is free from all or certain injurious insects. Paragraph (h)
of &sect;319.56&hyph;2 lists municipalities in Sonora, Mexico, that are considered free of five listed insect pests:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ceratitis capitata, Anastrepha ludens, A. serpentina, A. obliqua, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A. fraterculus. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Apples, apricots, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates, and tangerines from municipalities
in Sonora, Mexico, listed in paragraph (h) may be imported into the United States without treatment for these five
insect pests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a document published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 25, 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 44779&hyph;44780, Docket No. 93&hyph;095&hyph;1), we proposed to add San Luis Rio Colorado to the list of municipalities
in Sonora, Mexico, determined to be free from the five listed insect pests and from which apples, apricots, grapefruit,
oranges, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates, and tangerines may be imported into the United States without treatment
for these pests. We have determined that San Luis Rio Colorado meets all the criteria contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;319.56&hyph;2 (e)(4) and (f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending September 24, 1993. We received
one comment by that date from a State agency. The commenter expressed concern regarding Mexican Government enforcement
efforts to prevent the introduction of fruit flies into San Luis Rio Colorado and requested any pertinent information
that we used in formulating the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have since responded to the commenter and have provided him with the pest risk assessment we used in adding San Luis
Rio Colorado to the list of Sonoran municipalities considered to be free of fruit flies. As indicated in the pest risk
assessment, the Mexican Government performs fruit fly trapping surveys adequate to detect any fruit fly infestation
in San Luis Rio Colorado. The Mexican Government also maintains roadside inspection stations to prevent the introduction
of fruit flies through incoming produce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposal as a final rule without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Immediate implementation of this rule is necessary to provide relief to those persons who are adversely affected
by restrictions we no longer find warranted. Making this rule effective immediately will allow interested producers
and others in the marketing chain to benefit from this additional source of fruit. Therefore, the Administrator of
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should be effective upon publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The action allows the importation of apples, apricots, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates,
and tangerines from San Luis Rio Colorado into the United States without treatment for the five listed insect pests.
This action could increase imports of these articles into the United States, since import costs will be lowered through
the elimination of treatment costs. The small entities that could be affected by this action include fumigators at
the Mexican border, importers of the above-listed fruits, and domestic growers, distributors, and retailers of
these fruits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic impact on these entities should be insignificant since the amount of fruit imported into the United States
from San Luis Rio Colorado is expected to be very small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information, we anticipate that only imports of oranges, peaches, and possibly grapefruit may
increase as a result of this rule. Further, if imports of oranges and peaches from Sonora and imports of grapefruit
from Mexico in general were to increase 10 percent from 1992 levels, this increase would amount to less than one percent
of total U.S. production and less than one percent of total U.S. imports of these commodities. Consequently, we do
not estimate any changes in prices or costs of fresh oranges, peaches, or grapefruit as a result of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule allows fruit to be imported into the United States from San Luis Rio Colorado, Mexico. State and local laws
and regulations regarding fruit imported under this rule will be preempted while the fruit is in foreign commerce.
Fresh fruits are generally imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public, and will remain
in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases
must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. No retroactive effect will be given to this rule, and this rule will not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) hereby adopts regulations for specific crop provisions to insure
Small Grains (wheat, barley, flax, oats, and rye), and options for increased coverage on Winter Wheat and Malting
Barley. This rule consolidates the provisions for insuring small grains into one policy and provides for late planting,
prevented planting, and wheat winter coverage.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Departmental Regulation 1512&hyph;1. This action
constitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of these regulations under those procedures.
The sunset review date established for these regulations is July 1, 1998.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Kenneth D. Ackerman, Manager, FCIC, has determined that this action is in conformance with Executive Order 12866
and is not a ``significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, it has been determined
that this final rule: (1) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities;
(2) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
(3) would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; and (4) would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the information collection or record-keeping requirements included in this final rule have been submitted for
approval to the Office of Management and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. The insurance companies
delivering these policies will not increase the amount of work required over the previous policy delivery. In fact,
the combination of a number of previously independent policies into one policy should reduce confusion and increase
efficiency. Therefore, this action is determined to be exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety.
Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The small grains crop provisions were developed to provide one policy form for insuring wheat, barley, flax, oats,
and rye. Using one policy for these five crops will: (1) Substantially reduce paperwork by issuing one policy form
rather than the five separate policies previously used; (2) substantially reduce the number of crop handbooks and
administrative procedures because separate handbooks and procedures will no longer be required for each of the small
grain crops; (3) reduce the time involved to amend or revise the Provisions by eliminating repetitious review processes;
and (4) continue to allow insureds the flexibility to elect any of the five small grain crops they wish to insure.

Six comments suggested that the Crop Provisions should be delayed until after the 1994 crop year because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Timeliness_Implementation of this program for the 1994 crop would cause confusion and disruption because companies
had insufficient time for training and marketing of the program to agents and insureds;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Program Integrity_The effect upon the overall public acceptance and program integrity will be negative as a result
of the inevitable service problems associated with ``rushing'' a program of such national scale; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Changes_To a large degree, most of the proposed provisions are positive and will improve the program; however,
by delaying implementation until the 1985 crop year specific provisions can be studied.

Two comments suggested the proposed Small Grains Crop Provisions undergo a pilot test in two to three county groupings
located in (1) a predominantly spring wheat only area, (2) a winter wheat only area, and (3) an area having significant
acreage of both winter and spring wheat. The comments stated that this approach would avoid undue risk of adverse effects
to a wheat program currently working well for thousands of policyholders. An additional comment recommended that
the proposal be tabled for further study and discussion to give all parties sufficient time to adequately assess the
effects of the proposed changes.

One comment stated that the definition of ``practical to replant'' contained in the Common Crop Insurance Policy
conflicts with the Small Grains Crop Provisions. The Common Crop Insurance Policy indicates it is practical to replant
until 20 days after the final planting date. The Small Grains Crop Provisions indicate that any acreage of the insured
crop damaged before the final planting date must be replanted unless FCIC agrees that replanting is not practical.
It was recommended that a definition of ``practical to replant'' be added to the Small Grains Crop Provisions that
will override the definition contained in the Common Crop Insurance Policy.

The comment misapplies the definition of ``practical to replant'' in the Common Policy. That policy does not indicate
that it is practical to replant until 20 days after the final planting date but, to the contrary, states that it is not
practical to replant after that date. The provisions do not conflict. A new definition has not been added due to this
comment. However, a new definition has been added that is compatible with the new 25 day late planting period.

Language contained in the Crop Insurance Handbook is interpretive and procedural in nature. The Crop Insurance Handbook
details unit division for various crops, and is intended for use by insurers and their agents to interpret the crop
provisions. In the event of conflict the provisions control. The Small Grains Crop Provisions outline the unit structure
for small grains in a concise manner and are controlling.

One comment disagreed with requiring insureds to furnish records for each optional unit for at least the last crop
year the unit was planted. According to current procedure, ``in order for optional units to apply, the insured must
have provided production reports for the most recent year in the base period which support the optional units proposed
by the insured.'' The comment asserts that unless all optional units are planted every year, the new policy could require
an insured to furnish records for several years to qualify for optional units. This places an increased burden on all
producers, particularly on those practicing crop rotation. The comment recommended revising the provision to ``You
must have verifiable records of production for at least the last crop year used to determine your production guarantee.''

Requirements for separate units have been met if the break in the planting pattern is adequate to allow measurement
of individual insurance units, and allow separate harvest of the units. The terms are self explanatory. Whether a
break exists depends on whether these functions can occur. No changes in policy language are needed to clarify boundary
requirements.

Separate optional units for initially planted winter and spring wheat are allowed by this regulation, although farmers
who elect this choice will forgo the premium discount for maintaining a single unit. These terms are consistent with
those terms given to a producer who elects to plant spring and winter wheat into separate sections.

The Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement provides optional coverage for those growers who may not wish to replant damaged
winter wheat. However, the Basic Policy requires that crops damaged prior to the final planting date be replanted
when practical. This requirement helps FCIC maintain lower premium rates.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some comments were in disagreement with the provision allowing insureds to select optional units for initially planted
winter wheat and initially planted spring wheat for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Currently, production from winter wheat acreage often off-sets losses on spring wheat acreage. Allowing optional
units by type can only increase the loss ratio in those areas where both winter and spring types wheat are planted and
insured. To increase risk exposure by allowing winter and spring wheat units when other changes are concurrently
being implemented in the program to decrease the loss ratio seems to create a conflict.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. There is no appreciable difference in harvesting and marketing the soft white winter wheat and the soft white spring
wheat grown in the northwest. Although a yield difference does exist between the two types of wheat, yield differences
also exist for many other crop practices and types not allowed separate optional units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. If optional units are allowed by type, a significant increase in losses could result. According to information
from some member companies who have analyzed prior year losses by type, loss ratios for wheat would have been substantially
higher if winter and spring wheat could have been insured as a separate optional units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. One organization had not received any requests for optional units by type from companies, agents, or insureds,
and therefore did not see the need for the provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments provided the following observations and inquiries:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Will the cost of the options in provisions governing Unit Division be prohibitive?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Production of spring wheat and winter wheat is commingled more often than not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Allowing winter and spring optional units may significantly increase risk. FCIC should analyze winter and spring
statistics to determine if an additional rate should be charged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The provision allowing optional units for initially planted Winter Wheat and initially planted Spring Wheat will
permit growers who have insufficient acreage to plant in separate sections and declare separate optional units.
Large producers will also be able to declare separate optional units, and the net effect will increase the number of
wheat units. This may have a negative effect on FCIC's loss ratio. The provision will also increase the paperwork burden
of the already overburdened claims adjuster.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Changes or adjustments to the program should be sensitive to rating adequacy and reduction of excess of loss ratios.
Some of the provisions of the program contradict these goals. For instance, analyses by companies and industry trade
associations do not support the notion that no additional rate is required for optional units by type. As proposed,
optional units by type can only be justified as a marketing tool in some areas of the country.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Separate units for winter and spring wheat have been requested by grower groups in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon.
FCIC agrees that farmers should have the opportunity to designate initially planted spring and winter wheat as separate
optional units because they are planted several months apart and are normally harvested separately. FCIC also agrees
that soft white wheat types may be marketed together. However, there are substantial price penalties for commingling
production of spring and winter wheat of other types.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCIC has analyzed types of wheat reported by unit for the states in which both winter and spring types are insured. An
average of only 7 percent of all units in these states reported both winter and spring types within the same unit. The
majority, or 93 percent of all units, reported only a single type within the unit. These results suggest that most farmers
already manage their land in a manner that permits them to put the winter and spring types into separate optional units.
This is accomplished by planting the types within different legally defined sections of land. Thus, FCIC believes
that the potential for increases in the number of optional units is not substantial. Most farmers who have enough land
and who wish to designate separate optional units already do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Farmers who designate separate optional units by type within the same section will forgo the premium discount that
is currently allowed if a basic unit is not separated into optional units. Thus, farmers who elect to designate units
by type of wheat within the section will pay more premium than a farmer who elects to retain all acreage within a basic
unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments concerning additional paperwork are overstated. Farmers already are required to report separately
any acreage planted to the spring and winter types within section because different premium rates, insurance guarantees,
or both, apply to such acreage. The only difference in the acreage report under the new provision is that two distinct
unit numbers will be used by the insurer rather than one as at present. Farmers will be required to report the production
of the two types separately, which they already may do in many cases. FCIC cannot estimate the number of cases in which
a new report may be required. The former wheat endorsement required only that insured persons report the total production
of all the insurable crop produced on the unit. If a farmer elects to report only total production under the present
arrangements, the accuracy of the guarantees for the types is reduced because the insurer must allocate the production
in some manner to establish a guarantee by type. If farmers who now report the combined production of the two types within
section do designate separate optional units, the change may enhance the precision of guarantees for the separate
types, thereby benefiting the insurer. If the farmer already reports production of the two types separately, there
will be no change in the paperwork required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Insured persons who wish to take advantage of the opportunity to designate separate optional units within a section
must comply with all other requirements for unit division. Thus, if a producer commingles production of the winter
and spring types, separate optional units may not be elected. If a producer plants spring wheat into a failed winter
stand, separate optional units may not be elected. If planting patterns do not permit separate identification of
the acreage, optional units may not be elected. If a producer wishes to reduce the premium paid for the insurance, he
or she can elect to retain all the acreage in a basic unit. The new provisions do not mandate separate optional units.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, much of the research about units referenced in the comments relates to size of acreage, not specifically
to unit division. Results of such research suggests that small farmers should pay higher premiums than large farmers
because small acreage may have higher losses on average. Although the issues is related, FCIC believes that the issues
should be treated separately. If it is ultimately demonstrated that small acreage should be subject to a surcharge
due to actuarial considerations, the surcharge should be assessed against small acreage regardless of whether these
result from small farming operations or from unit division.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, FCIC does not find these comments persuasive.

which they were formed.''

The Crop Insurance Handbook now indicates that these types of written agreements must be sent to FCIC, and be postmarked
no later than 15 days after the acreage reporting date. Since reinsured insurance contracts are between the reinsured
company and the insured, the contract should not contain obligations that exist between FCIC and the reinsured company.
Therefore, language indicating that requests must be received by FCIC within 15 days of the acreage reporting date
will not be included in the crop provisions.

FCIC agrees that applicability of the provisions should not be limited to wheat. Only acreage intended to be harvested
for grain qualifies as an insurable crop. Therefore, if it is known at the acreage reporting date that the acreage will
be destroyed, it is not insurable. The provision that allows an insured to designate only wheat acreage as uninsurable
acreage has been changed to apply to all covered crops. The provision that provides for a reduced premium rate if acreage
is destroyed by a certain date, has been changed so that it applies only in those counties for which such a reduced rate
is included on the actuarial table. This change will allow FCIC to provide a ``short rate'' only in areas where small
grain crops are most commonly used for multiple purposes, e.g., grazing and harvest for grain.

One comment noted that it is extremely important that shifting liability procedure be reinstated. Acreage is reported
by unit and the insurance company requires the insured to indicate on the acreage report the acreage he plans to destroy,
however, insureds often do not know at acreage report time exactly which acres will be destroyed. Therefore, the company
is asking for information that is often unknown at the time the acreage report is filed. Shifting liability procedure
is an equitable method of addressing the situation.

Two comments indicated that the wheat provision will allow any insured producer whose wheat sustains early damage
to destroy any remaining wheat, pay a reduced premium rate, and receive a full indemnity. The comments suggested that
the provision should be changed to prohibit this practice, and to require the insured to notify the insurer prior to
destroying any insured wheat.

FCIC agrees that the reduced premium should apply only when there is no insurable damage. FCIC also agrees that the
insured should notify the insurer prior to and after destruction of any acreage of the insured crop. This notification
will allow the insurer to make any necessary inspections and adjustments to the Acreage Report. The provision has
been revised accordingly.

Two comments indicated that the provisions for destroyed acreage are difficult to assess without seeing the proposed
prorata premium charges, or the deadlines which will be designated in the Special Provisions. The comments asked
if the expense reimbursement to reinsured companies for acreage destroyed by the deadline in the Special Provisions
would be calculated using the total premium or the reduced premium.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Premium rates for destroyed acreage will vary in accordance with the probability of loss in individual geographic
areas. If insurable damage occurs prior to the crop being destroyed by the grower, the loss will be processed in the
normal manner and 100 percent of the premium will be due. Expense reimbursement will also be calculated on this basis.
If the insured destroys the acreage by the date designated in the Special Provisions and does not claim insurable damage
on such acreage, the reduced rate will be used to determine the premium and the reduced premium will be used to determine
the expense reimbursement.

Provisions for late planting coverage have been added to these provisions in order to provide more complete coverage
for insureds. If insureds are allowed to opt out of the coverage it may result in adverse selection against the insurer.
When agronomic conditions are good many insureds would tend to opt out of the coverage, but if growing conditions are
poor, insureds would tend to keep the coverage.

FCIC has received comments indicating that the wheat final planting dates are now set as late as it is normally practical
to plant. The additional planting period allowed by the Late Planting Agreement Option (LPAO) permits planting too
late in the year to expect production equal to or in excess of the insurance guarantee provided by the Option. Although
coverage similar to that provided by the current LPAO will no longer be available, coverage for winter wheat planted
after the final planting date will be available under the prevented planting provisions (section 12). FCIC received
no comments opposed to removing the LPAO for winter wheat.

 One comment indicated concern that the replant provision could be interpreted to mean that a crop that had sustained

to the extent that growers in the area would not further care for the crop must be replanted unless replanting is not

 The provision that applies to these questions is unchanged from the present wheat endorsement. Actuarial tables
for the counties in question do not designate a wheat type. When a type is not designated, the guarantee is based on wheat
production without regard to the type. This guarantee is used for APH purposes and is also used to determine whether
or not an adequate stand exists.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For winter wheat in counties that only have a spring final planting date, the policy states that insurance will attach
on the earlier of the spring final planting date or the date the insurer agrees to accept the acreage. The policy also
requires insureds planting winter wheat in these counties to request insurance for winter planted wheat. One comment
suggested that because the insurer must inspect the crop to determine if an adequate stand exists, insurance should
attach when the insurer agrees to accept liability (not on the spring final planting date). The comment suggested
that the applicable sentence in subparagraph 7.(a)(2)(v) should be revised to read as follows: ``*&blank;*&blank;*
Insurance will attach to acreage having an adequate stand on the date we agree to accept the acreage for insurance.''

 The basic coverage under the wheat provisions is similar to the existing wheat endorsement. The changes (primarily

Language indicates that crop damage caused by insects or disease is covered unless the damage is due to insufficient
or improper application of control measures. It has always been the loss adjustor's responsibility to determine
if good farming practices are carried out by the producer. This responsibility includes determining if cultural
practices necessary to control insects and disease are followed. The new language does not change current loss adjustment
procedures, or give loss adjustors the latitude to require unreasonable control measures. The language is intended
to clearly advise insureds that they are expected to take control measures that typically would be used in the area.

Five comments were received opposing paying replant payments for wheat. The comments stated that: (a) Insureds have
not requested replant payments for spring wheat; (b) insureds are currently replanting or ``sweetening'' stands
at their own minimal expense; (c) replant payments for spring wheat will not reduce indemnity payments because insureds
already replant at their own expense; (d) the cost of replanting wheat is much less than other spring crops; (e) unnecessary
increased loss adjustment expense will result; (f) if FCIC persists with implementation of this proposal, provisions
addressing these increased expenses should be made; (g) without a commensurate increase in rates, adding a replant
payment has the net effect of increasing the loss ratio; (h) this provision will tremendously impact the loss adjustment
expense; (i) the replant provisions are extremely hard to react to on a timely basis and very expensive to administer;
and (j) replants on row crops are normally confined to smaller areas with fewer miles to travel. The same is not applicable
to other small grains.

The intended effects of replanting payments are to: (1) Provide coverage requested by wheat growers; (2) provide
reimbursement to insureds for replanting expenses; (3) reduce indemnities by encouraging replacement of damaged
or destroyed crops; and (4) provide equity among the various crops. FCIC understands that administrative costs will
be associated with this coverage, however, replant payments are a loss control mechanism and may outweigh any additional
administrative costs. Comments received did not establish findings that all damaged acreage is presently replanted
in the absence of a payment.

an insurable cause of loss in order for a replay payment to be made.

 The provisions require that wheat be damaged to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent
of the production guarantee for the unit to qualify for a replant payment. One comment stated that these provisions
conflict with the winter coverage options because the options indicate a replant payment can be made on a portion of
a unit. The comment recommended changing the language to allow a replant payment if the remaining stand will not produce
at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage as opposed to the unit.

 The provisions do not include any limitation regarding the date an insured can replant and be eligible for a replanting
payment. One comment recommended adding a provision requiring that acreage be replanted within 25 days after the
spring final planting date to remain eligible for a replant payment. The comment also recommended clarifying if ``sweetening''
is considered replanting.

 One comment stated that the replant payment provisions do not indicate the consequences when wheat is replanted using
a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting. The comment recommended the following language be added
to clearly indicate what happens in such a situation: ``When wheat is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable
for an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium
amount will be based on the original liability.''

extended to barley, oats, rye and flax.

 One comment stated that the proposed provisions do not link the time notice is given with the requirement to leave representative
samples of the insured crop. In addition, the provisions do not clearly indicate that a sample is required for each
field in the unit. The comment recommended that there be some indication that the requirements in this provision are
in addition to the insured's duties contained in the Common Crop Insurance Policy. The comment also recommended that
the following language be used: ``In addition to your duties contained under section 14 of the Common Crop Insurance
Policy (&sect;457.8), if you initially discover damage to any insured crop within 15 days of, or during harvest, you
must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 feet
wide and the entire length of each field in the unit, and must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection
or 30 days after harvest is completed on the unit.''

 This provision requires that representative samples be left when notice of damage is given within 15 days of, or during
harvest. It does not apply only when the producer is going to destroy the acreage. The intent of this provision is to
enable the loss adjustor to have a reasonable amount of time to inspect a portion of the undisturbed crop and determine
the extent of insurable damage. After the crop is harvested it can be extremely difficult to accurately determine
the extent of insurable damage.

 According to current procedure, mixed grains may be quality adjusted if the predominant grain is separable from other

is a procedural matter and will remain in loss adjustment procedure handbooks.

 Grain graders licensed under the United States Warehouse Act are authorized to inspect, weigh, and grade grain for
the purposes of warehouse receipts. Ability to grade grain varies considerably. When grade problems exist and elevator
personnel are unable to adequately establish the quality, samples are generally sent to Federal Grain Inspection
Service (FGIS) for a grade determination. FGIS has the authority to make final grade determinations. Insurers who
are uncomfortable with grade determinations made by individuals licensed under the United States Warehouse Act
should send samples to FGIS for final grade determination. Specialized tests, such as tests for vomitoxin, must be
performed by a qualified laboratory. Language specifying that specialized tests must be performed by a laboratory
approved by the insurer has been added to the provisions.

 Four comments indicated that it is difficult to assess provisions of the Winter Coverage Endorsement without knowing
the premium rates. One of the comments points out that dissatisfaction would occur with the Endorsement when premium
rates are published. The author of another comment expressed concern that the proposed Options may erode the affordable
value of the insurance product in counties currently covered by the Winter Coverage Option/Fall Seeded Endorsement.
If Option B is priced too high, it may cause a migration of business to the less expensive Option A or the basic endorsement.
The result would be less significant protection, on an affordable basis, and an overall devaluation of the effectiveness
of the insurance product in counties that currently have the Winter Coverage Option.

One comment submitted the following questions: If an insured chooses to destroy damaged acreage covered by the Wheat
Winter Coverage Endorsement, can they destroy only damaged acres, or do they have to destroy all the remaining acres
in the unit? Is spring wheat insurable on acres indemnified under Winter Wheat Option A? Will the insured qualify for
a replant payment on those acres?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The insured may destroy only the damaged acres on the unit and qualify for coverage as long as at least 20 acres or 20 percent
of the acreage in the unit does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee
for the acreage. Under Option A, an insured may choose to have the acreage appraised, destroy damaged winter wheat,
or plant spring wheat on the acreage and insure it separately. If the insured chooses to accept an appraisal of the remaining
potential, a replant payment is not allowed, even if the acreage is replanted to spring wheat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of paragraph 3 do not prevent a replant payment for acreage replanted after the spring final planting
date. It is not necessary to extend coverage after the period covered by the Winter Coverage Endorsement.

One comment stated that the word ``damage,'' used in the Winter Coverage Endorsement, can be interpreted to mean that
a crop which has suffered one percent damage can either be replanted, carried to harvest or destroyed. The comment
recommended that ``damage'' be qualified to mean damaged to the extent that the crop does not have the potential to
produce the yield used to determine the production guarantee, will not be further cared for, will not be harvested
or will be abandoned.

Coverage under both Options A and B is limited to situations in which at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the acreage in
the unit, whichever is less, is damaged to the extent that it does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent
of the production guarantee for the acreage (see first paragraphs under Options A and B).

Two comments indicated that since one of the choices the insured has under the Winter Coverage Option is to replant
to spring wheat, the notice of damage should be required by the spring final planting date. The deadline for notice
of loss under the current Fall-Winter Coverage Option is the spring final planting date.

Eight comments were received regarding coverage limitations under Option A of the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement.
The comments stated that limiting coverage for damaged wheat to 30 percent of the production guarantee, after the
time period covered by the Endorsement, is inappropriate. A crop carried on after the winter coverage period would
have a potential much greater than 30 percent of the production guarantee. Two of the comments recommended allowing
coverage to remain at the full production guarantee when the insured continues to care for the crop. One comment recommended
allowing coverage to remain in place at the actual crop potential.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Option A limited coverage to 30 percent of the production guarantee even if the insured elected to carry the damaged
wheat to harvest. FCIC has revised Option A to allow coverage to continue based on the full guarantee if the production
potential on the spring final planting date is such that growers in the area continue to maintain the crop.

The author of one comment submitted the following questions: Under Option A of the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement,
is 70 percent of the production guarantee levied against total production on damaged acres only? What if there is winter
damage and the insurer was not informed until after harvest?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Option A clearly indicates that the amount of production to count will not be less than 70 percent of the production
guarantee for the damaged acreage. If notice of damage is not given in accordance with policy provisions, and such
lack of notice interferes with determination of covered damage, a claim may not be payable for the unit.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment outlined concerns that the coverage under Option A will not be sufficient to cover production costs incurred
before the crop must be destroyed. The comment also inquired about the actual premium costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Option A of the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement is designed as a lower cost alternative to the full coverage of Option
B. Although full production costs may not be covered, there is a significant increase in coverage over the base policy
which does not provide protection unless the crop is replanted. Rate determinations cannot be made until the Endorsement
provisions are finalized. The premium rates for Option A will reflect the coverage provided by regulations published
in this final rule.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments were received regarding the provisions in the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement that allow an insured
to destroy damaged wheat acreage, replant the acreage to spring wheat, and consider such replanted acreage as a separate
crop. One comment indicated that the endorsement may cause program abuse by encouraging an insured to gamble and seed
winter wheat if he is normally a spring wheat producer. If there is not a good stand in the spring, the insured could destroy
the crop, collect an indemnity, and plant spring wheat as is normally done. The second comment indicated that the provision
will cause FCIC to insure two different crops of wheat on the same acreage during one crop year, which could cause a myriad
of administrative problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As written, both Option A and B allow an insured to destroy damaged winter wheat, receive any applicable indemnity
payment, and then replant to spring wheat. The spring wheat can then be insured separately for a separate premium.
If the insured is forced to include acreage replanted to spring wheat as part of the winter unit, a significant coverage
provided by the options is eliminated. FCIC does not anticipate the administrative difficulties will be unmanageable.

One comment stated that Option B provides better coverage than Option A and will be more attractive to insureds. The
comment found no appreciable differences between the new Option B and former Winter Coverage Option for wheat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Option B is not similar to the current Winter Coverage Endorsement. Option B allows spring wheat (planted to replace
damaged winter wheat) to be treated as a separate crop. The current Endorsement requires that spring wheat in this
situation be a part of the winter wheat unit. This new choice provides more comprehensive coverage than the current
Endorsement.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC has considered and incorporated the recommendations of the Billings Regional Service Office and the Montana
Committee. The recommendations were to: (1) Include a clearer definition of the entity (i.e., a brewery or business
that makes or sells malt or processed mash to a brewery) contracting with the insured to produce malting barley; and
(2) clearly state that the insurer's liability under the Option is limited to the lesser of the number of contracted
bushels or the production guarantee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment inquired if malting barley basic units can be divided into optional units by section/ASCS FSN and/or irrigated/non-irrigated
acreage. The comment stated that if this division is possible, paragraph 4 of the Malting Barley Option needs to be
revised to refer to the Small Grains Crop Provisions, not the Basic Provisions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph 4 of the Malting Barley Option refers to the ``Basic Policy,'' not the ``Basic Provisions.'' The ``Basic
Policy'' includes all provisions applicable to small grains (both the Common Crop Insurance Policy, and the Small
Grains Crop Provisions). Revision is not necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the interim between publication of the Small Grains Crop Provisions as a proposed rule and preparation of this
final rule, provisions providing coverage for Late and Prevented Planting were added to the current Wheat Endorsement
(&sect;401.101), Barley Endorsement (&sect;401.103), and Oat Endorsement (&sect;401.105). These provisions
for Late and Prevented Planting Coverage, which were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 22, 1993, have been incorporated into this final rule to continue the coverage provided by the current
endorsements for barley, oats, and wheat, and to provide the same coverage benefits to those insuring flax or rye.
In addition, FCIC has determined that revised language is needed in subparagraph 11.(c)(1)(iv) regarding acreage
an insured wants to put to another use prior to harvest. These provisions now allow an insured to destroy such acreage
when an appraisal amount is not agreed upon, if the insured agrees to leave representative samples of the crop in place.
The samples will be used to later determine the amount of production to count.

Practical to replant_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(subsection 1.(ff) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8) does not apply to small grains.) Our determination,
after loss or damage to the insured crop, based on factors, including but not limited to moisture availability, condition
of the field, time to crop maturity, etc., that a replanting of the insured crop will attain maturity in the remainder
of the crop year. It will not be considered practical to replant after the end of the late planting period or the final
planting date if a late planting period is not applicable (see section 7) except that it may be determined practical
to replant after the end of the late planting period or the final plant date if such procedure is generally occurring
in the area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You must have been unable to plant the insured crop due to an insured cause of loss that is general in the area (i.e., most
producers in the surrounding area are unable to plant due to similar insurable causes) and that occurs between the
sales closing date and the latest final planting date for the insured crop in the county or within the late planting

2. Unit Division
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless limited by the Special Provisions, a unit as defined in subsection 1.(tt) of the Common Crop Insurance policy
(&sect;457.8) may be divided into optional units if, for each optional unit you claim, all the conditions of subsections
2.(a), (b), and (c), and the conditions of paragraph 2.(d)(1), (d)(2, or (d)(3) are met, or if we agree to such division
in writing. Optional units must be established at the time you file your report of acreage for each crop year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) You must have verifiable records of planted acreage and production for each optional unit for at least the last
crop year used to determine your production guarantee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) You must plant the crop in a manner which results in a clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundaries
of each optional unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) You must have measurements of stored production or market production from each optional unit in a manner that permits
us to verify the production from the optional unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each optional unit must meet one or more of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Optional Units by Section, Section Equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Optional units may be established if each optional unit is located in a separate section. In the absence of sections,
we may consider parcels of land legally identified by other methods of measure including, but not limited to: Spanish
grants, railroad surveys, leagues, labors, or Virginia Military Lands. In areas which have not been surveyed using
the systems identified above or another system approved by us, and in areas where boundaries are not readily discernable,
each optional unit must be located in separate ASCS Farm Serial Number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Optional Units on Acreage Including Both Irrigated and Non-Irrigated Practices: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to or instead of establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number,
optional units may be established if each optional unit contains only irrigated acreage or only non-irrigated acreage.
The irrigated acreage may not extend beyond the point at which your irrigation system can deliver the quantity of water
needed to produce the yield on which your guarantee is based. You must plant, cultivate, fertilize, or otherwise care
for the irrigated acreage and the non-irrigated acreage in an appropriate manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Optional Units by Initially Planted Winter Wheat or Initially Planted Spring Wheat: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For wheat only, in addition to or instead of establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or ASCS Farm
Serial Number as described in paragraph 2.(d)(1) or by irrigated and non-irrigated practices as described in paragraph
2.(d)(2), optional units maybe established if each optional unit contains only initially planted winter wheat or
only initially planted spring wheat. Optional units may be established in this manner only in counties having both
fall and spring final planting dates as designated by the Special Provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basic units may not be divided into optional units on any basis (production practice, type, variety, planting period,
etc.) other than as described under this section. If you do not comply fully with these conditions, we will combine
all optional units which are not established in compliance with these provisions into the basic unit from which they
were formed. We may do this at any time we discover that you have failed to comply with these conditions. If failure to
comply with these provisions is determined to be inadvertent, and if the optional units are combined, the premium
paid for electing optional units will be refunded to you.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the requirements under section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for determining
Indemnities) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8) you may select only one price election for each crop
insured under this policy in the county.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In which you have a share;

insured if allowed by the Barley or Oat Special Provisions, or if we agree in writing to insure such mixture. The crop
insured will be the grain which is predominate in the mixture. The production from such mixture will be considered
as the predominate grain on a weight basis);

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) That is not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Interplanted with another crop except as allowed in paragraph 6.(a)(2); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Planted into an established grass or legume; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Planted as a nurse crop, unless planted as a nurse crop for new forage seeding, but only if seeded at a normal rate
and intended for harvest as grain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) We may agree, in writing, to insure a crop prohibited under paragraph 6.(a)(3) if you so request. Your request to
insure such crop must be in writing, and submitted to your agent not later than 15 days after the acreage reporting date.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If you anticipate destroying any acreage prior to harvest you: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) May report all planted acreage when you report your acreage for the crop year and specify any acreage to be destroyed
as uninsurable acreage. (By doing so, no coverage will be considered to have attached on the specified acreage and
no premium will be due for such acreage. If you do not destroy such acreage, you will be subject to the under-reporting
provisions contained in subsection 6.(f) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8)); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the actuarial table provides a reduced premium rate for acreage destroyed by a date designated in the Special
Provisions, you may report all planted acreage as insurable when you report your acreage for the crop year. Premium
will be due on all the acreage. Your premium amount will be reduced by the amount shown on the Actuarial Table for any
acreage you destroy prior to a date designated in the Special Provisions if you do not claim an indemnity on such acreage.
In accordance with subsection 14.(b) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8), you must obtain our consent
before and give us notice after you destroy any of the insured crop so your acreage report can be revised to make you eligible
for this reduction in premium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In counties for which the Wheat Special Provisions designate both fall and spring final planting dates, you may
elect a winter coverage endorsement for wheat. This endorsement provides two options for alternative coverage for
wheat that is damaged between the fall final planting date and the spring final planting date. Coverage under the endorsement
will be effective only if you designate the coverage option you elect by executing the endorsement by the sales closing
date for winter wheat in the county.

In lieu of the requirements under section 11 (Insurance Period) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8),
and subject to any provisions provided by the Wheat crop insurance winter coverage endorsement (&sect;457.102)
if you have elected such endorsement, the insurance period is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Insurance attaches on each unit or part thereof on the later of the date we accept your application or the date the
insured crop is planted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For oats, rye and flax, the following limitations apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for the insured
crop except as allowed in subsection 12.(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would
normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that replanting is not practical (see subsection
1.(o)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For barley and wheat, the following limitations apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for the type
(winter or spring) except as allowed in subsection 12.(c).

(ii) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a fall final planting date, any acreage of winter barley or wheat
damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for
the crop, must be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Whenever the Special Provisions designate both fall and spring final planting dates, winter barley or wheat
planted on or before the final planting date which is damaged: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Before the fall planting final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further
care for the crop, must be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) On or after the fall final planting date, but before the spring final planting date, to the extent that growers in
the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to an appropriate variety of the insured crop
unless we agree that replanting is not practical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If you have elected coverage under one of the available wheat winter coverage options available in the county, the
insurance period for wheat will be in accordance with the selected options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whenever the Special Provisions designate a spring final planting date, any acreage of spring barley or wheat
damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for
the crop, must be replanted to a spring type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a spring final planting date, any acreage of fall planted barley
or wheat is not insured unless you request such coverage and we agree in writing that the acreage has an adequate stand
in the spring to produce the yield used to determine your production guarantee. Insurance will then attach to acreage
having an adequate stand on the earlier of the spring final planting date or the date we agree to accept the acreage for
insurance. If such fall planted acreage is not to be insured it must be recorded on the acreage report as an uninsured
fall planted crop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

8. Causes of Loss
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the provisions under section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy, any loss covered
by this policy must occur within the insurance period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific causes of loss for small grains are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Adverse weather conditions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Fire; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Insects, but not damage allowed because of insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Plant disease, but not damage allowed because of insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Replanting Payments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A replant payment for wheat only is allowed as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) You comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments contained under section 13 (Replanting Payment)
of the Common Crop Insurance Policy and in any winter coverage endorsement for which you are eligible and which you
have elected;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The wheat must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at
least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The acreage must have been initially planted to spring wheat in those counties with only a spring final planting
date;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The damage must occur after the fall final planting date in those counties where both a fall and spring final planting
date are designated;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Replanting must take place not later than 25 days after the spring final planting date; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The replant wheat must be seeded at a rate that is normal for initially planted wheat (if new seed is planted at a reduced
seeding rate into a partially damaged stand of wheat, the acreage will not be eligible for a replanting payment).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) No replanting payment will be made for acreage initially planted to winter wheat in any county for which the Special
Provisions contain only a fall final planting date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In accordance with subsection 13.(c) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8), the maximum amount of
the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of 20 percent (20%) of the production guarantee or 3 bushels, multiplied
by your price election multiplied by your share.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When wheat is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, the liability for the unit
will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to your duties under section 14 of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8), if you initially discover
damage to any insured crop within 15 days of, or during harvest, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested
crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 feet wide and the entire length of each field in the unit, and
must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the
unit is completed.

11. Settlement of Claim
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are
acceptable to us for any:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided;

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested
acreage for each unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Subtracting from this the total production to count; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Multiplying this result by your share. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The total production (bushels) to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All appraised production as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Which is abandoned; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Put to another use without our consent; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess
moisture in accordance with subsection 11.(d)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to another use or you wish to abandon and no longer care
for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage
will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached, you may elect to continue to care for the crop, or
we will give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for,
representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us. The amount of production to count for such acreage
will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred.
If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal
made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production
to count. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) You elect to continue to care for the crop, we will determine the amount of production to count for the acreage using
the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Mature wheat, barley, oat, and rye production may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. Flax
production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Production will be reduced by .12 percent for each .1 percentage point of moisture in excess of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 16.0 for rye. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain, result in: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Wheat not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight, total

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Substances or conditions are present, including mycotoxins, that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration
or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided
under these crop provisions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions result in a net price for the damaged grain that is less than the local
market price of U.S. No. 2 production;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production
obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The samples are analyzed by a grain grader licensed under the authority of the United States Grain Standards Act
or the United States Warehouse Act with regard to deficiencies in quality, or by a laboratory approved by us with regard
to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health. Test weight for quality adjustment purposes may
be determined by one loss adjustor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Production of small grains that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in paragraphs 11.(d) (2) and
(3), will be reduced as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The market price of the qualifying damaged production and the local market price will be the prices on the earlier
of the date such quality adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit. The price for the qualifying
damaged production will be the market price for the local area to the extent feasible. Discounts used to establish
the net price of the damaged production will be limited to those which are usual, customary, and reasonable. Any reduction
in price due to the following factors will not be accepted:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Moisture content;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Damage due to uninsured causes; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with normal harvesting, handling, and marketing
of the grain; except, if the price of the damaged production can be increased by conditioning, we may reduce the price
of the production after it has been conditioned by the cost of conditioning but not lower than the value of the production
before conditioning. We may obtain prices from any buyer of our choice. If we obtain prices from one or more buyers located
outside your local market area, we will reduce such prices by the additional costs required to deliver the production
to those buyers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The value of the damaged or conditioned production will be divided by the local market price to determine the quality
adjustment factor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The number of bushels remaining after any reduction due to excessive moisture (the moisture-adjusted gross
bushels (if appropriate)) of the damaged or conditioned production will then be multiplied by the quality adjustment
factor to determine the net production to count.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop
on a weight basis.

12. Late Planting and Prevented Planting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In lieu of paragraph 8.(b)(2) and subsection 1.(aa) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8), insurance
will be provided for acreage planted to the insured crop during the late planting period (see subsection (c)), and
acreage you were prevented from planting (see subsection (d)). These coverages provide reduced production guarantees.
The reduced guarantees will be combined with the production guarantee for timely planted acreage for each unit. The
premium amount for late planted acreage and eligible prevented planting acreage will be the same as that for timely
planting acreage. If the amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less our subsidy) for late planting
acreage or prevented planting acreage exceeds the liability on such acreage, coverage for those acres will not be
provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid for such acreage). For example, assume you insure one
unit in which you have a 100 percent share. The unit consists of 150 acres, of which 50 acres were planted timely, 50 acres
were planted 7 days after the final planting date (late planted), and 50 acres are unplanted and eligible for prevented
planting coverage. To calculate the amount of any indemnity which may be due to you, the production guarantee for the
unit will be computed as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For timely planted acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 50 acres
planted timely;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For late planted acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by 93 percent
(0.93) and multiply the result by the 50 acres planted late; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For prevented planting acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by 50 percent
(0.50) and multiply the result by the 50 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total of the three calculations will be the production guarantee for the unit. Your premium will be based on the
result of multiplying the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 150 acres in the unit.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) You must provide written notice to us if you were prevented from planting (see subsection 1.(p)). This notice must
be given not later than three (3) days after:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The final planting date if you have unplanted acreage that may be eligible for prevented planting coverage; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The date you stop planting within the late planting period on any unit that may have acreage eligible for prevented
planting coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Late Planting:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For spring-planted wheat acreage in counties for which the Special Provisions designate a spring final planting
date, and all barley, flax, oat, and rye acreage which is planted after the final planting date but on or before 25 days
after the final planting date, the production guarantee for each acre will be reduced for each day planted after the
final planting date by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) One percent (.01) for the first through the tenth day; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Two percent (.02) for the eleventh through the twenty-fifth day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the requirements of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8),
you must report the dates the acreage is planted within the late planting period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If planting of the insured crop continues after the final planting date, or you are prevented from planting during
the late planting period, the acreage reporting date will be the later of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Five (5) days after the end of the late planting period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Prevented Planting (Including Planting After the Late Planting Period)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If you were prevented from planting the insured crop (see subsection 1.(p)), you may elect:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To plant the insured crop during the late planting period (The production guarantee for such acreage will be determined
in accordance with paragraph 12.(c)(1));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Not to plant this acreage to any crop that is intended for harvest in the same crop year (The production guarantee
for such acreage which is eligible for prevented planting coverage will be 50 percent (50%) of the production guarantee
for timely planted acres. In counties for which the Special Provisions designates a spring final planting date, the
prevented planting guarantee will be based on your approved yield for spring-planted acreage of the insured crop.
For example, if your production guarantee for timely planted acreage is 30 bushels per acre, your prevented planting
production guarantee would be equivalent to 15 bushels per acre (30 bushels multiplied by 0.50). This subparagraph
does not prohibit the preparation and care of the acreage for conservation practices, such as planting a cover crop,
as long as such crop is not intended for harvest); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) To plant the insured crop after the late planting period (The production guarantee for such acreage will be 50
percent (50%) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres. For example, if your production guarantee for
timely planted acreage is 30 bushels per acre, your prevented planting production guarantee would be equivalent
to 15 bushels per acre (30 bushels times 0.50). Production to count for such acreage will be determined in accordance
with subsections 11.(c) through (e)).

(2) In addition to the provisions under section 11 (Insurance Period), of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8)
the beginning of the insurance period for prevented coverage is the sales closing date designated in the Special Provisions
for the insured crop in the county.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Unless we agree in writing, prior to the sales closing date, the acreage to which prevented planting coverage applies
will be limited as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Eligible acreage will not exceed the greater of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The number of acres planted to the insured crop on each ASCS Farm Serial Number during the previous crop year (adjusted

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The ASCS base acreage for the insured crop reduced by any acreage reduction applicable to the farm under any program

Unless we agree in writing, prior to the sales closing date, to approve acreage exceeding this limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Acreage intended to be planted under an irrigated practice will be limited to the number of acres properly prepared
to carry out an irrigated practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A prevented planting production guarantee will not be provided for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Any acreage that does not constitute at least 20 acres or 20 percent (20%) of the acres in the unit, whichever is less;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Land for which the actuarial table does not designate a premium rate unless you submit a written request for coverage
for such acreage prior to the sales closing date for the insured crop in the county and we provide a written insurance
offer for such acreage;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Land used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered to have been left unplanted under any program
administered by the United States Department of Agriculture;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Land on which any crop, other than the insured crop, has been planted and is intended for harvest, or has been harvested
in the same crop year; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Land which planting history or conservation plans indicate would remain fallow for crop rotation purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For the purpose of determining eligible acreage for prevented planting coverage, acreage for all units will
be combined and reduced by the number of acres of the insured crop that are timely planted and late planted. For example,
assume you have 100 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage in which you have a 100 percent (100%) share. The
acreage is located in a single ASCS Farm Serial Number which you insure as two separate optional units consisting of
50 acres each. If you planted 60 acres of the insured crop on one optional unit and 40 acres of the insured crop on the second
optional unit, your prevented planting eligible acreage would be reduced to zero (i.e., 100 acres eligible for prevented
planting coverage minus 100 acres planted equals zero). If you report more acreage of the insured crop under this contract
than is eligible for prevented planting coverage, we will allocate the eligible acreage to insured units based on
the number of prevented planting acres and share you report for each unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When the ASCS Farm Serial Number covers more than one unit, or a unit consists of more than one ASCS Farm Serial Number,
the covered acres will be pro-rated based on the number of acres in each unit or ASCS Farm Serial Number that could have
been planted to the insured crop in the current crop year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In accordance with the provisions of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8),
you must report any insurable acreage you were prevented from planting. This report must be submitted on or before
the acreage reporting date for spring-planted acreage of the insured crop in counties for which the Special Provisions
designates a spring final planting date, or the acreage reporting date for fall-planted acreage of the insured crop
in counties for which the Special Provisions designates a fall final planting date only, even though you may elect
to plant the acreage after the late planting period. Any acreage you report as eligible for prevented planting coverage
which is not eligible will be deleted from prevented planting coverage.

(1) You must have a Small Grains Crop Insurance policy in force and elect to insure wheat under that policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) You may select either Option A or Option B. Failure to select either Option A or Option B means that you have rejected
both Options and this endorsement would be void. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Insurance Period. Coverage under this endorsement begins on the later of the date we accept your application for
coverage or on the fall final planting date designated in the Special Provisions. Coverage ends on the spring final
planting date designated in the Special Provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The provisions under section 14 of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8) are amended to require that
all notices of damage must be provided to us by the spring final planting date designated in the Special Provisions.

Option A (30 Percent Coverage and Acreage Release) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever any winter wheat is damaged during the insurance period (see section 3, above), and at least 20 acres or 20
percent of the acreage in the unit, whichever is less, does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent
of the production guarantee for the acreage, you may take any one of the following actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Destroy the remaining crop on such acreage. By doing so, you agree to accept an amount of production to count against
the unit production guarantee equal to 70 percent of the production guarantee for the damaged acreage, or an appraisal
determined in accordance with paragraph 11.(c)(1) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (&sect;457.101)
if such an appraisal results in a greater amount of production. This amount will be considered production to count
in determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to settle your claim as described in the provisions under
section 11. (Settlement of Claim) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (&sect;457.101). You may use such
acreage for any purpose, including planting and separately insuring any other crop. If you elect to utilize such acreage
for the production of spring wheat, you must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Plant the spring wheat in a manner which results in a clear and discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundary
between it and any remaining winter wheat; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Store or market the production from such acreage in a manner which permits us to verify the amount of spring wheat
production separately from any winter wheat production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us, the spring wheat acreage will
be considered to be a part of the original winter wheat unit. If you elected to insure the spring wheat acreage as a separate
optional unit, any premium amount for such acreage will be considered earned and payable to us. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Continue to care for the damaged crop. By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance
Policy (&sect;457.8), the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (&sect;457.101), and this Option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Replant the acreage to an appropriate variety of wheat, if it is practical, and receive a replanting payment in
accordance with the terms of section 9. (Replanting Payments) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions (&sect;457.101).
By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8), the Small Grains
Crop Insurance Provisions (&sect;457.101), and this Option, and the production guarantee for winter wheat will
remain in effect.

for the acreage, you may, at your option, take one of the following actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Continue to care for the damaged crop. By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance
Policy (&sect;457.8), the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (&sect;457.101), and this Option.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before the acreage reporting date, written contract with a brewery or business that makes or sells malt or processed
mash to a brewery, which states the quantity contracted and purchase price or method for determining such price by
the acreage reporting date. Our liability under this Option will be limited to the lesser of the number of contracted
bushels or your production guarantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All barley acreage in the county planted to an approved malting variety in which you have a share will be insured
under this Endorsement. All barley acreage of any non-malting variety will be insured under the terms of the Small

may be allowed in accordance with the Common Crop Insurance Policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Your price election will be provided by the actuarial table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In lieu of subparagraphs 11.(d)(2)(i)(B) and 11.(d)(1)(ii) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Mature malting barley production, which due to insurable causes, is not accepted by a buyer of malting barley and
will not meet the applicable standards for two-rowed or six-rowed malting barley will be adjusted by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Dividing the value per bushel for the insured malting barley by the price election for malting barley; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Multiplying the result not to exceed one (1.0) by the number of bushels of such barley. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) All grade determination must be made by a grader licensed to inspect barley under the United States Grain Standards
Act using samples obtained by a licensed sampler or our loss adjuster. Any production which is not sampled and graded

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The local market price of basic barley of the same quality as the insured malting barley, if the malting barley
does not grade better than U.S. No. 5.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Brucellosis is an infectious disease of animals and humans caused by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria of the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brucella. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its principal animal hosts_cattle, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bison, and swine_brucellosis is characterized by abortion and impaired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fertility. The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations) govern the interstate movement of cattle, bison, and swine in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to help prevent the spread of brucellosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official brucellosis tests are used to determine the brucellosis disease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status of cattle, bison, and swine. The regulations stipulate that certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cattle, bison, and swine must, among other requirements, test negative to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official brucellosis test prior to interstate movement. Official brucellosis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests are also used to determine eligibility for indemnity payments for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals destroyed because of brucellosis. In &sect;78.1 of the regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of official test lists those tests that have been designated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official tests for determining the brucellosis disease status of cattle, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bison, and swine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 27, 1993, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR

50290&hyph;50291, Docket No. 93&hyph;044&hyph;1) a proposal to amend the regulations by

determining the brucellosis disease status of test-eligible cattle and bison. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period ending October 27, 1993. We received one comment by that date, from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
veterinary medical association. The commenter supported our proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule without change.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule change will not add any costs for agricultural producers. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will, however, benefit farmers and ranchers who, without access to this or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other available diagnostic tests, quarantine or destroy animals on the basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ``false positive'' reactions to presumptive tests. We estimate that between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
200 and 300 animals are unnecessarily slaughtered or quarantined each year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after having falsely tested positive on presumptive tests. These losses could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be prevented by the use of diagnostic tests. The addition of the D-Tec

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranchers if they opt to use it. While losses resulting from false positives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit all those entities that avail themselves of the D-Tec

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are amending the animal byproduct importation regulations to allow hoofs that have been disinfected in their country
of origin to be imported into the United States without further processing. Currently, certain hoofs imported into
the United States must be consigned from the port of first arrival to an approved establishment having facilities
for their disinfection. We have determined, however, that hoofs that have been adequately disinfected in their country
of origin may be imported into the United States without risk of introducing disease. This change in the regulations
will give importers of hoofs that require disinfection a choice between importing disinfected hoofs and importing
unprocessed hoofs for disinfection in the United States.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 95 (referred to below as ``the regulations'') contain restrictions on the importation
into the United States of certain animal byproducts and hay and straw in order to prevent the introduction of certain
animal diseases. Among the regulated animal byproducts are animal hoofs, which, along with bones and horns, may be
imported subject to the restrictions contained in &sect;&sect;95.11 and 95.12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 13, 1993, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 37669&hyph;37670, Docket No. 92&hyph;135&hyph;1) a proposal to amend the regulations to allow hoofs that
have been disinfected in their country of origin, using one of five approved disinfection methods specified in the
proposed rule, to be imported into the United States without additional treatment. We proposed to require that the
hoofs be accompanied by a certificate issued by the national government of the country of origin and signed by an official
veterinary inspector of that country stating that the hoofs have been disinfected and describing the manner in which
the disinfection was accomplished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending September 13, 1993. We received
one comment by that date, from a veterinary medical association. The comment fully supported our proposed rule.

Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as

Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This rule removes restrictions on the importation of hoofs by allowing hoofs that have been processed in their country
of origin to be imported into the United States without further processing. We have determined that approximately
2 weeks are needed to ensure that Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service personnel at ports of entry receive official
notice of this change in the regulations. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service has determined that this rule should be made effective 15 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the Department,
we have determined that this rule: (1) Will have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) will not adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (3) will not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (4) will not alter the budgetary impact of
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) will not
raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth
in Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have required certain hoofs imported into the United States to be consigned directly from the port of entry to an
approved establishment that has facilities for their disinfection. This rule will allow hoofs to be imported into
the United States without further processing if the hoofs have been disinfected using an approved method in their
country of origin. We believe that adding this option will have little or no economic impact on U.S. importers of hoofs
because it will not significantly decrease their cost of doing business. The primary impact on these importers will
be the added convenience of having two importation options from which to choose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary use of disinfected hoofs appears to be in the production of dog chews, but that industry is still in its infancy
and is rather small in terms of production and numbers of producers. Based on information available to the Department,
we estimate that there are currently fewer than 10 importers of hoofs and approximately 6 producers of dog chews made
from hoofs. Using the Small Business Administration's size criteria of fewer than 100 employees, all of these businesses
would be considered small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that a few of these businesses receive hoofs from both foreign and domestic sources. Because the industry
is small and relatively new, however, there are no records available concerning the number of hoofs imported into
the United States or the levels of dog chew production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facilities in which hoofs are disinfected handle a variety of items, with hoofs making up only a small percentage
of the total volume of products processed. Therefore, we anticipate that allowing hoofs to be processed in their country
of origin will have little, if any, economic impact on domestic processors in terms of lost volume and revenue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes. The CAA advises that reports
have been received of failure of the main landing gear (MLG) wheel bearings on Model ATP airplanes. Investigations
are under way to determine the cause of these failures. This condition, if not corrected, could result in detachment
of a MLG wheel from the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;32&hyph;48, Revision 1, dated January 28, 1994, that describes
procedures for performing daily and pre-flight detailed visual inspections to detect damage or discoloration of
the main wheel hub caps and of the outer side of the inflation valve side hubs on the MLG wheels. (This service bulletin
references Dunlop Service Bulletin AHA 1663&hyph;32&hyph;1088, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994, as the appropriate
source of service information.) The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness
Directive 007&hyph;12&hyph;93, dated December 22, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these
airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the MLG wheel bearings, which
could result in detachment of the MLG wheel from the airplane. This AD requires daily and pre-flight detailed visual
inspections to detect damage or discoloration of the main wheel hub caps and of the outer side of the inflation valve
side hubs on the MLG wheels. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the Jetstream service bulletin
described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD also requires replacement of the entire MLG wheel assembly and bearings with a serviceable wheel assembly
and bearings, if any damage or discoloration is detected during any inspection. The replacement is required to be
accomplished in accordance with the airplane maintenance manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators should note that, although Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;32&hyph;48, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revision 1, dated January 28, 1994, specifies that certain pilots may perform both the daily and pre-flight inspections,
it is the FAA's determination that both inspections must be performed by appropriately certificated maintenance
personnel, as specified in &sect;43.3 of the FAR (14 CFR 43.3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications

amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions
is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking
action would be needed.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;16&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), by eliminating
the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) certification requirements for exports and reexports of replacement parts
and equipment under General License GLR to Country Groups Q, T, V, W, and Y. These reporting requirements were originally
imposed as a tracking system to help determine how well the replacement provisions of General License GLR were working.
BXA has determined that placing the symbol GLR on the SED is in itself a certification that the conditions of the general
license are understood and that the exporter will comply with the terms of the general license. However, the removal
of the certification requirement does not relieve the exporter of any recordkeeping obligations or other export
clearance provisions contained in the EAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule also eliminates the reporting requirement regarding servicing commodities imported from Country Groups
Q, W, or Y and eliminates the reporting requirements regarding certain reexports of one-for-one replacements and
replacement equipment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Exporters are reminded that listing General License GLR on the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) and the presentation
of such a SED to the U.S. Government under the clearance procedures of part 786 constitutes a declaration that the export
is authorized under General License GLR and that the exporter is committed to the terms and conditions of the one-for-one
replacement authority of General License GLR, including, but not limited to, the duty to destroy abroad or return
the part to be replaced.

Rulemaking Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This rule involves a collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694&hyph;0018 and 0694&hyph;0047. This
rule will reduce the reporting burden on the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves
a foreign and military affairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the Export Administration Act (EAA)
does not require that this rule be published in proposed form because this rule does not impose a new control. No other
law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, it is issued in final form. However, comments from the public are always welcome. Comments should be
submitted to Patricia Muldonian, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department
of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is issuing in final form amendments to the regulations issued under
the Government Securities Act of 1986, as amended (the ``Government Securities Act'' or ``GSA''). The amendments
implement a buy-in requirement for mortgage-backed securities that are in a fail to receive status for more than 60
calendar days; and all government securities that are needed to complete a customer sell order (other than a short
sale) if the securities have not been received from the customer within 30 calendar days after the settlement date
for all government securities except mortgage-backed securities, or 60 calendar days after the settlement date
for mortgage-backed securities. The final rule adopts without substantive change the buy-in requirements for mortgage-backed
securities in a fail to receive status that were prescribed in the proposed rules published for comment on April 17,
1991. However, the time frames for buy-ins of customer sell orders have been revised in the final rule in response to
comments received on the proposed rules. These requirements apply to all entities that are required to register or
provide notice of their status as government securities brokers and dealers.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The GSA regulations currently require a government securities broker or dealer to take prompt steps to obtain possession
or control of customers' fully paid or excess margin securities that have been in a fail to receive status for more than
30 calendar days through a buy-in procedure or otherwise. However, mortgage-backed securities are not subject to
this buy-in requirement since the Department suspended the application of this rule to such securities in the GSA
regulations that were issued in July 1987.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, the current GSA regulations do not impose a buy-in requirement for customer sell orders where the government
securities broker or dealer has not obtained the securities from its customer. A temporary rule imposing such a requirement
on registered government securities brokers and dealers was suspended in the July 1987 GSA regulations issued by
the Department.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 17, 1991, the Department proposed for comment amendments to sections 403.1, 403.4, and 403.5 of the GSA regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendments prescribed buy-in requirements for: (i) Mortgage-backed securities in a fail to receive
status for more than 60 calendar days, and (ii) customer sell orders (other than short sales) in which the securities
were not received from the customer within ten business days after the settlement date.

 See 56 FR 15529 (April 17, 1991). The rule changes to these three sections of the GSA regulations would make the buy-in
requirements applicable to all classes of government securities brokers and dealers that were required to register
or file notice pursuant to section 15C(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o&hyph;5(a)(1)).
Section 403.1 would apply to registered brokers and dealers that were required to file notice as government securities
brokers and dealers with the Securities and Exchange Commission; section 403.4 would apply to registered government
securities brokers and dealers (i.e., those entities that were required to register with the SEC); and section 403.5
would apply to financial institutions that were required to file notice as government securities brokers and dealers
with their respective appropriate regulatory agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule was intended to subject mortgage-backed securities to a 60 calendar day buy-in requirement, rather
than the 30 calendar days applicable to other government securities due to the unique nature of the mortgage-backed
market, particularly the lengthy settlement cycle. The reader is referred to the preamble to the proposed rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for a more detailed discussion of the Department's reasons for adopting a 60 calendar day time frame for buy-ins of
mortgage-backed securities. The proposed rulemaking also included buy-in rules for customer sell orders that would
apply to all government securities brokers and dealers, including financial institutions. Specifically, the provisions
proposed that if a government securities broker or dealer executes a customer sell order (other than a short sale)
and the broker or dealer has not obtained the securities from the customer within ten business days after the settlement
date, then the broker or dealer would be required to close out the transaction with the customer by purchasing securities
of like kind and quantity. The Department specifically requested comments concerning the appropriateness of the
ten-day time frame.

Treasury did not issue these rules in final form prior to the expiration of its rulemaking authority on October 1, 1991.
Treasury's authority under the GSA was permanently reauthorized on December 17, 1993, hence the long delay in finalizing
these rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is now adopting without significant change amendments to paragraphs 403.1, 403.4(g) and 403.5(c)(1)(iii)
that were proposed in April 1991. These provisions would require all government securities brokers and dealers that
are required to register or file notice pursuant to 15C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act to take prompt steps to obtain possession
or control of mortgage-backed securities that are in a fail to receive status for more than 60 calendar days through
a buy-in procedure or otherwise.

As discussed in more detail in the preamble to the proposed rules, the Department is adopting a longer buy-in time frame
for fails to receive for mortgage-backed securities than the 30-calendar day time frame in place for other government
securities. This longer time period is appropriate given the normally longer settlement cycle for mortgage-backed
securities (which is often as long as 30 days),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 the complexities of these instruments and the scarcity in the market of specified pools. To avoid abnormal settlements,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Department reiterates that any buy-in accomplished pursuant to these rules would be allowed to settle on the next
regularly scheduled settlement date for that particular class or pool of mortgage-backed securities.

The PSA has developed a system to standardize the settlement process for mortgage-backed securities. See Public
Securities Association, ``Uniform Practices for the Clearance and Settlement of Mortgage-Backed Securities and
Other Related Securities'' at 15&hyph;1 (1988). This system has proven successful in alleviating operational workloads
during the heaviest settlement periods, which has contributed to a reduction in the high fail rates for mortgage-backed
securities.

A settlement date other than the regularly scheduled settlement date can be requested, however, the buyer pays a premium

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department understands that the PSA will implement buy-in procedures for mortgage-backed securities similar
to those in place for other government securities. We believe that reliance on procedures that are already familiar
to the broker-dealers should facilitate the implementation of this rule and view efforts to standardize the operational
procedures as a positive step.

B. Buy-Ins for Customer Sell Orders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's proposed rules included a requirement to buy-in customer sell orders (other than a short sale) in
cases where the government securities broker or dealer had not obtained the securities from the customer within ten
business days after the settlement date. For registered government securities brokers and dealers the Department
was proposing to add paragraph 403.4(l) which incorporated by reference paragraph (m) of SEC Rule 15c3&hyph;3 (17
CFR 240.15c3&hyph;3(m)), with one modification pertaining to the definition of a short sale.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A companion buy-in rule for customer sell orders that would apply to financial institutions that are required to file
notice as government securities brokers and dealers was also proposed in April 1991 by adding new paragraph 403.5(g)
to the GSA regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its comment letter, the PSA stated that the ten-day buy-in rule for customer sell orders should not be adopted because
it has minimal customer protection benefits. The PSA noted that improvements in the settlement processes and the
fact that most Treasury, agency and government mortgage-backed securities are now in book-entry form have resulted
in increased deliveries and fewer overall fails. For those few fails that may still occur, the PSA stated that ``[b]roker-dealers
have business incentives to clean up fails to limit their market exposure.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For mortgage-backed securities, the ten-day buy-in time frame would be problematic since it would require delivery
of securities outside of the regularly scheduled settlement cycles. The PSA suggested that, if Treasury believes
a buy-in rule for customer sell orders must be adopted, the time frame should be consistent with the applicable buy-in
time frames for fails to receive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department continues to believe that buy-in rules for customer sell orders are needed to strengthen customer
protection because a customer's failure to deliver a security to an executing broker or dealer could result in that
broker's or dealer's failure to deliver to another counterparty. Further, these rules will prevent customers from
taking advantage of market fluctuations by refusing to deliver a security to a broker or dealer when the price rises
after a sell order has been executed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments made by the PSA, the Department is revising the buy-in time frame for customer sell orders
in new paragraphs 403.4(l) and paragraph 403.5(g), applicable to registered government securities brokers-dealers
and financial institution government securities broker-dealers, respectively, from ten business days to 30 calendar
days for all government securities, except mortgage-backed securities, and to 60 calendar days for all government
mortgage-backed securities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These time frames are consistent with the buy-in requirements for fails to receive addressed above. The Department
also modified the customer sell order rules to permit the use of alternatives other than purchasing securities (e.g.,
securities may be borrowed, substituted or bought back) in closing out orders. Again, this is consistent with the
buy-in rules for fails to receive.

The Department is also adopting without change, the amendments to section 403.1, which requires registered broker-dealers
to comply with paragraph 403.4(l). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The buy-in rules for customer sell orders continue to provide an exemption for short sales, which are the primary cause
for non-deliveries. This should significantly reduce the number of fails subject to these requirements. Similar
to buy-ins of mortgage-backed securities that are in a fail to receive status, broker-dealers will be allowed to effect
buy-ins for customer sell orders of mortgage-backed securities at the next regularly scheduled settlement cycle.

 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 10093 (April 10, 1973), 38 FR 12103 (May 9, 1973). It is the Department's understanding
that SEC staff intends to recommend to the Commission a proposal to lift the suspension of paragraph (m) of Rule 15c3&hyph;3
with respect to exempted securities and amend the provision in a manner that would conform with Treasury's final rule
in paragraph 403.4(l) as it relates to government and mortgage-backed securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Department is also adopting without change redesignated paragraph 403.5(h), which will now grant the
appropriate regulatory agencies for financial institutions the authority to extend the 30- and 60-calendar day
time frame for buy-ins of customer sell orders if a financial institution broker-dealer requests an extension. No
comments were received on this provision.

C. Effective Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rules become effective April 29, 1994. This will provide sufficient time for all government securities
brokers and dealers to become acquainted with the new requirements and to implement operating procedures. Additionally,
the lead time will enable the PSA to finalize and distribute buy-in procedures it is developing for the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its comment letter, the PSA requested that the Treasury's buy-in rules be enacted contemporaneously with the Commission's
amendments to Rule 15c3&hyph;3(d)(2) and (m). Since Treasury's rules apply to all government securities brokers
and dealers, and given the Department's understanding that the buy-in rules to be proposed by the Commission will
conform to those adopted herein, the Department believes that there is no compelling reason to defer implementation
until the Commission acts.

III. Special Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that this action does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes
of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, it was not subject to review under the Executive
Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the proposed rules, the Department certified that these amendments would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. In reviewing the final rules being adopted herein
and after considering the comments received on the proposed rules, the Department has concluded that there is no reason
to alter the previous certification that these rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since these final rules contain no new collections of information, the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act
(44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) are inapplicable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule exempts a new system of records entitled ``Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' from compliance
with the applicable provisions of the Privacy Act. This additional exemption is necessary because on July 12, 1993,
the Department created a new system of records entitled ``HUD/PIH&hyph;1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files''
to add to the Privacy Act system of records.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except for the Office of Inspector General, the Department's implementation of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) is
set forth in 24 CFR part 16. (The implementation of the Privacy Act for the Office of Inspector General appears in 24
CFR part 2003). The implementation of the Privacy Act includes the publication of a system of records which are exempt
from certain requirements of the Privacy Act, as determined by the Secretary under the specific exemption authority
of the Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k). The specific exemption provision of the Privacy Act authorizes exemption for systems
of records from many of the notice and access requirements of the Privacy Act, but does not affect the applicability
of the remaining Privacy Act requirements. The Department's specific exemptions appear at 24 CFR 16.15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment of a new system of records on July 12, 1993 (58 FR 37600), entitled ``HUD/PIH&hyph;1. Tenant Eligibility
Verification Files,'' and this rule are necessary as a result of the recent transfer of computer matching/tenant
eligibility verification functions from the Office of Inspector General to the Assistant Secretary for Public and
Indian Housing. (The transfer affects only housing assistance programs administered by the Assistant Secretary
for Public and Indian Housing.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tenant records and other records referenced in the new ``Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' system of records
notice were previously included in the ``Investigative Files of the Office of the Inspector General'' (HUD/OIG&hyph;1,
see 57 FR 25070). The Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing will be adding records to the final new system
based on computer matching results and verification of those results with tenant case files and records supplied
by Federal agencies and private employers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also makes changes to &sect;16.15 to clarify the scope of the exemptions applicable to the Assistant
Secretary for Public and Indian Housing's system of records entitled ``Tenant Eligibility Verification Files,''
and provides reasons for the exemptions from particular subsections of the Privacy Act that are more detailed than
those currently found at 24 CFR 16.15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Discussion of Public Comments From Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 12, 1993 (58 FR 37598), the Department published a proposed rule which would exempt the new system of records
entitled ``Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' from compliance with applicable provisions of the Privacy
Act. The Department received one public comment from a public housing agency in response to this proposed rule. The
commenter stressed the need to protect a tenant's privacy, and urged strenuous penalties to prevent misuse of the
new system of records. The Department agrees that it is extremely important to prevent the misuse of confidential
material concerning a tenant. However, the Department does not believe any changes to the final rule are necessary
because both the Privacy Act and the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 provide sufficient safeguards
to protect against the unlawful disclosure of material concerning a tenant from this Privacy Act system of records.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures in this document are determined not to have the potential of having a
significant impact on the quality of the human environment, and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Accordingly, a Finding of No Significant Impact is
not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed and approved this
rule, and in so doing certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities because the rule only affects the way the Department implements the Privacy Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Executive Order 12612, Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the order. Specifically,
the requirements of this rule are directed to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and do not impinge upon
the relationship between the Federal Government and State and local governments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

D. Executive Order 12606, The Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this final rule does not have potential for significant impact
on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No
significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies
and programs relate to family concerns.

This final rule was listed as item no. 1444 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October

(c) The system of records entitled ``HUD/PIH&hyph;1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' consists in part
of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes. Relevant records will be used by appropriate Federal,
state or local agencies charged with the responsibility for investigating or prosecuting violations of law. Therefore,
to the extent that information in the system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(2), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsections of the Privacy Act, for the reasons
stated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) From subsection (c)(3) because release of an accounting of disclosures to an individual who may be the subject
of an investigation could reveal the nature and scope of the investigation and could result in the altering or destruction
of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, and other evasive actions that could impede or compromise the investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) From subsection (d)(1) because release of the records to an individual who may become or has become the subject
of an investigation could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, constitute an unwarranted
invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, reveal the identity of confidential sources, or reveal sensitive
investigative techniques and procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) From subsection (d)(2) because amendment or correction of the records could interfere with pending or prospective
law enforcement proceedings, or could impose an impossible administrative and investigative burden by requiring
the office that maintains the records to continuously retrograde its verifications of tenant eligibility attempting
to resolve questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine relevance or necessity of information in pre-investigative early stages. The value of such information
is a question of judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be evaluated
and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to an investigation. In addition, the Assistant Secretary for Public and
Indian Housing, or investigators, may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those within
the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the Assistant Secretary for Public and
Indian Housing, or investigators, should retain this information because it may aid in establishing patterns of
unlawful activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining the evidence, information
may be provided which relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of the inquiry or investigation but which may
be pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be identified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The system of records entitled ``HUD/PIH&hyph;1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' consists in part
of material that may be used for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal
civilian employment or Federal contracts, the release of which would reveal the identity of a source who furnished
information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.
Therefore, to the extent that information in this system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(5) of the Privacy
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsection of the Privacy Act,
for the reasons stated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) From subsection (d)(1) because release would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the
Government under an express promise of confidentiality. Revealing the identity of a confidential source could impede
future cooperation by sources, and could result in harassment or harm to such sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule establishes procedures for public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities (HAs) to follow
to permit HAs to retain a portion of certain section 8 fraud recoveries from tenants and owners for use in section 8 programs.
Section 129 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 expands HA retention of section 8 fraud recoveries
to include recoveries obtained through administrative repayment agreements, as well as litigation (including
settlement of a lawsuit) or a court-ordered restitution. This rule applies to the section 8 rental certificate, rental
voucher, moderate rehabilitation programs, and private owner/HA new construction and substantial rehabilitation
projects subject to an Annual Contributions Contract.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some tenants receiving section 8 assistance submit false statements which underreport income to obtain excessive
housing assistance. Similarly, some owners also commit fraud in order to receive section 8 rental assistance payments
to which they are not entitled. Examples of owner fraud include billing for vacant dwelling units, charging more rent
for assisted units than unassisted units in the same building, receiving sidepayments from assisted tenants, and
knowingly admitting ineligible tenants into section 8 substantial rehabilitation and new construction projects.
Through various methods, such as direct observation, informants, investigative action and computer matches, HAs
discover that tenants and owners have committed fraud in order to receive either benefits or payments for which they
were not entitled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1981, Congress enacted legislation aimed at stemming this fraud and abuse. Section 326(d)(1) of the Housing and
Community Development Amendments of 1981 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;35; hereafter referred to as ``1981 HCD Act'') allowed
HAs to retain ``out of judgments obtained by them in recovering amounts wrongfully paid as a result of fraud and abuse''
a portion of the fraud recoveries to encourage HAs to recover amounts overpaid as a result of such fraud and abuse. On
August 20, 1986 (51 FR 29633), the Department published a final rule implementing section 326(d)(1) of the 1981 HCD
Amendments. In the final rule, HUD construed the term ``judgments'' to allow HAs to retain amounts recovered by means
of litigation, including a settlement of litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, most section 8 fraud recoveries result from administrative repayment agreements between the HA and the
families, or between the HA and the owner. As such, nearly all tenant and owner fraud recoveries have gone to HUD, and
HAs have had little monetary incentive to identify tenant and owner fraud and pursue repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 129 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992;
hereafter referred to as ``1992 HCD Act''), allows HAs to retain a portion of rental assistance fraud recoveries obtained
through litigation, court-ordered restitutions, and administrative repayment agreements pursuant to an administrative
grievance procedure except in cases where HUD is the principal party initiating or sustaining the recovery action.
By allowing HAs to retain a portion of the monies recovered under administrative repayment agreements, the Act provides
an additional incentive for HAs to aggressively pursue cases of suspected fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Act and this regulation, an HA can retain the greater of: (1) 50 percent of the amount collected or (2) the actual,
reasonable, and necessary expenses related to the collection, including the cost of investigation, legal fees and
collection fees. The recoveries may be obtained through litigation (including settlement of a lawsuit), a court-ordered
restitution, or an administrative repayment agreement pursuant to an administrative grievance procedure. The
rule applies to the Section 8 Rental Certificate, Rental Voucher, Moderate Rehabilitation Programs and private
owner/HA new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects subject to an Annual Contributions Contract
(ACC) between HUD and an HA.

Finally, in August of 1986, the Department added a final rule implementing section 326(d)(1) of the 1981 HCD Amendments
as a new part 892. This final rule transfers the requirements of 892 to a new part 792, and removes part 892. The rule also
changes the reference from public housing agency (PHA) to housing agency (HA) to recognize definitional changes
resulting from the Indian Housing Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;358).

II. Other Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to HUD administrative procedures
and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Executive Order 12612, Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. Specifically, the rule increases the amount a housing agency may recover
in fraud and abuse cases. As such, the rule will not impinge on the relationship between the Federal and state and local
governments, and the rule is not subject to review under the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Executive Order 12606, the Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result
from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this
rule, and in so doing certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities, because the number of recoveries by housing agencies is expected to be small and so the number of small
public housing agencies affected will be small. In any event, the effect on small entities is expected to be positive
rather than negative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

E. Paperwork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The changes made by this final rule to the regulatory text in 24 CFR part 892, which now appears as 24 CFR part 792, will
not add any additional information collection burden than that already approved by the Office of Management and Burden
under the Paperwork Reduction Act and assigned OMB approval number 2577&hyph;0053.

F. Regulatory Agenda 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule was listed as item no. 1655 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25,
1993 (58 FR 56402, 56453) in accordance with Executive Order 12991 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Justification for Final Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes rules for public comment before their issuance for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 provides exceptions from that general rule where
the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest'' (24 CFR 10.1).
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment,
in that prior public procedure is unnecessary because the changes being made to part 892, which now appears as part
792, merely implement statutory amendments that do not involve the exercise of any discretion by the Department.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this part is to encourage public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities (HAs) to investigate
and pursue instances of tenant and owner fraud and abuse in the operation of the section 8 housing assistance payments
programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This part applies to an HA acting as a contract administrator under an annual contributions contract with HUD in
any section 8 housing assistance payments program. To be eligible to retain section 8 tenant or owner fraud recoveries,
the HA must be the principal party initiating or sustaining an action to recover amounts from families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) This part applies only to those instances when a tenant or owner committed fraud, and the fraud recoveries are obtained
through litigation brought by the HA (including settlement of the lawsuit), a court-ordered restitution pursuant
to a criminal proceeding, or an administrative repayment agreement with the family or owner as a result of an HA administrative
grievance procedure pursuant to, or incorporating the requirements of, &sect;882.216 or 887.405. This part does
not apply to cases of owner fraud in HA-owned or controlled units, or where incorrect payments were made or benefits
received because of calculation errors instead of willful fraudulent activities.

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending the regulations that govern its program to provide for the transportation
of claimants and beneficiaries to VA health care facilities. The amendments will correct an inadvertent error made
when the Department last promulgated regulations pertaining to this program in 1991. This amendment will delete
an inaccurate reference to beneficiaries who are in receipt of pension as not subject to a travel deductable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 21, 1991, the Department of Veterans Affairs amended its regulations governing the beneficiary travel
program to implement changes in law made by Public Law 100&hyph;322. Generally, that law authorized the Government
to pay for travel for certain categories of veterans but imposed a ``deductible'' on the amount of the benefit. Other
categories of veterans could receive travel benefits without having to pay the deductible. The 1991 amendments to
the implementing regulations correctly provided that a veteran in receipt of pension benefits was required to pay
a deductible. (See: 38 CFR 17.100(b)(3)). However, in another place, the same regulation inadvertently provided
that a veteran in receipt of VA pension benefits could receive transportation expenses without being subject to the
deductible. (See: 38 CFR 17.100(c)(3)). The latter provision is inconsistent with the law, and this amendment will
correct that error.

The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs hereby certifies that this regulation will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5
U.S.C. 601&hyph;612.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation concerned the provision of beneficiary travel to a specified category of eligible veterans. No paperwork,
administrative or other regulatory burdens are imposed upon small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document extends tolerances for the residues of the seven synthetic pyrethroids_permethrin, cypermethrin,
fenvalerate/esfenvalerate, tralomethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin (collectively referred
to as the synthetic pyrethroids)_in or on certain raw agricultural commodities. This rule to extend the effective
date for tolerances for maximum permissible levels of residues of these synthetic pyrethroids in or on these commodities
was requested by FMC Corp. (FMC), Zeneca Ag Products, E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet
Co., and Miles, Inc. (collectively called the industry's Pyrethroid Working Group (PWG)).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54093), EPA issued a proposed rule to amend 40 CFR part 180 by extending to November 15, 1994,
tolerances for the residues of the seven synthetic pyrethroids in or on certain commodities. The Pyrethroid Working
Group had requested the extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in conjunction with the extension request and in previous extensions for the synthetic pyrethroids
have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes
that the tolerance extensions will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance extensions are established
as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

Summary of Report and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In this Report and Order the Commission allocates 33 MHz of spectrum, the 1610&hyph;1626.5 and 2483.5&hyph;2500
MHz bands, for the mobile-satellite service (MSS). A total of 16.5 MHz, 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz, is provided for primary
space-to-Earth (uplink) operations and 16.5 MHz, 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz, is provided for primary Earth-to-space
(downlink) operations. Also, 12.7 MHz, 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz, is allocated for secondary MSS space-to-Earth
(downlink) operations. In addition, the Commission elevates the radio astronomy service allocation in the 1610.6&hyph;1613.8
MHz band from secondary to co-primary status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The 1610&hyph;1626.5 and 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz bands currently are allocated to a number of other services. The
radiodetermination satellite service (RDSS), is allocated in these bands on a primary basis but only interim RDSS
systems have been authorized.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Newcomb Communications, Inc., 8 FCC Rcd 3631 (1993); and letter to Counsel, Mobile Data Communications, Inc. from
Chief, Domestic Facilities Division (August 19, 1993). Currently, the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band is allocated to
the aeronautical radionavigation service on a co-primary basis, and the 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz segment of this
band also is allocated to the radio astronomy service (RAS) on a secondary basis. Frequencies adjacent to the 1610&hyph;1626.5
MHz band are allocated to aeronautical radionavigation satellite and maritime mobile satellite services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band is authorized for co-primary use by the broadcast auxiliary service, the terrestrial
fixed service, and the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) service. Additionally, the frequencies adjacent
to this band are allocated on a primary basis to the instructional television fixed service (ITFS), the multi-channel
multi-point distribution service (MMDS), fixed services, mobile services and for industrial, scientific, and
medical (ISM) equipment, and to the radiolocation service on a secondary basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On August 5, 1992, we proposed to allocate these bands to the mobile-satellite service systems, shared on a co-primary
basis with the RDSS. See 57 FR 43434 (September 21, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Based on the record in this proceeding, we find that there is substantial interest in using both LEO and GEO technologies
to provide new voice and data MSS services in the subject bands. As we indicated in the Notice, MSS LEO systems will offer
significant new benefits to both domestic and international communications users. MSS LEO systems potentially
can provide a universally available world-wide cellular-like radiotelephone service offering voice, data, and
facsimile service. In addition, radiolocation and radionavigation applications also can be provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Some of the new applications envisioned include: (1) personal locator services that could be used to locate accident
victims or persons stranded because of weather or injury; (2) fleet management and tracking services that would permit
more efficient shipping and transportation of goods, including the tracking of hazardous wastes and material; (3)
public safety services that would allow state and local governments to use MSS to extend health and emergency services
to rural and remote areas currently unserved by traditional communications facilities; and (4) International Services
that would permit global MSS and make modern telephone communications available to remote and underserved areas
throughout the world.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Further, the Commission determined that although the specific method for sharing among systems remains to be determined,
based on the record, bi-directional operations in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band is feasible, and accordingly
the Commission is providing for a secondary allocation for space-to-Earth operations in this band.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Commission also concluded that MSS operations in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 and 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz bands should
be subject to the e.i.r.p. and power flux density levels set forth in the international Radio Regulations. In addition,
such MSS operations will be subject to the coordination and notification procedures set forth in Resolution 46.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. We continue to believe that, at least initially, the existing FSS bands are sufficient to accommodate MSS feeder
links. We note that there may be difficulties in using FSS bands that generally are congested with significant numbers
of geostationary fixed-satellite systems (GEO FSS). Consequently, because of the significant coordination difficulties
arising from the global nature of LEO operations, MSS LEO feeder links would need to operate in FSS frequency bands
that are not heavily used by GEO FSS systems. We are also including the inter-satellite service bands at 24.45&hyph;24.65
and 24.65&hyph;24.75 GHz and the already allocated inter-satellite service band at 22.55&hyph;23 GHz in the United
States Table of Frequency Allocations for non-government use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In view of the important health issues involved, the fact that no general manufacture of consumer equipment for
MSS in these bands has yet begun, and our intent to provide for the expeditious initiation of the services for which
this spectrum is being allocated, we believe the ANSI/IEEE guidelines (IEEE C95.1&hyph;1991) should be used when
evaluating the potential for harm to public health from exposure to RF emissions of MSS user devices. If we modify the
ANSI/IEEE guidelines in ET Docket No. 92&hyph;62, those guidelines will be applied to MSS equipment. We will require
that all hand-held devices comply with the ANSI/IEEE specifications for ``uncontrolled'' environments because
the new MSS service as envisioned would include consumer use that would be within the ``uncontrolled'' definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Further, in the Notice and Tentative Decision, 57 FR 43434, September 21, 1992 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
supra, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we dismissed a petition for rule making filed by CELSAT to use the RDSS frequency band for a hybrid satellite and terrestrial
ground personal communications service (PCS). CELSAT had an alternative request for spectrum in the 2120&hyph;2129
and 2410&hyph;2428 MHz bands, including a pioneer's preference request which remains pending. On October 5, 1992,
CELSAT filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the Commission's Notice and Tentative Decision in which it argues
that the Commission incorrectly dismissed its proposed spectrum allocation because the terrestrial element of
its proposal was incompatible with WARC&hyph;92. TRW filed a petition to dismiss the CELSAT Petition for Reconsideration.
The Commission grants TRW's petition but accepts CELSAT's petition as late filed comments. The Commission continues
to believe that for the purpose of international coordination it is important that our domestic allocation be compatible
with the WARC&hyph;92 spectrum allocation. Thus we continue to hold that terrestrial operations in these bands is
inappropriate. For this reason, we accept CELSAT's Petition for Reconsideration as a comment in this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. In the Notice and Tentative Decision we noted that the proposal was analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 and found to contain no new or modified form, information collection and/or record keeping, labeling,
disclosure, or record retention requirements, and will not increase or decrease burden hours imposed on the public.
No comments were received regarding the Paperwork Reduction Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Further, in the Notice and Tentative Decision we invited comments on the impact of the proposed allocation in accordance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. No comments were received in response to our analysis of this allocation
as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

731E_The use of the band 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz by the mobile-satellite service (Earth-to-space) and by the radiodetermination-satellite
service (Earth-to-space) is subject to the application of the coordination and notification procedures set forth
in Resolution 46 (WARC&hyph;92). A mobile earth station operating in either of the services in this band shall not
produce an e.i.r.p. density in excess of ^15 dB (W/4 kHz) in the part of the band used by systems operating in accordance
with the provisions of No. 732, unless otherwise agreed by the affected administrations. In the part of the band where
such systems are not operating, a value of ^3 dB (W/4 kHz) is applicable. Stations of the mobile-satellite service
shall not cause harmful interference to, or claim protection from, stations in the aeronautical radionavigation
service, stations operating in accordance with the provisions of No. 732 and stations in the fixed service operating
in accordance with the provisions of No. 730.

Synopsis of Report and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This Report and Order amends part 32 to incorporate the new accounting procedures for income taxes prescribed in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS&hyph;109) and it also establishes new accounts to properly
implement those procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This Report and Order adds three new accounts to the Uniform System of Accounts to incorporate the requirements
of SFAS&hyph;109 into part 32. The new accounts are Account 1437, Deferred Tax Regulatory Asset; Account 4341, Net
Deferred Tax Liability Adjustments; and Account 4361, Deferred Tax Regulatory Liability. These new accounts will
reflect the adjustments to existing carrier deferred tax balances that are necessary as a result of adopting SFAS&hyph;109.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The type of SFAS&hyph;109 adjustments that will be shown in the above accounts relate to changes in tax rates, recording
tax liabilities for items that were previously accounted for under the flow through method, and recording taxes on
items that were formerly considered permanent differences by the accounting profession.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Report and Order will be effective six months after it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, the Report and Order permits carriers to adopt SFAS&hyph;109 for federal accounting purposes on January
1, 1993 if the carriers so desire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Finally, the new accounts that are established in the Report and Order will be excluded from interstate rate base
and revenue requirement determinations. This insures that the adoption of SFAS&hyph;109 for federal accounting
purposes will not increase or decrease the interstate revenue requirement.

Comprehensive interperiod tax allocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Companies shall apply interperiod tax allocation (tax normalization) to all book/tax temporary differences
which would be considered material for published financial report purposes. Furthermore, companies shall also
apply interperiod tax allocation if any item or group of similar items when aggregated would yield debit or credit
entries which exceed or would exceed 5 percent of the gross deferred income tax expense debits or credits during any
calendar year over the life of the temporary difference. The tax effects of book/tax temporary differences shall
be normalized and the deferrals shall be included in the following accounts:

(c) Subsidiary records shall be used to reduce the deferred tax assets contained in the accounts specified in paragraph
(a) of this section when it is likely that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The amount
recorded in the subsidiary record should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is likely
to be realized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The records supporting the activity in the deferred income tax accounts shall be maintained in sufficient detail
to identify the nature of the specific temporary differences giving rise to both the debits and credits to the individual
accounts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
By this Third Report and Order, the Commission makes final decisions on 50 pioneer's preference requests related
to broadband 2 GHz Personal Communications Services (PCS). The Commission awards pioneer's preferences to three
applicants and denies the remaining 47 requests. This action guarantees a license to each pioneer in 30 megahertz
of spectrum in a Major Trading Area (MTA) if the applicant is otherwise eligible to hold such a license and subject to
any changes upon reconsideration in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314 that affect service areas or spectrum blocks. The
action is intended to appropriately reward the three parties that pioneered new PCS services and technologies.

Summary of Third Report and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In the Tentative Decision and Memorandum Opinion and Order (Tentative Decision) (57 FR 57458, December 4, 1992)
in this proceeding, the Commission proposed to award pioneer's preferences to American Personal Communications
(APC), Cox Enterprises, Inc. (Cox), and Omnipoint Communications, Inc. (Omnipoint) and to deny 53 other requests.
Subsequently, in the First Report and Order (58 FR 42681, August 11, 1993) in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314 and ET Docket
No. 92&hyph;100, six of these 53 requests were found to address 900 MHz narrowband services and therefore final action
on these six was taken in that proceeding. The Commission adopted final rules for broadband 2 GHz PCS in the Second Report
and Order (58 FR 59174, November 8, 1993) in this proceeding. Seven blocks of spectrum were allocated for licensed
2 GHz PCS encompassing 120 megahertz at 1850&hyph;1890, 1930&hyph;1970, 2130&hyph;2150, and 2180&hyph;2200 MHz.
Regional and local PCS service areas based upon MTAs and Basic Trading Areas (BTAs) also were adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Commission's pioneer's preference rules provide preferential treatment in its licensing process to parties
that demonstrate their responsibility for developing new communications services and technologies. To be granted
a pioneer's preference, an applicant must demonstrate that it has developed the new service or technology; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that it has developed the capabilities or possibilities of the technology or service or has brought them to a more
advanced or effective state. The applicant also must demonstrate the technical feasibility of the new service or
technology, either by submitting a technical feasibility showing or at least preliminary results of an experiment.
Finally, a preference will be granted only if the rules adopted are a reasonable outgrowth of the proposal and lend
themselves to grant of a preference. An applicant meeting this standard will be placed on a pioneer's preference track,
will not be subject to competing applications, and if otherwise qualified will receive a license. Other applicants
will compete for additional licenses on a separate track. The pioneer's preference rules are intended to foster development
of new services and improve existing services by reducing the delays and risks innovators otherwise would face with
the Commission's licensing process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In the Tentative Decision, the Commission proposed to grant APC, Cox, and Omnipoint a pioneer's preference and
to deny 53 requests that is tentatively concluded did not merit preferences. After opportunity for additional comment
and replies focused on the Tentative Decision, the Commission found that APC, Cox, and Omnipoint meet the pioneer's
preference standard and therefore merit award of preferences; and that the remaining applicants do not meet this
standard and therefore do not merit award of preferences.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. APC was granted a pioneer's preference for its development and demonstration of technologies that facilitate
spectrum sharing by PCS facilities and microwave systems at 2 GHz. APC's analysis and testing demonstrated that there
exists unused spectrum in the 1850&hyph;1990 MHz band sufficient to allow immediate initiation of PCS services without
first having to relocate existing microwave operations. Its study changed the focus of attention from relocating
fixed microwave operations before initiating PCS to initially implementing PCS while sharing the spectrum with
the existing microwave operations. This study, and the transition plan presented in comments submitted by APC, have
elements in common with the transition plan adopted in ET Docket No. 92&hyph;9 to facilitate making 2 GHz spectrum
available for emerging technologies, including PCS. Further, APC developed Frequency Agile Sharing Technology
(FAST) and demonstrated that it provides a practical means to transition from fixed services to shared fixed and mobile
services in this spectrum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. As explained by APC, FAST is a frequency planning and management tool used to predict (and avoid) interference both
between private operational fixed service (POFS) and PCS systems, and within a PCS system. The FAST system utilizes
theoretical interference analyses verified by signal strength measurements to determine frequency assignments
to PCS base stations. This function is accomplished by a Channel Utilization Controller (CUC), which monitors and
determines the channels each PCS base station may use. The CUC monitors coverage and interference; analyzes and integrates
measured data; integrates supporting data bases; and supports data communications links to each PCS base station.
For each PCS base station the CUC calculates theoretical interference values and areas for every POFS station in its
data base. Both PCS-to-POFS and POFS-to-PCS interference is calculated. The CUC then compiles a list of available
channels for each base station. The theoretical interference analysis is recalculated when PCS and/or POFS systems
are changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. APC states that FAST technology can be used with any relatively narrow band PCS system channel architecture employing
a channel bandwidth of 5 megahertz or less. In particular, APC states that the FAST system can be used in conjunction
with code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access, time division duplexed, and frequency
division duplexed systems that use various transmit-receive frequency separations. APC asserts that testing of
its FAST/CDMA system verified the ability of its technology to complete PCS calls without causing interference to
existing microwave operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Cox was granted a preference for having developed and demonstrated PCS/cable plant interface technology and equipment
that interfaces existing cable plant with new PCS wireless applications, resulting in spectrum-efficient applications
for PCS. Cox first proposed using cable systems to provide backbone functions for PCS (instead of using the existing
telephone or fixed microwave networks), applied to the Commission for a PCS experimental license, and successfully
developed and tested equipment. Through experiments, Cox demonstrated cost-effective integration of PCS and cable
networks that makes more efficient use of existing cable plant without impairing existing cable services. Cox designed,
developed, and tested multi-backhaul configurations and multi-PCS radio systems with hand-off capability, centralized
modulation, and distributed antenna configurations. These capabilities were realized through its design and development
work, the key to which is its ``cable microcell integrator'' that Cox developed to connect PCS handsets to its embedded
cable plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Using the existing cable plant in PCS network design permits economical and rapid deployment of PCS systems and
substitution of existing infrastructure for increasingly scarce spectrum. The efforts of Cox advanced PCS system
design by demonstrating the feasibility of integrating cable networks with full-featured PCS systems. Its developments
potentially permit offering efficient PCS service in a timely, cost efficient manner with no impairment to existing
cable services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Omnipoint was granted a preference for its development of 2 GHz equipment that uses advanced techniques that will
facilitate continued development and implementation of PCS services and technologies. Omnipoint was the first
to produce practical, working 2 GHz equipment for PCS. It engaged in radio frequency engineering and related spread
spectrum product design, development, miniaturization, and manufacture of 2 GHz equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Omnipoint designed and manufactured equipment that uses direct sequence spread spectrum access techniques
in a 5 or 10 megahertz channel. The original work of Omnipoint contributed significantly to the development and testing
of PCS services and design concepts that will facilitate initial implementation of PCS in the 2 GHz band on a sharing
basis with fixed microwave licensees. Omnipoint has demonstrated that its 2 GHz PCS equipment uses innovative technology,
combining spread spectrum and time division techniques. Further, Omnipoint has demonstrated the capability of
providing PCS service using its equipment. Finally, the use of Omnipoint's handsets by other parties to develop PCS
experimental systems has fostered the development of PCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. By receiving a pioneer's preference, APC, Cox, and Omnipoint, if otherwise qualified, will not be subject to competing
license applications in Channel Block A, a 30 megahertz MTA in the 1850&hyph;1865 and 1930&hyph;1945 MHz bands. APC,
Cox, and Omnipoint argued that a 30 megahertz MTA grant was necessary to permit implementation of the systems they
proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Cablevision Systems Corporation (Cablevision), Southwestern Bell Corporation (SBC), and Fidelity Investments
and Cylink Corporation (Fidelity/Cylink) disagreed that a 30 megahertz MTA license should be awarded pioneers.
Cablevision contended that a 20 megahertz BTA block would permit the grantees to use the band in which they have conducted
experiments, while not conveying a windfall 30 megahertz MTA block that could have a preclusive effect on other licensees.
SBC concurred, stating that a 20 megahertz BTA block would be enough spectrum to provide adequate PCS service. Fidelity/Cylink
argued that a 10 megahertz BTA block at 2130&hyph;2200 MHz would be adequate because such a block would enable the provision
of full-featured PCS, as well as many specialized PCS services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The Commission found the arguments of APC, Cox, and Omnipoint persuasive. Each applicant conducted experiments
in the 1850&hyph;1990 MHz band, not in the 2130&hyph;2200 MHz band. An award in the lower band is appropriate to ensure
that the grantees can implement the services they have proposed. While the Commission continues to believe that the
upper band has the potential to provide a variety of important PCS services, APC, Cox, and Omnipoint have designed
their systems and conducted their experiments in the 1850&hyph;1990 MHz band. Further, the Commission is not convinced
that a 20 megahertz BTA grant would be adequate, given the nature of the systems proposed. Accordingly, the Commission
awarded each pioneer a 30 megahertz MTA block in the service area each requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The Commission instructed the licensing bureau to condition licenses issued as a result of these pioneer's preference
grants upon construction of PCS systems that substantially use the design and technologies upon which the preference
awards are based and upon each licensee holding its license for a minimum of three years or until the construction requirements
applicable to the five-year build-out period specified in Section 99.206 of the Commission's Rules have been satisfied,
whichever, is earlier. APC's service area is the MTA that includes Washington, DC and Baltimore, Maryland; Cox's
service area is the MTA that includes San Diego, California; and Omnipoint's service area is the MTA that includes
northern New Jersey. The Commission noted that both PCS channel blocks and service areas are the subject of petitions
for reconsideration and clarification. Should either PCS channel blocks or service areas be amended on reconsideration,
the pioneer's preferences will be modified accordingly.

15. Finally, the Commission stated that the 47 pioneer's preference requests that were found not to have met the pioneer's
preference standard were denied for a variety of reasons. Some of these requests were incompatible with the rules
adopted in the Second Report and Order in this proceeding, some did not demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
technologies, some did not demonstrate innovation, and some did not demonstrate the capabilities or possibilities
of specific identifiable PCS technologies or services or show how these technologies or services had been brought
to a more advanced or effective state.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS implements a regulatory amendment that prohibits the retention of groundfish caught with unauthorized gear
in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Alaska. In addition, this action implements a technical amendment that organizes
all fishing gear definitions as paragraphs under the single definition of ``authorized fishing gear''. This action
is necessary to prevent fishing with unauthorized gear and associated preemption of fishing grounds and gear conflicts,
and undermining prohibited species bycatch measures in the groundfish fishery. It is intended to support the goals
and objectives contained in the Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and the
Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI).

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the EEZ of the GOA and the BSAI is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according
to the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North
Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C.
1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) (Magnuson Act), and are implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672
and 675. General regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulatory action amends 50 CFR 672.7 and 675.7 to prohibit the retention of groundfish caught with other than
authorized fishing gear types. Authorized fishing gear are all fishing gear types currently defined at &sect;&sect;672.2
and 675.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59980). A complete description of, and justification for, changes to regulations that
prohibit the retention of groundfish caught with other than authorized fishing gear types were discussed in the proposed
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment on the proposed rule was invited through December 13, 1993. One letter opposing and one letter supporting
the proposed action were received within the comment period and are summarized and responded to below in the ``Response
to Comment'' section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon reviewing the reasons for and the comments on this action, NMFS has determined that this rule is necessary for
fishery conservation and management and has approved it.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 1:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prohibiting fishing gear types not defined in the regulations will stifle gear innovations and development by the
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule will not stifle gear innovations or the development of new fishing gear by the industry. Gear innovations
and development can be accomplished within existing regulations governing experimental fishing at &sect;&sect;672.6
and 675.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under an experimental fishing permit, otherwise unauthorized gear could be assessed relative to fishing efficiency,
bycatch mortality rates, and the effects on the biological and physical environment. Fishing gear types assessed
under this process could be subsequently authorized under future regulatory amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prohibiting gear types not defined in the regulations is supported because new gear types should be thoroughly tested.
However, the proposed rule did not assess and does not prevent the use of imported gear, in particular the use of pair
trawls, as an authorized gear type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this action is to limit the fishing gear types employed in the groundfish fisheries off Alaska to those
traditionally used, including pair trawls. Any vessels participating in a fishery with pair trawls are subject to
observer requirements by &sect;&sect;672.27 and 675.25. The use of imported gear would be inconsistent with regulations
unless it conforms to the authorized fishing gear definition. NMFS will continue to obtain information from observers
about performance of each authorized fishing gear type used in the groundfish fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Technical Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule by technical amendment moves existing definitions of fishing gear types from alphabetic locations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;672.2 and 675.2 and reorganizes them under a new definition, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Authorized fishing gear.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the final rule does not change existing definitions from the proposed rule, it redesignates the fishing
gear definitions by removing them from their alphabetical order and placing them as paragraphs under this new definition.
Three definitions, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trawl, Non-trawl
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Longline
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are modified to provide consistency in the fishing gear definitions in the GOA and BSAI regulations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is today promulgating a rule to amend the financial responsibility requirements
for underground storage tanks (USTs) containing petroleum that appear in subpart H of 40 CFR part 280. Specifically,
this rule modifies the financial responsibility compliance date under 40 CFR 280.91(e) for one category of UST owners.
Under this modification, Federally-recognized Indian tribes that own USTs on Indian lands are required to comply
with Federal Financial Responsibility requirements of 40 CFR part 280 subpart H_Financial Responsibility_by December
31, 1998 if those USTs are in compliance with applicable technical requirements for USTs in 40 CFR part 280. Today's
rule extends the deadline for certain USTs owned by Indian tribes from the previous date of February 18, 1994. This
change will allow EPA, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian tribes additional time to explore options for solving
the root problem of lack of funding for past contamination on Indian lands and further assist tribes with future technical
requirements, such as tank upgrading. EPA is not changing the financial responsibility deadline for rural petroleum
marketers or local governments. A discussion of the Agency rationale behind this decision can be found in section
III. C. under ``

 EPA is today finalizing a rule that would allow certain Federally-recognized Indian tribes that own USTs containing
petroleum on Indian lands additional time to comply with the financial responsibility requirements. Specifically,
this rule modifies the compliance date under 40 CFR 280.91(e). Under this modification, Indian tribes that own USTs
containing petroleum on Indian lands must comply with the financial responsibility requirements by December 31,
1998. To qualify for the 1998 financial responsibility deadline, tribally-owned USTs must be in compliance with
the technical requirements for USTs described in 40 CFR part 280. Technical compliance for USTs includes, for example,
leak detection and reporting. The technical requirements criterion has been included to protect human health and
the environment on Indian lands. EPA is not changing the financial responsibility deadline for rural petroleum marketers
or local governments. A discussion of Agency rationale behind this decision can be found in section III C.

These regulations are issued under the authority of sections 2002, 9001, 9002, 9003, 9004, 9005, 9006, 9007, and 9009
of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6912, 6991, 6991a, 6991b, 6991c, 6991d, 6991e, 6991f, and 6991h).

This rule will be effective on February 28, 1994, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d). This rule may be made effective immediately
because it extends an existing compliance date and there is good cause to make that extension immediately effective
within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 553(d)(1) and (3).

III. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 26, 1988, EPA promulgated financial responsibility requirements applicable to owners and operators
of underground storage tanks (USTs) containing petroleum (53 FR 43322). To meet the requirements, owners and operators
must demonstrate that they can pay for the costs of cleanups and third-party damages resulting from any leaks that
may occur. In the final rule, EPA established a phased compliance schedule for owners and operators of petroleum USTs.
The principal reason for adopting the phased compliance approach was to provide the time necessary for providers
of financial assurance mechanisms (including private insurance companies and states intending to establish state
assurance funds) to develop new policies and programs or conform their policies and programs with EPA requirements.
See 53 FR 43324. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When devising the phased compliance approach, the Agency wanted to achieve the best balance between the need to demonstrate
financial responsibility for UST releases and the time necessary for owners and operators to obtain assurance mechanisms.
The Agency attempted to establish compliance dates that were as early as possible, considering the type of assurance
different types of facilities were likely to obtain. Petroleum marketers owning or operating 1,000 or more USTs and
non-marketers with more than $20 million in tangible net worth were required to comply by January 24, 1989, based primarily
on their ability to qualify for self-insurance. Petroleum marketers with 100 to 999 USTs were required to comply by
October 26, 1989. These marketers were estimated to be relatively more likely to be able to obtain insurance; some
of them were also expected to qualify as self-insurers. Petroleum marketers owning 13 to 99 USTs at more than one facility
were originally required to comply by April 26, 1990. However, on May 2, 1990, the Agency published a rule (55 FR 18566)
extending this compliance date to April 26, 1991. These marketers were thought to be less likely to be able to obtain
insurance than members of the October 26, 1989, compliance group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petroleum marketers owning fewer than 13 USTs at more than one facility or owning only one facility with fewer than
100 USTs, as well as non-marketers with less than $20 million in net worth and local governments (including Indian
tribes) were originally required to comply by October 26, 1990. This group was expected to rely primarily on state
assurance funds for compliance. (State assurance funds provide money for cleanups to owners and operators in their
states. Owners and operators in states with assurance funds are deemed to be in compliance with financial responsibility
for the amount covered by the fund once the state submits the fund to EPA for approval unless and until EPA disapproves
the fund.) On October 31, 1990, EPA extended the compliance deadline for one year for small marketers (with fewer than
13 USTs or fewer than 100 USTs at a single facility) and small non-marketers (with less than $20 million in net worth),
otherwise known as Category IV. This extension was based on the need for additional time for state assurance funds
to be developed. In addition, EPA extended the compliance deadline for local governments and Indian tribes until
one year after publication of a final rule with additional self-insurance mechanisms for local governments to use
to demonstrate compliance. This rule was published on February 18, 1993 (58 FR 9026).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 23, 1991, EPA once again extended the compliance deadline for the Category IV group (small marketers with
fewer than 13 tanks at more than one facility or fewer than 100 tanks at a single facility as well as non-marketers with
net worth less than $20 million) to December 31, 1993 (56 FR 66369). EPA based the extension on its understanding that
more members of this compliance group than the Agency had originally projected must rely on state assurance funds,
rather than on insurance, to demonstrate compliance with the financial responsibility requirements. EPA believed
that, in order for owners and operators to rely on state assurance funds as compliance mechanisms, states must have
more time to submit their state assurance funds to EPA for approval. Currently, 31 state assurance funds have been
approved by EPA and an additional eight state assurance funds have been submitted to EPA for approval. (It is important
to note that upon submission of a state assurance fund to the EPA Regional Administrator, the fund is considered to
be approved unless and until EPA disapproves it.) Additionally, the extension provided states with more time to develop
and implement financial assistance programs (e.g., direct loan programs, loan guarantee programs, grant programs)
which help owners and operators (especially small businesses) pay for technical requirements such as tank upgrading.
These technical improvements, in turn, help USTs meet insurers' underwriting criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency, however, continued to be concerned about the effects of its regulations on the regulated community. By
analyzing the costs of the requirements, EPA found that the affordability of financial responsibility compliance
is often tied to early compliance with technical requirements such as tank upgrading, since, for example, private
insurance companies may refuse to provide coverage unless they are certain that a site does not pose a high risk of leaking.
EPA believed that the costs associated with the technical requirements are an important factor underlying the inability
of some small owners and operators to meet the financial responsibility requirements. These costs coupled with the
lack of a state assurance fund, grant, or loan program could force some gas stations to close their tanks when the 1993
financial responsibility compliance date fell. EPA believed that tank closure could be particularly problematic
when those tanks provide essential services to rural communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this concern about the availability of fuel in rural areas, EPA proposed a December 31, 1998 compliance
date for certain petroleum marketers, local governments, and Indian tribes, that meet Federally-determined criteria
(58 FR 43770). The objective of the August 17, 1993 proposed rule was to obtain data on whether an additional extension
of the financial responsibility requirements was needed, and for whom. The Agency intended to limit any additional
extension to, at most, a small sub-group of marketers currently in Category IV, as well as certain local governments
and Indian tribes; EPA did not want to change compliance dates for all Category IV marketers or local governments on
the belief that most of these tank owners were already in compliance with the financial responsibility requirements
due to the existence of state assurance funds and reliance on self-insurance mechanisms. The August 17, 1993 proposed
rule included eligibility criteria limiting the proposed 1998 compliance group to rural petroleum marketers that
met a hardship criterion of annual profit on gasoline sales of $15,000 or less, rural local governments that use tanks
for essential services such as police and fire departments, and Indian tribes. (The definition of rural was obtained
from the Farmers Home Administration within the U.S. Department of Agriculture.) In addition, all owners in the new
1998 compliance group would have to ensure that their tanks were in compliance with applicable technical requirements,
such as leak detection. The technical compliance criterion was included to protect human health and the environment
regardless of a change in the financial responsibility deadline. EPA also stressed the fact that any change in the
financial responsibility compliance date would not remove the liability on the part of the owner or operator to clean-up
a leak.

IV. Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA received 58 comments on the August 18, 1993 proposed extension. 34 commenters supported an extension for one or
more groups. 21 commenters opposed any extension of the financial responsibility requirements. No commenters objected
to an extended compliance deadline for Indian tribes while one commenter supported it. One commenter remained neutral
on the subject and two additional comments were received regarding the proposed definition of rural, as defined by
the Farmers Home Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on EPA analysis of the comments received as well as the rest of the administrative record from the proposal, the
Agency is finalizing an extension to 1998 for Federally-recognized Indian tribes that own USTs on Indian lands. No
other entity (petroleum marketer or local government) has been included in this 1998 compliance group. A discussion
of comments relating to a 1998 compliance deadline for petroleum marketers and local governments can be found in section
III C.

A. Indian Tribes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Based on an analysis of the administrative record for this rulemaking and lack of opposition to an extension for tribes,
EPA is extending the compliance deadline for Tribally-owned USTs on Indian lands to December 31, 1998 if the USTs meet
the technical compliance criterion. The Agency is sensitive to the lack of funding available to help Indian tribes
pay for environmental problems and acknowledges that mechanisms used by other owners, such as state assurance funds
or private insurance, may be inaccessible to tribes. The Agency has retained the technical compliance criterion
in order to protect human health and the environment on Indian lands and expects that inclusion of this criterion may
prompt some owners to come into compliance with the technical requirements in order to qualify for the extension.
(Tanks owned by Indian tribes which are out of compliance with applicable technical requirements would not be eligible
for the 1998 deadline.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional time will also allow the Agency to work with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) at the U.S. Department
of the Interior to explore options for solving the root problem of lack of funding for past contamination on Indian
lands and further assist tribes with future technical requirements, such as tank upgrading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A compliance date of December 31, 1998 was selected for Indian tribes because this date corresponds with the final
technical compliance date for tank upgrading. Tribes unable to comply with the financial responsibility requirements
at that time face the more costly technical requirement of upgrading their USTs. At that point, tanks not in technical
compliance would be forced to close with or without the financial assurance coverage. Conversely, owners able to
meet the technical requirements at that time would be more likely to obtain an affordable assurance mechanism, such
as private insurance, since the tanks would be considered an insurable, reasonable risk.

B. Implementation of Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA intends to promulgate regulations that pose the least burden to the affected regulated community while protecting
human health and the environment. Therefore, no change in reporting requirements or recordkeeping procedures from
the October 26, 1988 rule is incorporated into this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The August 17, 1993 proposed rule included a requirement that UST owners self-certify for an extension and keep a record
of the proposed compliance checklist on file for enforcement purposes. Based on a review of the comments and the rest
of the administrative record for the proposal, the Agency has decided that this self-certification is unnecessary
for implementing this rule and has therefore decided to delete the self-certification and recordkeeping requirement.

C. Discussion of Options Proposed But Not Finalized for Petroleum Marketers and Local Governments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As noted above, EPA received 58 comments on the August, 1993 proposed rule. Of the 34 comments received in support of
a 1998 compliance deadline, 17 specifically supported an extension only for petroleum marketers. An additional
seven comments were received in support of local governments, four for non-marketers (such as rental car companies,
etc.), and one for Indian tribes. Five commenters supported an extension for all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Category IV firms and local governments regardless of criteria, or not at all, concluding that a limited extension
would be unfair to the entities not included in the 1998 compliance group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-one commenters were against any additional extension to 1998. Of the 21 comments which disagreed with the
proposed extension, eight were provided by state agencies that administer UST regulatory or state fund programs.
One commenter was neutral, neither agreeing or disagreeing with the proposed compliance date, and two additional
comments addressed only the definition of rural. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters arguing for a 1998 compliance date for certain petroleum marketers and local governments stated that
the additional time was needed to keep small businesses open. Several commenters said that compliance with financial
responsibility was difficult in states without state assurance funds. In fact, of the commenters supporting a 1998
compliance date for one or more groups, 12 out of 35 were received from a state without a state assurance fund. In addition,
some commenters said that insurance was not affordable, particularly when tanks have not been upgraded. Two commenters
urged an extended compliance date in two states that plan to adopt a state assurance fund or loan program. One of those
commenters felt that a 1996 compliance date would be acceptable since it would correspond to the date the state loan
program plans to be operational. Another commenter noted that not all local governments can pass one of the four additional
self-insurance mechanisms promulgated in February, 1993, and one additional commenter urged EPA to extend the financial
responsibility compliance date for hospitals that use their tanks to fuel emergency generators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters arguing against an additional extension to 1998 for local governments and petroleum marketers
stated that most of these owners were already in compliance due to state assurance funds. Several commenters also
stated that an extension would not be fair to those owners already in compliance with the financial responsibility
requirements. Others felt an extended compliance group to 1998 would incorrectly imply that the remaining technical
compliance dates would be extended by EPA as well. Other commenters noted that the criteria included in the proposed
rule were difficult to implement and would prove burdensome to states with regard to enforcement since different
petroleum marketers and local governments would have different compliance dates. Other commenters feared that
adoption of a 1998 deadline for certain gas stations and local governments would hurt the environment, since the requirement
was necessary to ensure that money would be available to pay for cleanups. One commenter stated that previous compliance
date extensions reduced the volume of business available to private insurers trying to create a market for UST insurance,
thereby increasing the price. Another commenter echoed that sentiment, saying that previous extensions had stopped
private mechanisms, such as insurance, from developing fully. Finally, several commenters state that it was appropriate
to exclude non-marketers from any additional extension since sales of petroleum were not crucial to their operations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on a review of the comments and the administrative record, EPA has decided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to extend the financial responsibility compliance deadline for petroleum marketers, non-marketers, or local governments.
While the Agency acknowledges that some of these owners, especially in those few states without a state assurance
fund, may have difficulty complying with the financial responsibility requirements, EPA agrees with commenters
that say that most owners and operators are already covered by either state assurance funds, self-insurance mechanisms
or private insurance. Agency analysis indicates that compliance may be as high as 98% for local governments with the
addition of the four self-assurance mechanisms promulgated in February, 1993. In addition, just 14% of all tanks
are in states without legislation creating state assurance funds. The Agency also agrees that another extension
hurts EPA credibility with regard to upcoming technical compliance dates and agrees that a later compliance date
is unfair to owners and operators already in compliance. In addition, a 1998 compliance deadline for some local governments
and petroleum marketers would create an administrative burden for states to implement, since some states would need
to change their legislation or regulations in order to adopt the new deadline. EPA also acknowledges the difficulty
in trying to define an appropriate subgroup and believes that inclusion of certain marketers and local governments
in a new compliance group would create additional confusion in the regulated community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with commenters who feared that adoption of a 1998 deadline for certain gas stations and local governments
might hurt the environment in the event that funds are not available to undertake corrective action. In adopting the
phased compliance approach, the Agency wanted to achieve the best balance between the need to demonstrate financial
responsibility for UST releases and the ability of different types of tank owners to obtain the assurance mechanisms.
In deciding not to extend the compliance deadline for petroleum marketers and local governments, the Agency has decided
that, since most marketers and local governments can comply, the balance has to be weighed in favor of demonstrating
compliance. On the other hand, the current inability of Indian tribes to demonstrate compliance as explained in section
IV.A above led the Agency to reach the opposite decision in that situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also received comments with regard to the criteria discussed in the proposed rule applicable to petroleum marketers
and local governments. Most commenters supported the use of the Farmers Home Administration definition of rural,
but felt that a hardship determination based on profit should be replaced with a measure of yearly throughput of gasoline
through an UST system.

V. Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section provides an estimate of the economic impacts of the proposed rule. Because the proposed rule will not
cause an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more and will not cause an increase in the costs of production
or the prices charged by the affected community, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. Instead, EPA has prepared
an economic impact analysis to estimate the number of affected facilities that would benefit from this additional
flexibility.

A. Economic Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The economic analysis examines the potential economic effects of adopting a new compliance category to 1998 and estimates
the number of potentially affected entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overall, approximately 1.3 million USTs are subject to the technical and financial responsibility standards. The
number of tribally-owned USTs that could be eligible for the 1998 compliance date numbers approximately 500. These
500 tribally-owned USTs represent approximately 10% of all active tanks on Indian lands. (The remainder of the tanks
on Indian lands are owned by private individuals and firms, as opposed to Federally-recognized tribes.) The total
number of tanks eligible for the 1998 compliance date would be reduced, however, with the inclusion of the technical
compliance criterion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
when an Agency publishes a notice of rulemaking, for a rule that will have a significant effect on a substantial number
of small entities, the agency must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis
that considers the effect of the rule on small entities (i.e.: Small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental
jurisdictions). EPA believes that this rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The new compliance deadline to 1998 will provide relief to members of this compliance group
by allowing them additional time to comply with the financial responsibility requirements. Accordingly, the Agency
has concluded that the law does not require a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, and certifies that this rule, if promulgated,
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, OMB has notified EPA that it considers this a ``significant regulatory
action'' within the meaning of the Executive Order. EPA has submitted this action to OMB for review. Changes made in
response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.

Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. The United States Grain Standards Act provides in section 87g that no State or subdivision
may require or impose any requirements or restrictions concerning the inspection, weighing, or description of grain
under the USGSA. Otherwise, this proposed rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies
unless they present irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be
exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
David R. Galliart, Acting Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Most users of the official inspection and weighing services
and those persons who perform those services do not meet the requirements of small entities as defined in the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601

Information Collection Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements
contained in part 800 have been previously approved by OMB under control number 0580&hyph;0013.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the early 1980s, FGIS has provided official service under the Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) to test grain
and processed grain products for the residue of three pesticides, carbon tetrachloride, methylbromide, and ethylene
dibromide. This service has been available upon request from FGIS' Commodity Testing Laboratory in Beltsville,
MD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGIS is now proposing to expand its pesticide residue testing program to include testing wheat for 29 additional pesticides
under the authority of the United States Grain Standards Act. The service will be performed on a request basis; it will
not be required for either domestic or export shipments. All samples will be tested at the Kansas City Technical Center.
A minimum of 500 grams of wheat will be required for testing. The residues (routine compounds) that will be certified
are as follows: Aldrin, Azinphos-methyl, Alpha-BHC, Beta-BHC, Delta-BHC, Carbofuran, Chlorpyrifos, Chlorothalonil,
Chlorpyrifos Methyl, P.P'-DDD, P.P'-DDE, P.P'-DDT, Diclofop-methyl, Dieldrin, Dimethoate, Endosulfan, Endrin,
Esfenvalerate, Fenitrothion, Fenthion, Folpet, Lindane, Malathion, Methidathion, Methoxychlor, Parathion,
Parathion-methyl, Pirimiphos-methyl, and Triallate. These compounds will be analyzed by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory analytical results will be provided to the applicant as soon as practicable. Generally the testing requires
a minimum of 48 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed fees will be set forth in &sect;800.71(a), Schedule A. The proposed fee is $200 for each sample tested
during a regular workday and $300 for each sample tested during a non-regular workday. The proposed fees are intended
to cover, as nearly as practicable, the FGIS operating cost including related supervisory and administrative costs.
Testing for additional residues (special compounds) within FGIS capabilities may be requested at a proposed rate
of $100 per hour during a regular workday and $150 per hour during a nonregular workday. The testing fee does not include
charges for sampling. Sampling service fees, if required, will be assessed in accordance with the sampling rates
in &sect;800.71(a), Schedule A. Testing of other grains will be provided as a service at a later date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major importers of U.S. wheat such as Japan, China, Mexico, and Korea have indicated a strong interest in having U.S.
grain tested for the presence of specific pesticide residues. FGIS is proposing to offer certification of these specific
pesticide residue levels for export and domestic wheat. The anticipated volume of requests for this service is 500
samples per year or 10 per week. This represents a generated income of approximately $100,000 per year which will cover
the costs of providing the service.

hearing is to receive evidence on proposals to amend provisions of the order. The proposed amendments would make changes
in order provisions regarding: Volume control; nomination and membership of the Filbert/Hazelnut Marketing Board
(Board); collecting assessments; and the administration and operation of the program. The proposed amendments
were submitted by the Board, the agency responsible for local administration of the order, to make the order more consistent
with current industry conditions and needs. The Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS),
proposes other conforming and necessary changes.

are tailored to the size and nature of small business. Interested persons are invited to present evidence at the hearing
on the possible regulatory and informational impact of the proposals on small businesses.

The amendments proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. They are not
intended to have retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has
jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later
than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Act and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing
the formulation of marketing agreements and orders (7 CFR Part 900). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Board proposes several amendments to the order's volume control provisions. The Board recommends an amendment
that would expand the primary (domestic) market by adding Hawaii to the distribution area that currently is the continental
United States (including Alaska) (&sect;982.16). In addition, the Board proposes an amendment that would allow
the Board, with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture, to make future changes in the primary market's distribution
area (&sect;982.16). The Board proposes another amendment designed to provide the Board with additional flexibility
to release up to 15 percent of the average volume acquired by the trade for the primary market for the preceding three
years' rather than the mandatory 15 percent release specified in the current order (&sect;982.40). The Board recommends
an amendment that would allow the Board to establish identification standards for inspected and certified lots of
hazelnuts rather than the current order requirement which specifies seals, stamps, tags or other identification
(&sect;982.46). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board recommends several proposed amendments regarding nomination and Board membership. The Board proposes
an amendment to change the length of the term of office to two years from the current one-year period with a corresponding
change limiting the consecutive terms to three two-year terms rather than the current six consecutive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-year terms (&sect;982.33). A corresponding amendment would establish the qualifications for nominating handler
Board members based on the handlers' previous two years' volume handled rather than the previous one year volume handled,
as currently required (&sect;982.30). Similarly, the Board recommends a conforming change to the qualification
period for weighing handler votes to the previous two marketing years rather than the previous one year marketing
year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;982.32). The Board proposes that a change be made in the voting procedures when calculating handler voting
qualifications by changing the minimum weighted volume to one ton rather than the current one percent (&sect;982.32).
The Board also proposes that a clarification be added to voting procedures to make it clear that eligible handlers
vote for only one member and one alternate member (&sect;982.32).

The Board recommends several amendments to the administrative procedures and operations of the order's programs.
The Board recommends changing the name of the regulated product from ``filberts'' or ``filberts/hazelnuts'' to
the single name ``hazelnuts'' (&sect;982.4). Another amendment would allow telephone votes taken by the Board to
remain unconfirmed until the next Board meeting rather than being confirmed in writing by individual members immediately
after the vote (&sect;982.37). Also, the Board proposes an amendment to remove the requirement that ``verbatim''
reports be made of Board proceedings on marketing policy meetings (&sect;982.39). One amendment would remove an
incorrect word in the current order language which determines handler credit for ungraded product (&sect;982.51).
The Board has recommended an amendment which would provide that, when the Board establishes bonding rates for handlers
who temporarily defer meeting their restricted obligations, the Board would use the estimated value of restricted
credits rather than the estimated product value of a handler's deferred restricted obligation (&sect;982.54).
Further, the Board recommends that defaulted bond payments should be used by the Board to purchase excess restricted
credits from handlers rather than purchasing certified merchantable product which has already met restricted obligations
(&sect;982.54). Also, the Board recommends a corresponding change that such restricted credits should be used by
the handlers to liquidate their restricted obligation rather than be disposed of as restricted product (&sect;982.54).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposes two amendments to the assessment provision to allow the Board to accept advance assessment payments
(and provide discounts to those handlers who make advanced payments) and borrow money. Advance payments and borrowed
moneys would be used only for meeting administrative obligations before current year assessment payments are available
(&sect;982.61). The Board also proposes a new provision that would allow the Board to accept voluntary contributions
from willing individuals. Such contributions would be used only for production research, marketing research and
development, and marketing promotion, including paid advertising (new &sect;982.63). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Board proposes that a clarification be added to the exemption provision of the order to make it perfectly
clear that mail order sales to destinations outside the area of production are not exempt from order requirements
(&sect;982.57). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposals were submitted by the Board which works with the Department in administering the order. The Fruit
and Vegetable Division, AMS, proposes conforming changes to further clarify and assure consistency with existing
provisions of the order. The Board's proposed amendments have not received the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public hearing is held for the purpose of: (1) Receiving evidence about the economic and marketing conditions
which relate to the proposed amendments of the order; (2) determining whether there is a need for the proposed amendments
to the order; and (3) determining whether the proposed amendments, or appropriate modifications thereof, will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

On or before November 15, the Board shall meet to recommend to the Secretary the interim final and final free and restricted
percentages, including the portion of the restricted supply that may be shelled or exported. The interim final percentages
shall release 100 percent of the inshell trade demand previously computed by the Board for the marketing year. The
final free and restricted percentages may release up to an additional 15 percent of the average of the preceding three
years' trade acquisitions of inshell hazelnuts for desirable carryout. If the trade acquisitions during any or all
of these years were abnormal, the Board may use a prior year or years in determining this three-year average. The final
free and restricted percentages shall become effective 30 days prior to the end of the marketing year, or earlier as
may be recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary. The recommendations to the Secretary shall include

by the Board. Any handler desiring to export any part or all of that handler's certified merchantable restricted hazelnuts
shall deliver to the Board the certified merchantable restricted hazelnuts to be exported, but the Board shall be
obligated to sell in export only such quantities for which it may be able to find satisfactory export outlets. Any hazelnuts
so delivered for export which the Board is unable to export shall be returned to the handler delivering them. Sales
for export shall be made by the Board only on execution of an agreement to prevent reimportation into the area designated
in &sect;982.16. A handler may be permitted to act as an agent of the Board, upon such terms and conditions as the board
may specify, in negotiating export sales, and when so acting shall be entitled to receive a selling commission as authorized
by the Board. The proceeds of all export sales, after deducting all expenses actually and necessarily incurred, shall
be paid to the handler whose certified merchantable restricted hazelnuts are so sold by the Board.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations governing industrial radiography.
The proposed rule would include additional safety requirements to enhance the level of protection of radiographers
and the public and would clarify the regulations so that licensees may have a better understanding of what is expected
in radiographic operations. The proposed rule includes a number of updated radiography regulations that have been
adopted by the Agreement States. The major changes in the proposed rule include requirements for: (1) Two qualified
individuals to be present whenever radiography occurs at a temporary jobsite, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) mandatory certification of radiographers, (3) permanent radiographic installations, and (4) a radiation safety
officer. The format of the radiography regulations would be revised to place requirements into descriptive categories.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 34 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations was first published in 1965 (30 FR 8192) as part of the recodification
of parts 30 and 31 for the purpose of simplifying and clarifying the format of the then-current requirements on radiography
so that persons subject to byproduct material licensing regulations could conveniently use and understand them.
Numerous modifications to the original part 34 have been made since 1965, many of which have been directed toward the
safety aspects of field radiography. These modifications include performance requirements on radiography equipment
and requirements for the use of alarming ratemeters published in 1990 (55 FR 843; January 10, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 200 NRC radiography licensees with an additional 500 Agreement State licensees. Radiography
licensees often conduct business under both NRC and Agreement State jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC has not initiated an overall revision of part 34 in many years. However, a number of Agreement States have updated
their radiography regulations. The decision to develop an overall revision to 10 CFR part 34 was made with the intent
of establishing new safety requirements for radiography licensees and clarifying the regulation so that licensees
will have a better understanding of what is expected in radiographic operations. The format of the radiography regulations
would be revised to place requirements into descriptive categories that better describe the type of requirements
found in the subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC solicited recommendations on radiography issues at the 1991 Agreement States' meeting in Sacramento, CA,
as well as from NRC regional offices, radiography equipment manufacturers, and radiography licensees. Public comments
were solicited on the issue of radiographer certification at the May 19, 1991, annual meeting of the Conference of
Radiation Control Program Directors (CRCPD), Inc. in Wichita, Kansas, and a public workshop on radiographer certification
was held May 27&hyph;28, 1992, in Mobile, Alabama. A separate workshop was held on November 18, 1992, in Dallas, Texas,
to discuss recommendations received from the Agreement States and licensees on revision of the radiography regulations.
The transcripts of these meetings, which are available for inspection and copying in the NRC Public Document Room,
were reviewed in further developing the proposed revision. The NRC utilized part E of the ``Suggested State Regulations
for Control of Radiation'' developed by the CRCPD, part 31 of the Texas Regulations for Control of Radiation, Chapter
5 of the Louisiana regulations, and the Canadian ``Atomic Energy Control Regulations,'' that apply to radiography
in developing this proposed revision of part 34.

II. Petition for Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A petition was received on October 15, 1992, from the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE), Local No.
2, requesting an amendment to the radiography regulations to require a minimum of two radiographic personnel when
performing industrial radiography at temporary jobsites. The petition was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57392). Thirty-eight comment letters were received, 35 were in favor of granting the petition.
Resolution of this petition has been addressed in this proposed revision to part 34. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IUOE petition offered three options for the makeup of the two-person crew: (1) Two radiographers; (2) one radiographer
and one radiographer's assistant; and (3) one radiographer and one trainee, with the trainee having completed 40
hours of approved radiation safety training and passed an examination. The petitioners identified a number of problems
associated with the use of licensed material by one radiographer at temporary jobsites. These problems included:
(1) Difficulty keeping the area under constant surveillance while radiographic operations are ongoing; (2) difficulty
in maintaining surveillance when working in trenches; and (3) difficulty in obtaining assistance in the event of
an emergency if there is only one individual. The petitioners believe that the suggested change is necessary to ensure
a safe working environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments received raised concerns regarding the combination of a radiographer and a trainee as a two-person team.
Many stated that the trainee is an unskilled individual that may or may not achieve radiographer status and spending
the time and money for 40 hours training may not be financially feasible for some radiography companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule, if adopted, would constitute a partial granting of the petition in that it proposes to require,
at a minimum, a two-person crew whenever radiographic operations are being conducted outside of a permanent radiographic
installation. The NRC has decided not to adopt the term ``radiographer trainee,'' and is proposing that the second
person be another qualified radiographer or an individual who has met, at a minimum, the requirements for a radiographer's
assistant. The NRC recognizes that, in Agreement States, the training of those individuals designated as trainees
would meet the NRC's training requirements for a radiographer's assistant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated cost of requiring the two-person crew could be significant for licensees who send only one radiographer
to a temporary jobsite. However, the current regulation requires direct surveillance of the operation to prevent
unauthorized entry into a high radiation area. To comply with this regulation most licensees already must use more
than one qualified individual in many situations. For certain circumstances where a licensee could demonstrate
that adequate surveillance can be maintained by one radiographer, the Commission could consider granting an exemption
through the process described in the proposed &sect;34.111. The Commission is concerned that this requirement could
cause a significant impact on a number of small entities which currently do not use two-person crews, and is soliciting
comments on the potential impact. Furthermore, the Commission is interested in receiving proposals for alternatives
to the two-person requirement which would achieve comparable enhancements in safety with less of a burden on licensees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the Commission believes that by requiring at least two qualified individuals to always be present when
radiographic operations are being conducted, there will be a significant increase in assurance that operational
safety measures and emergency procedures will be effectively implemented. The expectation is that violations involving
failures to perform adequate radiation surveys of radiographic exposure devices and the surrounding area, failures
to adequately post and monitor the restricted area, and failures to lock and secure the camera when not in use will become
less frequent. Furthermore, if an incapacitating injury to a radiographer should occur at a remote location, the
presence of a second individual could be an important factor in preventing unnecessary radiation exposures. The
Commission is considering amending the Enforcement Policy as a result of this proposed rulemaking to provide, as
an example of a Severity Level III violation, the conduct of radiography operations without the required second radiographer
or individual with, at least, the qualifications of a radiographer's assistant as provided in the proposed &sect;34.41.

III. General Discussion of Proposed Rule Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments contain requirements which are intended to improve radiography safety. The first major
change is a proposal to require, at a minimum, two qualified individuals (two radiographers or a radiographer and
an individual who has met, at least, the requirements to be a radiographer's assistant) to be present any time radiographic
operations occur outside of a permanent radiographic installation. This issue has already been addressed under
Section II. Petition for Rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 19, 1991 (56 FR 11504), the NRC published a final rule which provided for a voluntary third-party radiographer
certification program through the American Society for Nondestructive Testing (ASNT), as discussed further in
Section IV. Several Agreement States have adopted mandatory radiographer state administered examination programs.
The promulgation of these programs, as well as other changes in their radiography regulations, have contributed
to an overall improvement in safety and a decrease in serious overexposures in these Agreement States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would recognize other certifying organizations who meet the requirements outlined in Appendix
A of the proposed rule. Independent certifying organizations would be required to meet all of the requirements listed
in Appendix A, while Agreement States that wish to become certifying entities would only be required to meet the requirements
listed in part II and III of the Appendix. The NRC plans to publish annually in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an updated list of certifying entities and to provide the list with license application forms. The NRC also plans to
investigate the feasibility of establishing a toll-free telephone number whereby licensees could obtain information
on approved certifying entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue involves the definition of a permanent radiographic installation. The proposed rule changes the definition
of a ``permanent radiographic installation'' to mean an enclosed shielded room, cell, or vault in which radiography
is performed. The terms ``designed or intended for radiography'' and ``regularly performed'' have been removed
from the definition to reduce any ambiguity as to what is intended. Under the existing rule, if a licensee has a room,
cell, or vault that meets the definition of a ``permanent radiographic installation'', then it must meet the special
safety requirements of &sect;34.33. The proposed rule adds two additional requirements: (1) To perform a daily check
of the visible and audible signals, and (2) to list all permanent facilities on the license. Under the proposed rule,
radiography can only be performed in one of two ways: (1) In a permanent radiographic installation with a qualified
radiographer, or (2) at any other location with at least two qualified individuals. The special safety requirements
of &sect;34.33 would not apply to the use of a shielded room at a temporary jobsite, although licensees would be permitted
to submit a license amendment requesting approval to use a shielded room which meets the requirements of &sect;34.33
as a permanent radiographic installation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule includes requirements specifying the qualifications and duties of the Radiation Safety Officer
(RSO). The RSO is the key licensee individual charged with the responsibility to ensure that the requirements in the
license are followed. These requirements have been based on similar commitments previously included in specific
license conditions on a case-by-case basis. The proposed rule would require additional special training for RSOs.
The Commission is considering permitting existing RSOs to obtain the additional training within 2 years from the
effective date of the rule and is specifically requesting comment on this proposed requirement.

IV. An Independent Certifying Entity (ASNT) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current ASNT program for certifying industrial radiographers was approved by its Board of Directors in March
1990 and offers certification for either isotope or x-ray users. The NRC staff has extensively reviewed this program,
which includes a written examination developed by the State of Texas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application to become a certified radiographer requires documentation of 40 hours of classroom training in radiation
safety topics specified by ASNT including those topics listed in the proposed &sect;34.43(f), documentation of
520 hours of direct hands-on experience with radiography sources and devices under the control of an NRC or Agreement
State licensee, and proof of successful completion of a practical examination on safety procedures administered
by an ASNT-recognized institution. Recognized institutions, generally the candidates' employers, have been licensed
by NRC or an Agreement State for the use of radiography sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After ASNT's approval of an application, a candidate radiographer takes the written examination. The examination
is administered by ASNT or the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, Inc. (CRCPD) and subsequently
sent to the State of Texas for grading. The results of the examination are forwarded to ASNT. The written examination
covers the fundamental radiation safety principles outlined in 10 CFR part 34, pertinent Federal and State regulations,
basic radiographic equipment operation, general operating and emergency procedures, radiation detection instrumentation,
and radiation safety procedures applicable to industrial radiography. In addition, candidates are required to
sign a pledge that they will abide by the ASNT Rules of Conduct. On successful completion of the required examinations
and other requirements, a certified individual is provided with a wallet card identifying him/her as an ASNT-certified
radiographer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASNT certification is valid for 3 years, unless suspended or revoked for cause. Renewal of certification may be accomplished
either with or without reexamination. A candidate for renewal without reexamination must document continuous active
full-time employment in radiography for at least 6 of the last 12 months. In addition, the candidate must document
at least 8 hours, each year, of classroom refresher training covering basic radiation safety principles, equipment
operations, emergency procedures, new safety regulations, license requirements, and other pertinent information.
If these criteria are not met, the candidate must retake the written examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASNT Rules of Conduct require certified individuals to comply with NRC and Agreement State regulations and the
employer's procedures for radiation safety, routine and emergency operations, and to act in a professional manner
in matters pertaining to industrial radiography or to the ASNT certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification program also contains complaint and hearing procedures. For example, written allegations of
unauthorized practice by an ASNT-certified individual are reviewed by the ASNT Ethics Subcommittee. In some cases
a formal hearing may be held. If the ASNT Ethics Subcommittee determines that an unauthorized practice has been committed,
the subcommittee may take one of the following actions:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart covers items of a general nature, such as listing definitions and OMB approvals. It also describes the
purpose and scope of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.1, Purpose and scope, is basically unchanged from the existing regulation. Other NRC regulations that
apply to radiography licenses are referenced in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.3, Definitions, contains the following new terms: ALARA, Annual safety review, Becquerel, Certifying
entity, Collimator, Control (drive) cable, Field station, Gray, Independent certifying organization, Radiographer
certification, Radiation Safety Officer, Sievert, S-tube, and Temporary jobsite. These definitions were added
to define terms used in requirements not previously addressed in Part 34. The term ALARA, which means as low as reasonably
achievable, has been added to describe a key element of the revised part 20, ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation,''
that licensees must implement by January 1994. The term Annual safety review was added to describe this activity in
the proposed rule. The terms Becquerel, Gray, and Sievert were added to define the metric units used in all new or revised
regulations. The terms Certifying entity, Independent certifying organization, and Radiographer certification
were added to describe terms associated with revised requirements for verification of radiographer training. The
terms Collimator and Control (drive) cable were added to the proposed rule to describe pieces of equipment that is
often used in conducting radiography operations. The term S-tube was added to describe this component of a radiographic
exposure for which there are new requirements in the proposed rule. The terms Field station and Temporary jobsite
were added to clarify the meaning of these terms in the proposed rule. The term Field station is being used to designate
those locations where radiography equipment is stored and from which equipment is dispatched. The term Temporary
jobsite is being used to describe locations not authorized on the license where radiography is conducted. The term
Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) was added to describe the role of this individual in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms Associated equipment, Control tube, Exposure head, Field examination, Projection sheath, Radiographic
Operations, Shielded position, and Source assembly, while used in the existing regulation, were not previously
defined. Both licensees and Agreement State representatives requested clarification of these terms. Changing
the definition of radiographer's assistant was discussed at the November 1992 workshop in Dallas, Texas. Some Agreement
States use the term ``trainee'' to refer to a radiographer's assistant and require training similar to that required
of a radiographer. The NRC has decided to retain the term radiographer's assistant and has proposed upgrading the
training requirements to provide additional assurance that radiographers' assistants are sufficiently knowledgeable
of NRC regulations. Although the NRC is not adopting the term ``trainee,'' the proposed rule has been written to provide
the flexibility for the second person to have training beyond that of a radiographer's assistant. This position could
then equally be filled by a ``trainee.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of a permanent radiographic installation was modified to remove ambiguities in the previous definition.
The definitions of storage area and storage container were modified to remove references to transportation. Specific
transportation requirements are addressed in &sect;34.35.

Section 34.5, Interpretations, is standard regulatory language to state that only the General Counsel of the NRC
has the authority to provide interpretations of the regulations which will be binding on the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.8, Information collection requirements: OMB approval, is unchanged from the current regulation, except
for changing the section numbers to conform to the new format of the proposed rule and to list any new requirements that
require OMB approval. The Commission has submitted the proposed rule for OMB clearance. Final OMB clearance will
be obtained before publication of a final rule.

Subpart B_Specific Licensing Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed subpart provides the basic requirements for submittal of a license application. The sections in this
proposed subpart are basically unchanged from those in the current subpart A of part 34. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.11, Application for a specific license, is worded the same as &sect;34.3 in the current part 34. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.13, Specific license for radiography, has several changes from &sect;34.11 in the current part 34. A proposed
&sect;34.13(c) would specify requirements for establishing procedures to verify the certification status of radiographers.
The requirement for verifying an individual's certification would only apply to previously certified radiographers
whom a licensee might hire. A licensee would already know an individual's status if the individual is employed by the
licensee at the time of certification. However, the licensee would be required to ensure that all radiographers are
certified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.13(e) proposes a reduction in the frequency of field inspections of radiographers and radiographer's
assistants from quarterly to annually for individuals regularly conducting radiographic operations. For individuals
who have not performed radiographic operations for more than six months, an inspection of job performance would be
required at the time they next participate in a radiographic operation. This reduction is possible due primarily
to the proposed two-person rule, adoption of mandatory certification for radiographers, and upgraded radiographer
assistants training which would reduce the need for inspection of job performance. The basic requirements for conducting
the field inspections have been relocated to &sect;34.43(d) to more accurately reflect its role in the training program.
In addition, a requirement for conducting annual safety reviews has also been added in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;34.13(b)(1) and &sect;34.43(c) to clarify the intent of the current &sect;34.11(b) which requires periodic
training. Section 34.13(g) is proposed to require the licensee to designate an individual on the license to fulfill
the duties of the RSO. The qualifications and duties of this individual are specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;34.42. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.13(i) is a new paragraph which, as proposed, would require a list and description of all permanent radiographic
installations and all field stations to be included in the license application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.13(j) is a new paragraph which, as proposed, would permit licensees to have the option to use certified
radiographers before the proposed rule is adopted in final form and becomes effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart C_Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed subpart describes the requirements for radiographic equipment performance and use. Some of the requirements
in this proposed subpart are changed from the current part 34 as described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.20, Performance requirements for radiography equipment, is slightly changed from &sect;34.20 of the
current rule. Section 34.20(b)(3) is revised to prohibit modification of any exposure device. The proposed rule
was modified to remove any ambiguity regarding permission to modify safety components. The term Source assembly
was added to &sect;34.20 (c) and (e) to make clear that it is one of the pieces of equipment that must meet the requirements
of &sect;34.20. Section 34.20(f) is added to require labeling of all associated equipment acquired after January
10, 1996, to identify that the components have met the requirements of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.21, Limits on levels of radiation for radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, and source
changers, is basically unchanged from &sect;34.21 of the current rule with the following exceptions. Metric equivalents
to the values previously cited have been included. While it is recognized that radiation exposure instruments currently
use units of roentgens to measure radioactivity, the rule has been modified to use the terms millisieverts and millirems.
Rather than making the transition from roentgens to coulombs per kilogram (in air), the terms millisieverts and millirems
were chosen because a quality factor of 1 is appropriate in dealing with gamma-ray emitting radiography sources.
Under the proposed rule measurements taken in roentgens may continue to be recorded in terms of roentgens, provided
the limits described in the rule, expressed in millisieverts or millirems, are not exceeded.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 34.23, Locking and relocation of radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, and source changers,
is slightly changed from &sect;34.22 of the current rule, as described below. Section 34.23(a) describes locking
of radiographic exposure devices. A requirement to remove the key of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
keyed-lock is proposed. Should the key remain in the radiographic exposure device, there is an increased likelihood
of the accidental or intentional removal of the sealed source when the radiographic device is unattended. The word
``manually'' is added to clarify what is meant by securing the source assembly for radiographic exposure devices
manufactured before January 10, 1992. Section 34.23(b) is added which specifies requirements for ensuring that
the sealed source is in the shielded position before moving the device and associated equipment because a number of
overexposures have occurred while radiographic devices were being moved from one location to another. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.25, Radiation survey instruments, replaces &sect;34.24 in the current rule and has been updated to reflect
current calibration standards for different types of survey meters. This is to specify requirements to address the
variety of survey instruments currently available. An additional requirement to perform an operability check before
use is proposed. While this is routinely part of all survey instrument specifications, a failure to determine whether
an instrument was operable before use has been a contributing factor in overexposures during radiographic operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;34.27, Leak testing and replacement of sealed sources, the words ``repair, tagging, opening, and modification''
of sealed sources have been removed because these activities are only approved for individuals specifically licensed
to do so. It was never intended that radiographers would be permitted to perform these activities without special
authorization from the Commission or an Agreement State. Section 34.31 was modified to include a specific prohibition
on the opening, repair, or modification of sealed sources. Most of the language in the proposed rule is the same as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;34.25 of the existing rule. However, the organization has been modified for purposes of clarification. The
requirement that performance of a source exchange or a leak test must be done by persons approved by the Commission
has been modified to include Agreement States. Recordkeeping requirements have been moved to &sect;34.67. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.27(f) is proposed to require surveys for depleted uranium (DU) contamination in the ``S'' tube of radiographic
devices at least once every 12 months. Depleted uranium is used as a shielding material in most radiographic devices
and replaces the lead shielding that was used in older models. The presence of DU contamination in the ``S'' tube may
be an indication that the control cable has worn a groove through the ``S'' tube into the DU shielding. This condition
could cause binding of the control cable in the groove with the resultant inability to retract the source, and could
result in unwarranted exposures. Recordkeeping requirements may be found in &sect;34.67. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.29, Quarterly inventory, is basically unchanged from the existing regulation with the exception of moving
all recordkeeping requirements to &sect;34.69. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.31, Inspection and maintenance of radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, associated equipment,
and source changers, includes several proposed changes from &sect;34.28 in the current rule. The term associated
equipment has been included in the proposed rule, and includes various items used for specific tasks which may not
be supplied with the radiographic device. Experience has shown that defects in associated equipment can have an effect
on safety. Therefore, associated equipment must be included in an inspection and maintenance program. Section 34.31(a)
has been revised to clarify the intent of the daily visual check and the required actions if defects are found. In &sect;34.31(b),
the term routine maintenance is now used to clarify that licensees are not required to perform all maintenance. Many
equipment repairs may require returning the device to the manufacturer. Language has been added to specify that defective
equipment must be removed from service until repaired and that a record of the defect, as well as corrective actions
taken, must be made. While this appears obvious, there have been numerous instances where the use of defective equipment
continued and overexposures of personnel occurred as a direct result of the defects. Recordkeeping requirements
have been moved to &sect;34.73. The records required to be kept would now be specified in the rule, and include: Date
of check, individual performing check, equipment involved, any defects found, and repairs made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.33, Permanent radiographic installations, is basically unchanged from the existing requirements in
part 34, with the exceptions noted below. Section 34.33(a) has been revised to clarify which entrance controls are
required by incorporating the appropriate language from 10 CFR 20.1601 into part 34. Section 34.33(b) is revised
to require an alarm system check at the beginning of each day of use. This is to be performed by checking the warning light
and audible alarm with the source exposed before using the room each day. A defective alarm would require repair before
radiographic operations could resume. This requirement is included because there have been instances where failures
in alarm systems have resulted in personnel overexposures upon entry into a high radiation area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 34.35, Labels, storage, and transportation precautions, is a proposed new section that would place requirements
that specify labeling and security precautions for radioactive material storage and transportation in part 34.
Section 34.23 of the current rule describes storage precautions for exposure devices and storage containers but
does not address transportation or labeling requirements. In &sect;34.35 of the proposed rule, labeling requirements
for source changers and storage containers are specified. The proposed rule contains specific requirements to lock
and physically secure transport packages. The proposed rule would also require licensees to store licensed material
in a manner which minimizes the danger from explosions or fire. The requirement for a Quality Assurance (QA) program,
as described in &sect;71.105, has been added to the proposed rule. While radiography licensees have always had to
comply with &sect;71.105, there have been numerous cases where radiography licensees were unaware of this requirement
and, therefore, failed to comply. The addition of requirements addressing labeling and transportation is necessary
because in the past personnel and public exposures have occurred from the failure to properly safeguard radioactive
material during storage and transportation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart describes basic radiation safety requirements for radiographic operations and includes training,
safety procedures, personnel monitoring and surveys. New requirements describing the duties of the radiation safety
officer are proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.41, Conducting radiographic operations, would be added to address the practice of conducting radiography
at sites where the special safety features of a shielded facility are not available. The proposed requirement specifies
that, as a minimum, either two radiographers or a radiographer and an individual who has met the requirements to be
a radiographer's assistant must be present any time radiographic operations occur outside a permanent installation.
The basis for this proposed requirement is to ensure that, in the absence of the safety features outlined in &sect;34.33,
there will be a significant increase in assurance that operational safety measures will be implemented effectively.
The expectation is that violations involving failures to perform adequate radiation surveys of radiographic exposure
devices and the surrounding area, failures to adequately post and monitor the restricted area, and failures to lock
and secure the camera when not in use will become less frequent. Furthermore, if an incapacitating injury to a radiographer
should occur at a remote location, the presence of a second individual could be an important factor in preventing unnecessary
radiation exposures. Section 34.41(b) is proposed to require that radiographic operations conducted at locations
listed on the license be conducted in a permanent radiographic installation. If licensees would need to perform radiography
outside of a permanent facility due to some unique circumstances Commission authorization would be required, and
the requirements of &sect;34.41(a) would need to be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.42, Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), lists the qualifications and duties of the RSO. This section would
be added to place in the regulations the requirements for this key individual. Previously, these requirements were
referenced in regulatory guides and included as license conditions on a case-by-case basis, but not specified in
the regulations. The NRC believes that the RSO is the key individual for ensuring safe operations. The qualifications
listed for the RSO in the proposed rule include: (1) Completion of the training required for a radiographer as described
in part 34; and (2) 2000 hours of documented experience in industrial radiography with at least 40 hours of formal classroom
training with respect to the establishment and maintenance of radiation protection programs. It is anticipated
that most existing RSOs already meet these requirements. It is proposed that licensees would have two years from the
effective date of the rule to meet this 40 hour training requirement for existing RSOs. A key duty of the RSO is to ensure
the safe conduct of operations and to stop unsafe operations and institute corrective actions. Other duties of the
RSO in the proposed rule include overseeing procedure implementation and employee training, and monitoring radiation
surveys, leak tests, and personnel monitoring results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.43, Training, contains several new requirements. Section 34.43(a) has been revised to require radiographers
to be certified by a certifying entity meeting the criteria specified in Appendix A of the proposed rule. To be recognized
as a certifying entity, an independent organization meeting the criteria specified in part I of appendix A would have
to apply as specified in &sect;34.43(a)(2). Certifying programs would be periodically reviewed by the NRC to ensure
that the conditions of approval are being met. A list of approved certifying entities would be made available to licensees
on request by contacting the appropriate regional office listed in appendix D to 10 CFR part 20, and would be published
annually in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Under the proposed rule licensees would have 2 years to implement the proposed change. The change in the verification
of training requirements was included in the proposed rule to provide assurance of the quality of radiographers'
training in the safe handling of radioactive material. NRC and Agreement States must reciprocally recognize valid
radiographer certifications issued by either an independent certifying entity approved by the NRC or an Agreement
State certification program meeting the requirements of appendix A, parts II and III, of the proposed rule. Also included
in this section is training in &sect;&sect;30.7, 30.9, and 30.10, applicable sections of 10 CFR part 71, and some instructions
in applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations as referenced in 10 CFR part 71 in addition to other
parts of NRC regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.43(b), which lists training requirements for radiographers' assistants, has been revised to require
training in &sect;&sect;30.7, 30.9, 30.10, and parts 19, 20, 34, 71, and instructions in applicable DOT regulations
as referenced in 10 CFR part 71, in addition to the licensee's operating and emergency procedures. These changes are
to ensure that radiographers and radiographers' assistants are knowledgeable of the safety requirements applicable
to handling radioactive material in the conduct of radiography. In &sect;34.43(b)(3) the option of providing an
oral test has been omitted. The proposed rule would only allow a written test to be given. Section 34.43(c) describes
a proposed requirement to conduct annual safety reviews of radiographers and radiographers' assistants. In the
current rule, periodic training is required but required topics to be addressed are not included. Because a number
of violations involving personnel overexposures have resulted from licensees' failures to provide adequate training,
the proposed amendment for annual safety reviews includes training on revised operating and emergency procedures,
new equipment, and safety issues.

Section 34.43(d) has been relocated from &sect;34.11(d), and describes the requirements for routine inspections
of job performance for radiographers and radiographers' assistants. The proposed rule reduces the frequency of
these inspections from quarterly to annually. The NRC is proposing to reduce the frequency of inspections of job performance
for individuals regularly conducting radiographic operations. For individuals who have not performed radiographic
operations for more than six months, an inspection of their job performance would be required at the time of their next
participation in a radiographic operation. With several of the other requirements proposed in this rulemaking,
such as, certification of radiographers, and having at least two individuals at a temporary jobsite, the Commission
believes that the frequency of inspection of job performance can be reduced from quarterly to annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;34.43(e) specifies that recordkeeping requirements can be found in &sect;34.79. The requirements
for records are unchanged from the current part 34 except for the addition of records verifying the certification
status of radiographers. Proposed &sect;34.43(f) contains the subjects currently listed in Appendix A of part 34.
Several additional requirements are proposed. These include: Pictures or models of source assemblies; training
in storage, control, and disposal of licensed materials; and pertinent Federal regulations, i.e., Department of
Transportation. A new &sect;34.43(g) would be added which would allow licensees to continue to permit uncertified
individuals to act as radiographers for a 2-year period after the proposed rule becomes final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;34.45, Operating and emergency procedures, minor changes were made to include procedures for source recovery
if the licensee intends to perform emergency source recovery. These were added because many of the steps in a source
recovery would be the same in any circumstance and, in the past, a number of personnel overexposures have occurred
during emergency source recovery operations because basic radiation protection precautions were overlooked.
Additional requirements are proposed for transportation procedures to include placarding of vehicles, and reference
to the DOT regulations. A number of violations have resulted from licensees failing to follow DOT regulations in the
transportation of radioactive material. Section 34.45(b) is proposed which specifies that the recordkeeping requirements
can be found in &sect;34.81. Sections 34.89 and 34.91 specify that copies of current operating and emergency procedures
are to be maintained at field stations, permanent installations, and temporary jobsites, to ensure that adequate
documents are available where radiographic operations occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.46, Supervision of radiographers' assistants, is unchanged from &sect;34.44 of the current rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;34.47, Personnel monitoring, several changes are proposed. The existing requirement specifies that pocket
dosimeters have a range from zero to at least 200 milliroentgens. The proposed rule has dropped the term ``at least,''
to limit the range to be only from 0&hyph;200. This is to prevent the use of pocket dosimeters with very high ranges where
the users would be unable to properly determine their exposure. Use of pocket dosimeters with a range higher than 200
milliroentgens will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Additional requirements are proposed on the replacement
frequency for film and TLDs. The existing regulation does not specify the replacement frequency for film and TLDs.
The high intensity sources used in radiography necessitate frequent monitoring. Monthly replacement is judged
to be an appropriate frequency to adequately track an individual's exposure. With the new lower limits for occupational
dose, less frequent monitoring could result in a worker receiving an overexposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.47(b) addresses the use of pocket dosimeters. A requirement to read dosimeters at the beginning and end
of each shift is proposed. This is added to ensure that the dose is correctly estimated. The existing regulation only
specifies a daily reading and does not provide sufficient instruction on how licensees should handle any readings
which remain on the pocket dosimeter after recharging. Because it is nearly impossible to recharge a pocket dosimeter
to zero, licensees must take a reading before and after use and determine the difference to determine the dose accurately.
Section 34.47(d) addresses an off-scale pocket dosimeter. The proposed rule would require that, in the case of a pocket
dosimeter being off-scale, the individual will not be permitted to work with licensed material until the RSO or a designee
of the RSO makes a determination of the worker's radiation exposure. The current rule requires that the worker's film
badge or TLD be sent for processing, but does not specify when the individual can return to work. The proposed revision
provides the criteria that must be met before permitting the individual to return to work. A provision is included
which will permit the individual to return to work when the circumstances are clearly known and justified by the RSO
that there was no possibility of overexposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.47(e) is proposed to require that a worker cease work whenever a film badge or TLD is lost or damaged until
a replacement is available. This is added to ensure that there is a means to accurately determine the worker's radiation
dose.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 34.47(g) has a proposed revision to require alarm ratemeters to be capable of alerting the wearer regardless
of the environmental conditions. In a recent radiography overexposure incident, a licensee reported that a radiographer
who was wearing ear protection due to high workplace noise levels was overexposed because he was unaware that his ratemeter
was alarming. For use in high ambient noise areas, ratemeters could be supplied with either a vibrating alarm that
could be felt by the wearer or a small speaker built into hearing protectors to meet this requirement. NRC expects its
licensees to determine the need for alarm ratemeters that incorporate these additional protective measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;34.49, Radiation surveys, there are several proposed changes. The existing regulation requires a survey
of the circumference of the radiographic exposure device and the guide tube. A number of violations of NRC requirements
have occurred due to a failure to comply with the requirement to survey the full circumference of the camera. In reviewing
the regulation, the NRC has decided to revise the survey requirements to specify that a survey be conducted of the radiographic
exposure device to determine that the sealed source has returned to the shielded position, and specify that the radiographer
conduct a survey as he/she approaches the guide tube to exchange film, reposition the collimator, or dismantle equipment.
The proposed rule places the responsibility with the licensee for ensuring that an adequate survey is conducted.
In the majority of cases, a survey of the radiographic exposure device's ports should be adequate to make this determination.
A proposed requirement to survey storage areas when radioactive material is initially placed in storage, during
each quarterly inventory, and whenever changes occur which could increase radiation levels, is added.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.51, Surveillance, is basically unchanged from &sect;34.41 of the current rule. References to part 20

Subpart E_Recordkeeping Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart does not appear in the current part 34. This subpart is proposed to place all recordkeeping and notification
requirements in one location. Most of the recordkeeping requirements are unchanged from those contained in the existing
part 34. Proposed changes are discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.61, Specific license for radiography, requires the licensee to maintain a copy of the license until it
is terminated by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.63, Records of receipt and transfer of sealed sources, is added to provide a record showing the disposition
of sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.65, Records of radiation survey instruments, is proposed as currently written in Section 34.24. Licensees
would be required to maintain calibration records for radiation survey instruments for 3 years after the record is
made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.67, Records of leak testing and replacement of sealed sources is proposed as currently written in &sect;34.25(c)
and requires licensees to maintain records of leak tests for 3 years after the record is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.69, Records of quarterly inventory is proposed as currently written &sect;34.26 and requires licensees
to maintain records of quarterly inventories for 3 years after the record is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.71, Utilization logs, is proposed much as currently written in &sect;34.27. This section would require
licensees to maintain utilization logs for 3 years after the record is made. The proposed rule has added several additional
pieces of information to the logs including the serial number of the device in which the sealed source is located, the
radiographer's signature, and the dates the device is removed and returned to storage. This information is necessary
in order to verify location of sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.73, Records of inspection and maintenance of radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, associated
equipment, and source changers, is proposed much as currently written in &sect;34.28(b). This section requires
licensees to maintain inspection and maintenance records for 3 years after the record is made. The proposed rule would
specify the information that must be included in the inspection records: Date of check, name of inspector, equipment
inspected, any defects found, and repairs made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.75, Records of alarm system checks at permanent radiographic installations, is proposed as currently
written in &sect;34.29(c) and requires licensees to maintain records of alarm system checks for 3 years after the
record is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.79, Records of training, is proposed as currently written in &sect;34.31(c) with proposed additional
requirements for maintaining records of radiographer certification and annual safety reviews. This paragraph
would require licensees to maintain records verifying radiographer certification status. For annual safety reviews,
the records would include copies of tests, dates administered, names of instructors and attendees, and the topics
covered. Under the proposed rule, records of the annual inspections would include a list of items checked, and any
non-compliances observed by the RSO.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 34.81, Copies of operating and emergency procedures, is proposed as currently written in &sect;34.32 and
requires licensees to maintain copies of emergency and operating procedures until the Commission terminates the
license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.83, Records of personnel monitoring, is proposed as currently written in &sect;34.33(b), and requires
licensees to maintain records of alarm ratemeter calibrations, pocket dosimeter readings, and operability checks
for 3 years from the date the record was made, and to maintain records of film badge or TLD reports until the Commission
terminates the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.85, Records of radiation surveys, is proposed as currently written in &sect;34.43(d) and requires records
of the exposure device surveys for 3 years from the date the record was made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.87, Form of records, is proposed as currently written in &sect;34.4 and specifies how records must be maintained,
including permitting records to be stored in electronic media.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.89, Documents and records required at field stations and permanent installations, would be added to list
documents and records required at field stations and permanent installations. This section is necessary to ensure
that licensees have available sufficient records to demonstrate compliance with NRC regulations. Field stations
and permanent installations may be far removed from the home office. Therefore, records necessary to conduct operations
safely should be readily available. These records include a copy of the current license, copies of pertinent regulations,
copies of operating and emergency procedures, instrument calibration records, leak test results, inventory records,
utilization logs, training and survey records. These records are those required for licensees to safely handle radioactive
material, and are a subset of the records required at a licensee's normal place of business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.91, Documents and records required at temporary jobsites and use or storage locations exceeding 180 days,
would be added to list documents and records required at temporary jobsites and locations where radioactive material
will be in use or storage for more than 180 days. This section is necessary to ensure that licensees have available sufficient
records to demonstrate compliance with NRC regulations and those records necessary to maintain safe operations.
The records listed are a smaller subset of the records required for a field station or permanent installation. These
records include copies of pertinent regulations, evidence of latest instrument calibrations, latest survey records,
shipping papers, and NRC license or Agreement State license if operating under reciprocity. These records are those
required for licensees to safely handle radioactive material.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart is basically unchanged from &sect;34.30 with the exception of an additional requirement. Section 34.101(c)
would require licensees to notify the appropriate NRC regional office in writing before using or storing radioactive
material in one location for more than 180 days. This notification would be required within 30 days of exceeding the
180-day timeframe. This provision would be added to provide the NRC with information in a timely manner to permit inspection
of radioactive material at these locations.

Appendix A to Part 34 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This appendix is new. The requirements in appendix A to the current part 34 have been relocated to &sect;34.43(f).
Part I of the new appendix A provides the proposed requirements for an independent certifying organization, and does
not apply to Agreement States choosing to become a certifying entity. Parts II and III of the new appendix A provide
the proposed requirements for certification programs and written examinations for a certifying entity, which would
include Agreement States. The proposed appendix A would not impose new requirements on NRC's radiography licensees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC is proposing that an independent certifying organization would have to be a national society or association involved
in setting national standards of practice for industrial radiography or non-destructive testing to be recognized.
Membership in the organization could not be restricted because of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin
or handicap and the organization's certification program would need to be open to nonmembers. The independent certifying
organization would need to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Be incorporated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Have a permanent full-time staff; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Be nationally recognized; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Have a policy and decision-making review board; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Be governed by written organizational by-laws and policies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Have a viable system of financing its operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An independent certifying organization would also need to have: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A committee to review and approve certification guidelines and procedures and to advise the organization's staff
in implementing its certification program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A committee to review complaints against certified individuals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Written procedures describing its certification program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) An agreement to exchange information about certified individuals with the Commission and the Agreement States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a certification program to be acceptable, NRC is proposing that it include provisions requiring individuals
to receive training in the topics listed in &sect;34.43(f), complete a written examination, complete a practical
examination or equivalent, and require a minimum period of on-the-job experience. The program would also have to
include procedures that ensure due process whenever an individual's certification may need to be revoked, suspended,
or restricted for willful or significant failure to comply with his or her employer's operating or emergency procedures,
or the Commission's or an Agreement State's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the written examination, NRC is proposing that it be: (1) Designed to test knowledge and understanding of the subjects
listed in &sect;34.43(f); (2) written for a ninth-grade reading comprehension level; and (3) scientifically analyzed
to ensure that the questions are not biased or misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Agreement State Compatibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule will be a matter of compatibility between the NRC and the Agreement States, thereby providing consistency
between Federal and State safety requirements. With regard to basic radiation equipment specifications, standards,
and definitions identified as matters of Division 1 level of compatibility, the Agreement States will be expected
to adopt, essentially verbatim, the proposed part 34 standards and definitions into their equivalent regulations.
However, the NRC also recognizes that certain terms, such as radiographer's assistant, may not be used in present
Agreement State regulations. Continued use of alternative terms, such as ``trainee'' will be considered acceptable
so long as the underlying requirements of the position are consistent with those proposed by the Commission. The remainder
of the rule will be a Division 2 level of compatibility allowing the Agreement State regulators the flexibility to
adopt similar or more stringent requirements based on their radiation protection experience, professional judgments,
and community values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A of proposed 10 CFR part 34 provides the requirements for certifying entities to be acceptable to NRC. The
Commission reserves the right to make this determination and therefore this is a Division 4 item of compatibility.
Because it concerns a regulatory function that will be reserved for the Commission pursuant to 10 CFR part 150, the
Agreement States will not need to implement this provision of the proposed rulemaking. A new section proposed for
part 150 would make clear the Commission's intent to reserve this function and also to reserve the right to set minimum
radiographer certification standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agreement States that wish to develop radiographer certification programs would be expected to implement parts
II and III of the proposed appendix A. The definitions and the requirements for certification programs and written
examinations contained in this rulemaking must be the same for all NRC and Agreement State licensees to maintain consistency.
In practice, States that develop certification programs must develop regulatory language and regulations that
implement appendix A, parts II and III criteria. States would be permitted to include additional administrative
requirements (such as State-issued cards). States that do not develop certification programs would not be expected
to implement appendix A. NRC or an Agreement State must reciprocally recognize valid radiographer certifications
issued by either an independent certifying entity approved by the NRC or by an Agreement State certification program
meeting the requirements of appendix A, parts II and III, of the proposed rule. Agreement States would be expected
to submit their proposed program for NRC review and evaluation prior to implementing their certification program.

Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission intends to have different implementation dates for particular requirements of this proposed rule.
The proposed requirements would become effective 90 days after publication of the final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For the proposed requirements in &sect;34.41 to use, as a minimum, a two-person crew for radiographic operations
not conducted in a permanent facility, licensees would have 1 year from the effective date of the rule to comply. Licensees
would be required to affirm that all radiographers have met the certification requirements of 34.43(a)(1) within
2 years from the effective date of the rule. This would allow radiography licensees operating in NRC jurisdiction
2 years to obtain certification for their employees who act as radiographers. This requirement would include radiographers
employed by Agreement State licensees operating in non-Agreement States under reciprocity pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20.
The Commission notes that the State of Texas currently provides a 90-day grace period for non-Texas licensees operating
in that State under reciprocity (TRC 31.90). However, because this proposed rule will be a matter of compatibility,
the requirement for mandatory certification would apply to radiography licensees nationwide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensees would have one year from the effective date of the rule to comply with the additional training requirements
specified in &sect;34.43(b). Licensees could consider combining this training with the annual safety review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the proposed revision to &sect;34.47(g) that would require alarm ratemeters be capable of alerting the wearer
regardless of environmental conditions, licensees would have 1 year to obtain or modify a sufficient number of additional
alarm ratemeters to meet anticipated needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For use/storage locations not previously identified on the license (e.g., field stations, permanent radiographic
installations, and temporary jobsites exceeding 180 days) licensees must request amendments or notify the NRC,
as appropriate, by the effective date of the rule. Few amendment requests are anticipated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All current RSOs would be granted a two-year extension to meet the proposed additional RSO training requirements
specified in &sect;34.42(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission requests that persons commenting on this proposed rulemaking particularly address any hardships
that would result if the proposed rule were adopted and also address any hardships that would result if the proposed
implementation schedule were adopted. The NRC is particularly interested in suggestions for alternative implementation
schedules.

Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's
regulations in subpart A of 10 CFR part 51, that the rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action; therefore,
an impact statement is not required. The revision of 10 CFR part 34 should have no environmentally significant impact
because radiography only involves the use of sealed sources, and no environmental impact will be involved. The environmental
assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available for inspection
at the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington DC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has prepared an initial regulatory analysis of the impact of this proposed rule on small entities. A summary
of this analysis appears as Appendix A to this document. A copy of the analysis is available for inspection in the NRC
Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained
from Donald O. Nellis or Mary L. Thomas, Division of Regulatory Application, Office of Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Telephone (301)&hyph;492&hyph;3785. The NRC is seeking public comment on the
initial regulatory flexibility analysis. The NRC is particularly seeking comment from small entities (i.e., small
businesses, small organizations, and small jurisdictions under the Regulatory Flexibility Act) as to how the regulations
will affect them and how the regulations may be tiered or otherwise modified to impose less stringent requirements
on small entities while still adequately protecting the public health and safety. Those small entities which offer
comments on how the regulations could be modified to take into account the differing needs of small entities should
specifically discuss the following items: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The size of their business and how the proposed regulations would result in a significant economic burden upon
them as compared to larger organizations in the same business community.

Appendix A_Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Revision of 10 CFR Part 34 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations governing industrial radiography.
The proposed rule would include additional safety requirements to enhance the level of protection of radiographers
and the public and would clarify the regulations so that licensees may have a better understanding of what is expected
in radiographic operations. The proposed rule includes a number of updated radiography regulations that have been
adopted by many Agreement States. The format of the radiography regulations would be adjusted to place requirements
into descriptive categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The radiography industry in the United States consists of approximately 700 firms, employing about 20,000 individuals,
that perform radioisotope radiography either at fixed locations or at multiple temporary job sites. Of these firms,
approximately 200 are NRC licensees employing about 3,400 radiographers with an additional 2,000 radiography supervisors
and radiographers' assistants. This estimate is based on 1990 data for the number of individuals monitored for radiation
exposure to comply with 10 CFR Part 20. The industry uses an estimated 3,500 radiographic exposure devices that employ
either cobalt-60 or iridium-192 radioisotope sources. Roughly one-quarter of the firms conduct radiography at
a single location and the other three-quarters work at multiple locations generally referred to as temporary jobsites.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 90 percent are considered to be ``small entities'' under the criterion established in Section 605(b)
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. Most of the radiography licensees are in the business of non-destructive
testing in which radiography represents only a part of their total income. A few small firms work only in radiography.
Much of the work in the field involves the inspection of welds in bridges, oil, gas, and other pipelines and in the steel
framework of commercial buildings under construction so that the success and viability of the industry is closely
tied to the economic health of the country. NRC surveys indicated that 76 percent of NRC radiography licensees had
annual receipts of over $500,000, and most of the remainder had annual receipts exceeding $250,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605 (b)), the Commission believes that this rule
may, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to part 34 are intended to provide additional safety requirements to enhance the level of protection
of radiographers and the public and to clarify the regulations so that licensees may have a better understanding of
what is expected in radiographic operations. The proposed rule includes a number of radiography regulations which
have been adopted by the Agreement States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to part 34 can be grouped into major and minor impacts. Of the five major impacts, the proposed
requirement to have a second qualified individual at temporary jobsites may have a significant effect on small entities,
who would be more likely to use single-person crews. It should be recognized that under the current rule many licensees
already need to have, at least, two qualified individuals present at a temporary jobsite to maintain direct surveillance
of radiographic operations so as to protect against any unauthorized entry into the restricted area. Therefore,
this proposed requirement will only impact those operations where two individuals are not currently required. It
was assumed in the draft Regulatory Analysis that approximately 25 percent of NRC licensees who perform radiography
at temporary jobsites will need to hire and train additional staff to meet the proposed requirement. Other assumptions
used in the draft Regulatory Analysis were that each of these 50 licensees would need to hire 3&hyph;4 additional workers,
and that the cost of each assistant is $24,000 per year including benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other major impacts include mandatory certification requirements for radiographers, additional training
for radiographers' assistants, a specific requirement for a Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) who meets certain training
requirements, requirements for permanent installation alarms, and additional requirements for alarm ratemeters.
The estimated costs for all of these changes are significantly less than the costs associated with adopting the two-person
rule. The initial costs to certify radiographers is approximately $4080. The initial costs for each licensee to provide
an additional eight hours of training for radiographers' assistants is approximately $1,200. The initial costs
to provide the additional training required to meet the proposed RSO requirements is $3,700 per RSO. The initial costs
to install alarms in permanent installations is estimated to be $3,000. The initial costs to purchase additional
upgraded alarm ratemeters is estimated to be $1800. The other proposed revisions which are of a minor nature, would
result in initial costs of $700-$800 per licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed rule includes a reduction in the number of field inspections to be conducted, from quarterly
to annual. This reduction would lead to an estimated annual savings to each NRC licensee of approximately $16,000.
The proposed rule also includes a reduction in the frequency for radiation survey instrument calibrations from 3
months to 6 months. This reduction would lead to an estimated annual savings to each NRC licensee of approximately
$1400. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of these changes, the costs to adopt the two-person rule may have the most impact on a substantial number of ``small
entities''; however, the Commission believes that by requiring at least two qualified individuals to always be present
when radiographic operations are being conducted, there will be a significant increase in assurance that operational
safety measures and emergency procedures will be implemented effectively. The potential for a lowering of the risk
of unintended public exposure can be viewed as a potential cost savings to the industry. This proposed rule does not
duplicate or conflict with other Federal rules. No other alternative regulatory provisions that would minimize
the economic impact on small entities were considered.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. That action would have required modification of the automatic speed
brake control circuit. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reconsidered
its position on this safety issue and has concluded that the proposed modification is unnecessary to provide an acceptable
level of safety. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 17, 1993 (58 FR 48616). The proposed rule would have required modification of the automatic speed brake
control circuit. That action was prompted by a report of failure of a hydraulic pressure line to a landing gear truck
tilt cylinder, which resulted in inadvertent deployment of the automatic speed brake. The proposed actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were intended to prevent inadvertent in-flight operation of the automatic speed brake system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boeing requests that the proposal be withdrawn. Boeing notes that an AD was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued when the Boeing service bulletin (referenced in the notice) was released in 1971 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because, at that time, neither Boeing nor the FAA considered that there was an unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition addressed. Boeing has carefully examined the scenario of the incident of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadvertent deployment of the automatic speed brake that prompted issuance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, and finds that the incident did not occur during airline operations, but during a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boeing test flight. Specifically, the incident occurred while the airplane was conducting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``touch and go's'' (which are not allowed in airline operations), which allowed the landing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gear trucks to move out of the fully tilted position and initiated extension of the automatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speed brake. The pilot immediately recognized this and retracted the spoilers manually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(On Boeing Model 747 series airplanes equipped with triple slotted flaps, once the spoilers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are retracted, the hydraulic flow redirects to the flaps immediately, and the lift is regained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with minimal altitude loss.) Boeing points out that, during this incident, the reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6-foot loss in altitude occurred when the airplane was at around 100 feet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Boeing asserts that the reason for issuance of its service bulletin, containing procedures for installing
the modification of the automatic speed brake control circuit, was not only to add better protection for the circuit,
but to minimize the ``pitch up'' on the ground during landing. If the number four hydraulic system (which powers the
inboard spoilers) is inoperative, a ``pitch up'' would occur with outboard spoilers only. Boeing asserts that the
pilot can easily compensate for this condition by using his/her hand and the speed brake levers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the information discussed above, Boeing requests that the proposal be withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the FAA acknowledges that issuance of the notice was based on a recommendation of the
Systems Review Task Force (SRTF). The SRTF has completed an extensive review process to ``*&blank;*&blank;* determine
possible design concepts that will provide alternative means of control of flight critical functions in the event
of total loss of all (normal) redundant systems which provide that control *&blank;*&blank;*'' The SRTF's charter
was specifically oriented toward identifying alternative means to ensure controllability of airplanes that have
lost all normal flight control functions, while maintaining basic airplane structural integrity. The SRTF recommended
incorporation of the modification described in Boeing Service Bulletin 27&hyph;2066, Revision 1, dated August
20, 1971, which was referenced in the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, after further study of the Boeing service bulletin and its intent, the FAA has determined that failure to
incorporate the modification described in that service bulletin does not degrade the flight safety of the airplane.
While the modification adds logic to prevent uncommanded deployment on touchdown for airplanes equipped with auto
speed brakes, the effects of such deployment can be readily rectified by manually retracting the spoilers. Although
the installation of the proposed modification would add additional protection against inadvertent deployment
of the speed brakes and thereby minimize the pitch up on the ground as a result of such deployment, this condition does
not cause loss of hydraulics, does not affect airplane symmetry, and does not significantly degrade airplane flight
controllability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon further consideration, the FAA has determined that this condition does not present an unsafe condition that
would warrant the proposed mandatory corrective action. Accordingly, the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from
issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore,
is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model
F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect cracks of certain demountable
flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies and of the bolt bosses on certain demountable flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies,
and modification or replacement, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by reports of cracks and broken spokes found
on certain main wheel assemblies of these airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent loss of a main wheel assembly during takeoff or landing.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that
several operators of Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes have reported finding cracks and broken spokes on certain
main wheel assemblies, part number 5008131&hyph;4. Investigation revealed that the manufacturer of these wheels
had discontinued a shot-peening procedure that was part of the manufacturing process prior to April 1991. Subsequently,
an improved shot-peening procedure on the mating surfaces of the inboard wheel subassemblies was introduced in October
1992. However, this procedure was not introduced on the outboard wheel subassemblies until February 1993. Consequently,
a number of units were produced that are prone to fretting and cracking due to a lack of shot-peening of the assembly
mating surfaces and bolt bosses. This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of a main wheel assembly during
takeoff or landing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker has issued Service Bulletins SBF100&hyph;32&hyph;070, dated January 18, 1993, and SBF100&hyph;32&hyph;073,
dated September 10, 1993, which reference Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation (ABSC) Service Bulletins Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;46,
dated December 24, 1992, and Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;48, dated March 10, 1993, as the appropriate sources of service
information. The RLD classified these Fokker service bulletins as mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness
Directive (BLA) 93&hyph;009/3 (A), dated June 1, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes
in the Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ABSC Service Bulletin Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;46 describes procedures for eddy current inspections to detect cracks
of certain demountable flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies; and, if no cracks are found, modification and subsequent
inspections of the subassemblies; and, if cracks are found, replacement of the subassemblies with serviceable parts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ABSC Service Bulletin Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;48 describes procedures for eddy current inspections to detect cracks
of the bolt bosses of certain demountable flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies; and, if no cracks are found, modification
of the subassemblies; and, if cracks are found, replacement of the subassemblies with serviceable parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive eddy current inspections to detect
cracks of certain demountable flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies and of the bolt bosses of certain demountable
flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies, and modification or replacement, if necessary. Replacement of a cracked
wheel subassembly terminates certain repetitive inspections required by this AD. The actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the ABSC service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 87 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
14 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection and modification, and that the average labor rate
is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $66,990, or $770 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed
requirements of this AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

This proposed rule would revise and update the procedures governing the imposition and adjudication of program sanctions
predicated on recommendations of State Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organizations (PROs). These
changes are necessitated by statutory revisions addressing health care fraud and abuse issues and the OIG sanctions
process. In addition, this proposed rule also sets forth new appeal and reinstatement procedures for practitioners
and other persons excluded by the OIG based on a PRO recommendation.

The Medicare Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) program was established to ensure that
Medicare beneficiaries receive medical care that meets professionally recognized standards. Section 1156 of the
Social Security Act (the Act) sets forth specific statutory obligations imposed on practitioners and other persons
to furnish necessary services meeting professionally recognized standards. The statute also authorizes the Secretary,
based on a PRO's recommendation, to impose sanctions (exclusion from Medicare and any State health care program participation
as defined under section 1128 of the Act or a monetary penalty) on those who fail to comply with the statutory obligations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the PRO sanction process, no practitioner or other person is recommended for exclusion or the imposition of
a monetary penalty until the PRO provides the opportunity for extensive discussion with the practitioner or other
person, and the opportunity to provide additional information. After receipt of a recommendation from a PRO, the
Office of Inspector General (OIG) excludes, or imposes a monetary penalty, only after a careful review of all the documentation
submitted and a separate determination that the practitioner or other person has violated the statutory obligations
to render only medically necessary and appropriate care that meets professionally recognized standards or has failed
to provide evidence of medical necessity and quality, and is unwilling or unable to comply with those obligations.
A practitioner or other person who is excluded from Medicare and any State health care programs as defined in section
1128(h) of the Act, or assessed a monetary penalty, on the basis of a PRO finding is entitled to administrative and judicial
review after the exclusion is imposed or the monetary penalty is assessed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Prior to the enactment of Public Law 100&hyph;93 (the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of
1987), section 1156 of the Act set forth obligations of practitioners and other persons providing care to Medicare
patients to provide care that was medically necessary and appropriate that meets professionally recognized standards
of quality, and appropriately documented. It also provided for the exclusion from Medicare of practitioners and
other persons who, upon the review and recommendation of a PRO, were found to have violated those obligations. Section
6 of Public Law 100&hyph;93 extended those obligations to encompass all health care services for which payment may
be made under the Act, and not just Medicare. Further, the exclusion authority was extended to encompass violations
occurring in, and exclusions from, Medicaid, the title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, and the title XX Social
Services Block Grant programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4095 of Public Law 100&hyph;203, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987, amended section 1156
of the Act to provide that an exclusion of a health care practitioner or other person who practices in a country of less
than 70,000 people or in a rural health professional shortage area (HPSA) cannot be effectuated until an opportunity
is provided for a preliminary administrative hearing. The purpose of this preliminary hearing is to determine whether
the practitioner's or other person's continued program participation, through the conclusion of the administrative
proceedings on the merits of the exclusion, would place beneficiaries at serious risk. In accordance with section
1156(b)(5) of the Act, unless the administrative law judge (ALJ) at the preliminary hearing determines that the practitioner
or other person will pose a serious risk to Medicare beneficiaries if permitted to continue furnishing such services,
the exclusion of a rural practitioner or other person may not be effectuated until they are given an opportunity for
an administrative hearing on the merits of the exclusion itself.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4205 of Public Law 101&hyph;508, OBRA 1990, set forth new statutory requirements with respect to PRO sanction
activities. Specifically, the statutory amendments require PROs, if appropriate, to offer a corrective action
plan to practitioners and other persons prior to making a finding under section 1156 of the Act; and require the Secretary
to consider, in determining whether a practitioner or other person is willing and able to comply with his, her or its
obligations, whether the practitioner or other person entered into and successfully completed a corrective action
plan prior to the PRO's submission of its recommendation and report to the Secretary.

A. Inclusion of the OBRA 1990 Provisions Relating to PROs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 29, 1992, the OIG published a final rule (57 FR 3298) setting forth amendments to the OIG's exclusion and
civil money penalty (CMP) authorities resulting from Public Law 100&hyph;93. Specifically, that final rule revised
&sect;1004.130 of the regulations and deleted &sect;1004.100(g) in its entirety to be consistent with the establishment
of a new part 1005_Appeals of exclusions, civil money penalties and assessments_which now governs ALJ hearings and
subsequent appeals to the Secretary for all CMP and other OIG sanction cases.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The revisions to 42 CFR part 1004 of that final rule were meant only to conform the regulations to new statutory changes
resulting from OBRA 1990, and were not meant to be a comprehensive rewrite of part 1004. This regulation sets forth
a more complete and comprehensive rewrite of this part. Among other revisions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;These proposed regulations would eliminate the current procedural distinction between ``substantial''
violations and ``gross and flagrant'' violations. This is an artificially created procedure that has no basis in
law or legislative history to provide a distinction between the two types of violations. Experience in processing
these cases has shown that the second meeting is just a repeat of the first meeting since the present regulations preclude
any new violations identified in the second meeting as serving as the basis for a sanction recommendation. Under these
proposed regulations, which are consistent with a recommendation from the Administrative Conference of the United
States, an opportunity would be provided for a meeting with the PRO and to provide additional information. The regulations
would also provide that any violations of the obligations that are identified during a corrective action plan period
would be used to support the PRO's recommendation regarding unwillingness or inability to comply with the statutory
obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;These proposed regulations also codify the agreement reached among the American Medical Association, the
American Association of Retired Persons, the Health Care Financing Administration, and the Office of Inspector
General with regard to PRO physicians involved in the sanctions process. Under this agreement, no physician member
of the PRO panel may be in direct competition with, or have a substantial personal bias against, the practitioner or
other person being considered for sanction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1004.30(e) of these proposed regulations would provide instructions to the PROs on the actions to
be taken when a physician relocates after receiving a sanction notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Among the factors considered by the OIG in imposing an exclusion, in addition to the practitioner's or other
person's previous sanction record, are any prior problems that such person has had with the Medicare carrier or intermediary.
We are now proposing to include as an additional factor any prior problems that any State health care program has had
with such practitioner or other person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The current language of &sect;1004.90(b)(1) concerning the OIG's review responsibilities (that would now
be designated as &sect;1004.100(b)(1)) would be modified to state that the OIG will review the PRO report to determine
whether the PRO followed the ``regulatory requirements of part 1004.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The existing definition of the term ``physician'' appearing in &sect;1004.1 would be deleted in order to conform
with the HCFA definition of this term.

B. Preliminary Hearings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
These proposed regulations would amend part 1004 by allowing a practitioner or other person in specified rural areas
or counties of a specified population to request a preliminary hearing when notified of an exclusion from participation
in the Medicare program by the OIG as a result of a PRO recommendation under section 1156(b) of the Act. The preliminary
hearing would be solely on the issue of whether such practitioner's or other person's continued participation in
the program during the appeal to an ALJ would place program beneficiaries at serious risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for entitlement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Entitlement to such a preliminary hearing would apply to providers or practitioners for whom an exclusion is proposed
who practice in a rural Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) for their specialty or in a county with a population
of less than 70,000. For purposes of this entitlement, a practitioner's or other person's practice is where over 50
percent of his, her or its services are rendered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health professional shortage areas are designated by the Secretary and are defined in regulations at 42 CFR 5.2. Since
HPSAs are not specifically designated by rural or urban classifications, we are proposing that any HPSA not located
in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) would be considered a rural HPSA for purposes of these regulations. Both
section 1886(d)(2) of the Act and regulations at 42 CFR 412.62(f) use these MSAs as the basis for determining an urban
area or rural area for computing Medicare prospective payment rates. Although Public Law 100&hyph;203 divided the
definition of urban into large urban and other urban areas, it did not change the differentiation between urban and
rural. Therefore, we are proposing to classify any HPSA not located in a MSA as rural.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are seven different HPSA specialty categories. These HPSA specialty categories are described in current regulations
at 42 CFR part 5, Appendices A through G, and include primary medical care, dental, psychiatric, vision care, podiatric,
pharmacy and veterinary manpower. In determining eligibility for a preliminary hearing, we are proposing to use
these categories for all practitioners and other persons to whom they apply. For all practitioners not covered by
the specialty categories, we are proposing to use the ``primary medical care'' specialty category for determining
eligibility for a preliminary hearing. This means that any practitioner who practices a specialty other than those
identified in 42 CFR part 5 will be regarded as practicing in a rural HPSA only if that area is designated as an HPSA for
``primary medical care.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``primary medical care'' category will also be used for all other persons and facilities, e.g., hospitals, with
the exception of those ``other persons'' qualified under the ``psychiatric'' manpower category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information on a county's population size would be obtained by the OIG from the responsible officials of that county.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Timeframes for hearing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The proposed regulations provide that a practitioner's or other person's request for a preliminary hearing must
be received within 15 days of receipt of an OIG exclusion notice. Once such a request is received, the preliminary hearing
is to be held and a decision rendered on the ``serious risk'' issue within 45 days. In those cases where the ALJ grants
a stay of the exclusion, a full hearing must be held and a decision rendered within six months. These timeframes developed
for the ALJs are intended to balance the right of a ``rural'' practitioner or other person to receive timely due process
against the OIG responsibility to ensure that substandard or unnecessary health care services are not provided to
program beneficiaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Sanctions Notification Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1156(b)(2) of the Act requires reasonable notice to the public of a sanction action being taken against a practitioner
or other person based on the PRO's recommendation. Under the current implementing regulations, when a sanction action
is taken by the OIG against a practitioner or other person, the OIG is required to notify the general public of such action.
This notice to the public specifically identifies: (1) The sanctioned practitioner or other person; (2) the obligation
that has been violated by this person; (3) the specific sanction action imposed; and (4) if the sanction is an exclusion,
the effective date and duration of this action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this public notification process has worked well in most instances, we believe the present publication procedure
may not always yield the most effective results of informing affected parties and program beneficiaries of a specific
sanction action taken under the program. As a result, we are considering permitting practitioners and other persons
to select an alternative method of notification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations would amend 42 CFR part 1004 to offer sanctioned health care practitioners and other persons
the option of informing all their patients directly of a sanction action taken against them. If they select this option
and comply with its requirements in a timely fashion, this compliance would constitute public notice and would replace
the public notice currently published by the OIG. Among other things, a practitioner or other person opting for this
method of notification would be required to certify to the Department that they have undertaken to inform all their
patients of the action taken and, in the case of exclusion, that they will notify new patients before furnishing services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Method of direct notification of patients by practitioner or other person
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We considered a variety of methods for practitioners and other persons to notify and inform patients of a sanction
action. For example, we considered having the sanctioned party (1) post a sign in his, her or its office; (2) verbally
communicate the information to patients when they called for an appointment or came to an office visit; or (3) send
written notification to each of his, her or its patients. After evaluating the options, we believe that the first two
methods indicated above would not effectively meet the proposed requirement that all existing patients be informed
within 30 calendar days since it is unlikely that all of these patients would make an appointment or come for an office
visit in the specified period. In addition, the Department would be unable to verify that the proper information had
been adequately conveyed to the patients if either of the first two notification methods were selected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We, therefore, propose that each sanctioned practitioner or other person opting for this alternative notification
procedure alert both his, her or its existing patients and all new patients through written notification based on
a suggested (non-mandatory) model that will be provided to the sanctioned individual by the OIG. If the sanctioned
party is a hospital, the hospital would be required to notify all physicians having privileges at the hospital, as
well as post a sign in its emergency room, business office and in all affiliated entities regarding its sanction. (Practitioners
and other persons must also notify all new patients orally at the time an appointment is set to provide services, as
well as provide written notification to such patients at the time they arrive to see the provider for treatment or services.)
We believe that only through this method can the OIG assure that all patients are properly informed of a sanction action.

Certification of notice to patients.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the sanctioned practitioner or other person chooses to use the alternative notification approach, he, she or it
would be given 30 calendar days from receipt of the notification from the OIG to return an OIG-prepared certification
form stating that: (1) He, she or it has informed each of their existing patients that a sanction has been imposed; (2)
if excluded from Federal programs, the program will not pay for items and services ordered, furnished or prescribed
by the practitioner or other person and that this ban will remain in effect until the practitioner or other person is
reinstated; (3) if excluded, he, she or it will provide this information, prior to providing services, to any new patient
seen until he, she or it is reinstated; and (4) he, she or it certifies to the truthfulness and accuracy of the notification
and the statements in the certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Non-election of the alternative method of notification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the sanctioned practitioner or other person does not elect this alternative method of notification of informing
his, her or its patients and returning the certification form within the proposed 30-day period, the OIG would follow
its standard procedure for public notification, which consists of notifying the public directly of the identity
of the sanctioned practitioner or other person, the obligation that has been violated, and the effective date and
duration of any exclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Failure to comply with alternative method of notification after electing such method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the sanctioned practitioner or other person elects the alternative method of notification by returning the certification
form within the proposed 30-day period, but the OIG receives reliable evidence that such practitioner or other person
has not adequately informed his, her or its new and existing patients of the sanction, the OIG would follow its standard
procedure for public notification as described above. Once a practitioner or other person has elected the alternative
notification option by returning the certification form to the OIG, his, her or its failure to follow through and fully
comply with the notification requirements will be considered adversely at the time of his, her or its application
for reinstatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that patient notification is enforced and provided in a timely manner so that patients are not at
risk of receiving poor quality of care, we are soliciting comments on how best to enforce this provision. Under this
proposed approach, when the OIG learns through patient complaints or other forms that the practitioner or other person
has not fully complied, the IG at that point may additionally consider specific action to remedy the situation, such
as pursuing penalties for the filing of a false statement. Comments on this alternative notice process and on whether
this enforcement approach is reasonable and effective are specifically invited.

A. Regulatory Impact Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget has reviewed this proposed rule in accordance with the provisions of Executive
Order 12866. As indicated above, the revisions contained in this proposed rule are intended to revise and update administrative
procedures governing the imposition and adjudication of program sanctions, based on PRO recommendations, against
practitioners and other persons who violate the statute. We believe that the great majority of practitioners and
other persons do not engage in such prohibited activities and practices, and that the aggregate economic impact of
these provisions should, in effect, be minimal, affecting only those who have engaged in prohibited behavior in violation
of statutory intent. As such, these regulations should have no direct effect on the economy or on Federal or State expenditures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. While some sanctions and penalties may have an impact on
small entities, we do not anticipate that a substantial number of these small entities would be significantly affected
by this rulemaking. Therefore, since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would
not have a significant economic impact on a number of small business entities, we have not prepared a regulatory flexibility
analysis.

returns the certification within the 30-day period but the OIG obtains reliable evidence that such person nevertheless
has not adequately informed new and existing patients of the sanction, the OIG will see that the public is notified

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The ALJ cannot consolidate the preliminary hearing with a full hearing without the approval of all parties to the
hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) The preliminary hearing will be conducted by an ALJ of the DAB in a city that the ALJ deems equitable to all parties.
The ALJ will conduct the preliminary hearing and render a decision no later than 45 days after receipt of the request
for such a hearing by the DAB. Date of receipt by the DAB is presumed to be 5 days after the date on the request for a preliminary
hearing, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary. A reasonable extension to the 45-day period of up to
15 days may be requested by any party to the preliminary hearing and such a request may be granted upon concurrence by
all parties to the preliminary hearing. Such request must be received no later than 15 days prior to the scheduled date
of the preliminary hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The only issue to be heard and decided on at the preliminary hearing is whether the practitioners's or other person's
continued participation in the Medicare and State health care programs during the appeal of the exclusion before
an ALJ would place program beneficiaries at serious risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) In the interest of time, the ALJ may issue an oral decision to be followed by a written decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) In those cases where the ALJ has stayed an exclusion after a preliminary hearing, a full hearing must be held and
a decision rendered by the ALJ within 6 months. If, for any reason, the request for a full hearing before the ALJ is withdrawn
or dismissed, the exclusion for the period that has not been served will be effective 5 days after the notice of the withdrawal
or dismissal is received in the OIG headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The preliminary hearing decision is not appealable or subject to further administrative or judicial review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A practitioner or other person found at the preliminary hearing not to place program beneficiaries at serious
risk, but later determined to have been properly excluded from program participation after a full hearing before
an ALJ, is not entitled to have the exclusion stayed further during an appeal to the DAB. Exclusions in such instances
will be effective 5 days after receipt of the ALJ decision in the OIG headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6)(i) After notice of a timely request for a preliminary hearing, the OIG may determine that the practitioner's or
other person's continued program participation during the appeal before the ALJ will not program beneficiaries
at serious risk and waive the preliminary hearing. Under these circumstances, the exclusion will be stayed pending
the decision of the ALJ after a full hearing. The hearing must be held, and a decision reached, within 6 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the OIG decides to waive the preliminary hearing, the request for the preliminary hearing will be considered
a request for a hearing before the ALJ in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Right to administrative review. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A practitioner of other person dissatisfied with an OIG determination, or an exclusion that results from a determination
not being made within 120 days, is entitled to appeal such sanction in accordance with part 1005 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Due to the 120-day statutory requirement specified in &sect;1004.100(e), the following limitations apply_

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The period of time for submitting additional information will not be extended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any material received by the HHS after the 30-day period allowed will not be considered by the ALJ or the DAB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The OIG's determination continues in effect unless reversed by a hearing.

Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FTA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 9, 1993, at 58 FR 64856, concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the creation of a State oversight agency that would develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain procedures for overseeing the safety of rail fixed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guideway systems. FTA has determined that a public hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would help in the development of the final rule. FTA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly will hold the hearing in conjunction with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference sponsored by the American Public Transit Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(APTA), which will be attended by State and local transit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives. The hearing will be held on March 8, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of this action, FTA is extending the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Information on the Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hearing will be held on March 8, 1994, in the Grand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ballroom_Salon D at the J.W. Marriott Hotel, 1331 Pennsylvania 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20004. It will begin at 8 a.m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(EST). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those interested in providing comments on the NPRM may respond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in writing to the docket or participate in the public hearings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are encouraged to do both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FTA has established the following procedures to facilitate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearings. Those wishing to participate in the public hearings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should contact either Mr. Franz Gimmler or Mr. Roy Field by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
telephone at (202) 366&hyph;2896, by fax at (202) 366&hyph;3765, or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing at the address in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section at least three business days before the hearing is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held or register with the FTA on the day of the hearing. Those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contacting FTA at least three business days before the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is scheduled may request a particular time to testify. FTA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will try to accommodate those requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those who have not contacted FTA at least three business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days in advance, a registration desk will be available at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing site on the day of the hearing. Individuals may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
register beginning one hour before the hearing is scheduled to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
start. The registration desk will remain open until the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begins, after which FTA staff will try to accommodate late 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registrants. Time permitting, individuals will testify in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order in which they have registered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those who request to testify may be given ten minutes to make a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement or present other relevant documents which will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the docket. FTA encourages those individuals to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a written statement which will also be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those individuals in need of an oral interpreter should inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Gimmler or Mr. Field of that need also at least three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business days before the hearing is to be held. Unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested three business days before the hearing, an oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A hearing officer will preside over the hearing. The hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer may make a statement to clarify issues or facilitate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion during the hearing . Any statements the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer makes during a hearing are not intended to be and should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be construed as a position of the FTA with respect to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM or any future rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will be recorded by a court reporter. A transcript 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the hearing will be included in the official rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Docket 92&hyph;D and be available for inspection. Any individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested in a copy of the transcript of a hearing may contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the court reporter directly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing is designed to solicit public views and information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the NPRM. Therefore, the hearing will be conducted in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informal and nonadversarial manner. However, the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer may ask questions in order to clarify statements made at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hearing. To facilitate comment and get a broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross-section of views, the FTA may ask some of those who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
register in advance to participate on a panel during the hearing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to approve a postsecondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education institution to participate in the student financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance programs authorized by Title IV of the HEA (Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs) and many other Federal programs, the Secretary must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of an ``institution of higher education.'' Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA and other Federal statutes, one element of that definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires an eligible institution of higher education to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to the quality of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or training provided by the institution. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element requires an eligible institution to be legally authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide an educational program beyond the secondary level in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State in which it is located. Thus, the statutory definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an institution of higher education provides the framework for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a shared responsibility among accrediting agencies, States, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate'' to the Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs is opened to only those institutions that provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students with quality education or training worth the time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy, and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sharing this responsibility have traditionally been referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as ``the triad.'' While the concept of a triad of entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, the triad has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not always worked as effectively as it should to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational quality, nor has it served as an effective deterrent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to abuse by institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. For several years, certain institutions participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Title IV, HEA programs have failed to provide students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with education or training of an acceptable level of quality; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they have also failed to treat students fairly. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they have failed to meet acceptable standards of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility and administrative capability and to adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect Title IV, HEA program funds entrusted to them. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that have engaged in these abusive practices are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restricted to a particular sector of higher education. Rather, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the abuses have been found in all types of institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating in the Title IV, HEA programs, including those in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the private non-profit and public sectors of higher education as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as those in the proprietary sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, gatekeeping functions have not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried out effectively. For example, some accrediting agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or training provided by the institutions or programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they accredit or to protect student interests when they accredit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular institutions or programs. Moreover, some States have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or training provided by the institutions they authorize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or license to operate in the State or to protect student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interests. Finally, the Federal government's management of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities to determine eligibility and to certify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always been adequate to prevent abusive practices at institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that participate in those programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consequently, in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;325, (the Amendments of 1992), Congress provided for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity Triad.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under that part, States and accrediting agencies are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assume major new oversight responsibilities, and States, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting associations, and the Secretary are linked to create 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate or wish to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the most appropriate approach to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinated evaluation of institutions by the three components of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the triad is a complementary one with each component focusing its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation on its obligations within the context of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or training provided by the institutions or programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they accredit. For States, which already had responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining that institutions have the legal authority to operate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the State, the HEA added a new focus: reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that trigger certain statutory review criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of institutions is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative and financial capacity of those institutions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute allocates legal responsibility among the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities that compose the program integrity triad. While the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific statutory responsibilities for the three triad entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may overlap, when viewed as a whole the triad brings together in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a coordinated fashion three different but very important aspects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of institutional review. Within this statutory scheme, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has sought to assure that the gatekeeping system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operates as efficiently as possible, with maximum integration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among the three triad entities and without unnecessary burden on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postsecondary institutions. In order to assist the Secretary in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designing a final regulation that achieves these goals, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary specifically requests comment on the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In several areas, the statute specifically requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each triad entity to evaluate an institution under the same or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar standards. For example, a SPRE and an accrediting agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may establish different standards for evaluating the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility of an institution or for evaluating the success of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution's educational program. Thus, a reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would need to satisfy the SPRE's and the accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's standards even though those standards address the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. How should final regulations be structured to both reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the burden on institutions and enable the triad entities to carry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out effectively their statutory functions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should final regulations be more explicit in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying levels, characteristics, or definitions for any of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assessment or review criteria that a triad entity is expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consider in its evaluation of an institution? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 1 of part H creates a new program, the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postsecondary Review Program, or SPRP, under which State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oversight of institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs is strengthened. Subpart 2 of part H establishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures and criteria under which the Secretary recognizes an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency as a reliable authority as to the quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the education or training offered by institutions that the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accredits. Lastly, subpart 3 specifies the procedures the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary uses to determine whether an institution meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility requirements and has the administrative capacity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility to administer the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 24, 1994, the Secretary published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the NPRMs to implement the SPRP provisions in subpart 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of part H of the HEA (59 FR 3604) and the accrediting agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in subpart 2 of part H of the HEA (59 FR 3578). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's publication of this NPRM prior to the publication of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final regulations implementing the SPRP and accreditation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions provides the Department of Education an opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinate all comments received on the triad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of subpart 3 that pertain to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional eligibility requirements found in 34 CFR part 600 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been addressed in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 10, 1994, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes changes to 34 CFR part 600. This NPRM addresses those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of subpart 3 that pertain to subparts A and B of 34 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR part 668. Subpart A contains definitions applicable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs. Subpart B contains requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial and continued participation in the programs. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular, the following provisions in this NPRM address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of subpart 3: Proposed &sect;&sect;668.15 and 668.16 delineate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards for the evaluation of an institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility and administrative capability, respectively, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by section 498(a), (c), and (d) of the HEA. Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.15 also codifies the definition of persons who exercise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial control of an institution found in section 498(e) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HEA. Proposed &sect;668.12 addresses the requirements of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
498(b) of the HEA that requires the Secretary to develop a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application form to be used by institutions that wish to apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Proposed &sect;668.13 includes the provisions governing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement of financial guarantees from owners found in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
498(e) of the HEA, addresses the provision that requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to establish a schedule for the expiration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs found in section 498(g) of the HEA, and codifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions governing provisional certification of institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in section 498(h) of the HEA. Pursuant to sections 498(g) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (h) of the HEA, proposed &sect;668.26 delineates the date that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's period of participation would end, when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's period of participation expires, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's provisional certification is revoked.

The Amendments of 1992 amended the HEA in several areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to the participation of institutions in the Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs. The Student Assistance General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations contain requirements that are common to educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following list summarizes the major issues in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Each participating institution is subject to a new statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of an academic year in which a full-time student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(with respect to an undergraduate course of study), during a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum 30-week period, must complete: At institutions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure program length in credit hours, at least 24 semester 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or trimester hours or 36 quarter hours; or at institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that measure program length in clock hours, at least 900 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock hours. Section 668.2 proposes to clarify the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in the statutory definition of academic year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The statute now mandates the definition of an eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program for proprietary institutions of higher education and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postsecondary vocational institutions, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``short-term'' programs (at least 300 but less than 600 clock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours) that would be eligible for the FFEL programs only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute requires that these programs must have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion and placement rates of at least 70 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured in accordance with regulations. Section 668.8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes methodologies for those measurements. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary eventually may propose a single methodology (based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on comments on this NPRM, regulations to implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Student Right-to-Know Act, and other NPRMs) to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wherever appropriate in regulations for the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. In accordance with the statute, this NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains further provisions to evaluate the quality of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, specifically a requirement proposed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary that a program may not exceed by more than 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent the minimum number of clock hours required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State for training in the recognized occupation for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program prepares students, and a requirement that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program be in existence for at least one year before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying for eligibility under these criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;This NPRM proposes to add two new sections to codify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures with regard to applications to participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initially or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program (proposed &sect;668.12) and procedures by which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary certifies that an institution meets the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in subpart B of these regulations and accordingly may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in a Title IV, HEA program (proposed &sect;668.13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;668.13 also includes proposed procedures whereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary codifies new statutory provisions governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisional certification procedures for participation in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program. Provisional certification permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to allow an institution that otherwise would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not qualify to participate in a Title IV, HEA program to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate on a limited basis. The institution is subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to shorter periods of participation than a fully certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution and does not have the right to the extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal proceedings under subpart G of the Student Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Provisions if the Secretary revokes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's provisional certification. Instead, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed by the Secretary in this NPRM, the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be offered a modified appeal. Further, an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is provisionally certified may be monitored more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closely to the extent that the Secretary believes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution warrants a greater degree of oversight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 668.14 proposes to amend the regulations governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreements to include numerous new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions added by the Amendments of 1992 and provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously prescribed by the HEA but not specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spelled out in the regulations. This section also includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions proposed by the Secretary. This NPRM proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement statutory requirements regarding disclosure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revenues and expenses for institutions that offer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
athletically related student aid. This NPRM would also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address statutory requirements concerning incentive payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based directly or indirectly on success in securing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollments or financial aid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;This NPRM proposes significant changes to &sect;668.15 (currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.13) the section governing the evaluation of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial responsibility. The NPRM proposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to strengthen the factors used to evaluate an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility and to reflect statutory changes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the provision that requires that any standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed for the determination of an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility take into account any differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accounting principles between for-profit and nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. For example, this NPRM proposes to require a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for-profit institution to have a ratio of current assets to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current liabilities of 1.25:1 and a nonprofit institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1:1. As the statute requires the establishment of cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserves sufficient to ensure repayment of any required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunds, the NPRM also proposes to require each institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to maintain a minimum cash reserve of at least 10 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's total deferred tuition income at the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the institution's most recent fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;This NPRM proposes, in &sect;668.16 (currently &sect;&sect;668.14 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
668.15) to strengthen and expand the standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability for participating institutions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressing areas previously not regulated or for which there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were only guidelines, such as: The maximum time frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed in the standards for satisfactory academic progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for completion of a student's educational program and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expansion of standards to include those general areas that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be reviewed by State postsecondary review entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(SPREs). The SPRE review areas are included because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas may have a significant bearing on an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability and thus should be considered as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary reviews the administrative capability of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the NPRM does solicit comments on whether these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional proposed standards should be implemented across 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the board or be made applicable only to institutions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet specific criteria or thresholds, e.g., institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with short-term programs and institutions with a history of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative problems. For example, this section of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM includes the proposed requirement that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that offers a vocational program of less than two years in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length that prepares students to enter recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupations must demonstrate that the borrower's increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual expected earnings, based on completion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, will exceed the annual amount of Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program assistance received for the programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The provisions in proposed &sect;668.17 (currently &sect;668.15) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing default reduction measures reflect statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes made by the Amendments of 1992 and current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
departmental practices. The provisions in the Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1993 that address institutional appeals of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rates are not included in this NPRM and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be addressed separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;As mandated by statute, all participating institutions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to implement a fair and equitable refund policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This statutory provision is similar to the requirement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fair and equitable refunds prescribed by the FFEL program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations for institutions that participate in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. Section 668.22 proposes to clarify the terms used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the statutory definition of a fair and equitable refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy. The NPRM also proposes to mandate a refund policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Appendix A) that an institution must use to calculate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's refund if the student is not entitled to a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund and an institution's State and accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency do not have specific refund standards. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of a new statutory provision that specifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order of return of refunds to the Title IV, HEA programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other sources of aid without regard to the amount of aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received from State or private sources, this NPRM proposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to remove the fraction that is currently used to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the portion of the refund attributable to the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs and that attributable to other sources of aid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In accordance with the statute, institutions will now be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to have compliance audits every year rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every two years, as required by current regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.23 proposes to allow institutions that do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pose a great financial risk to the Title IV, HEA programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., institutions that received less than $100,000 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total annual funding under the Title IV, HEA programs or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not had deficiencies identified in their most recently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted audit reports) to submit audits biennially. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, under this proposal, an institution would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to submit a compliance audit for any year in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total Title IV, HEA program funds it received were less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than $25,000. This section also proposes to extend audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements to foreign institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM also contains a proposed change to the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pell Grant Program regulations. This NPRM proposes to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 487(c)(7) of the HEA that provides that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may offset the amount of Title IV, HEA program disbursements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against liabilities or may receive reimbursement from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department for those amounts if, in the course of any audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted after December 31, 1988, the Department discovers or is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informed of any Title IV, HEA program assistance (specifically, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Pell Grant Program funds) that an institution has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to its students in accordance with program requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but the institution has not previously received credit or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement for these disbursements. Although this provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relates directly to the Federal Pell Grant Program and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed to be included in the Federal Pell Grant Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, it is contained in Part G of the HEA and is subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the negotiated rulemaking process explained below. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it has been included in this NPRM instead of the Federal Pell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant Program NPRM, which was not subject to the negotiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under new section 492 of the HEA, these proposed changes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the negotiated rulemaking process, which includes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for the Secretary to convene regional meetings to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain public involvement in the development of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Accordingly, issues related to these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes were discussed in meetings held in September 1992 in New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York City; San Francisco; Atlanta; and Kansas City, Missouri. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these meetings, the Secretary provided the attendees with a list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of issues to be addressed in these proposed regulations. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary of the responses of the attendees is contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix to this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Groups that attended the regional meetings nominated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals to participate in the regulation negotiations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary selected regulation negotiators from the names 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominated and chose negotiators to reflect all the groups that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, such as students, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student financial aid administrators, and various types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations also address statutory changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;208 (the Technical Amendments of 1993). Those areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by the Technical Amendments of 1993 are identified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the discussion of regulatory changes. The Secretary notes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statutory changes required by the Technical Amendments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 are not subject to the negotiated rulemaking process of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 492 of the HEA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 492(b) of the HEA, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared draft proposed regulations and negotiated the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that draft with negotiators. The great majority of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed changes do not reflect consensus reached at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations (as consensus was rarely obtained). The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has identified in the discussion of changes the areas where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consensus was reached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion reflects proposed significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to the existing Student Assistance General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and the Federal Pell Grant Program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed changes are discussed in the order in which they appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the proposed regulatory text. If a provision applied to more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than one section or is included in more than one section, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to its other appearances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to revise this section to remove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vocational school from the list of what the term institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes, because vocational schools are no longer eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions under the HEA. The Secretary proposes to revise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section to reflect a listing of currently existing Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs that would be subject to part 668. Programs added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the list would include the National Early Intervention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scholarship and Partnership, Presidential Access Scholarship, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Direct Student Loan programs. The Income Contingent Loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program, which no longer exists, would be removed from the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These revisions reflect statutory changes made to the HEA by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1992.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes definitions proposed in NPRMs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51716), and on February 17, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994 (in part II) (59 FR 8044). Those definitions are:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official, initiating official, output document, show-cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
third-party servicer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeat the discussion of those definitions here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to remove the definitions of

 because they would be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 34 CFR part 600, governing institutional eligibility under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA. The Secretary proposed to move these definitions to 34 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 600 in the NPRM published on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6446). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is proposing technical changes to clarify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions of the current Title IV, HEA programs and to add 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions of the newly authorized Title IV, HEA programs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform with statutory changes and for consistency with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminology used in the individual program regulations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary also proposes to make technical changes in the

hundred clock hours at an institution that measures program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length in clock hours. The definition delineates not only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum amount of work that a full-time student enrolled in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undergraduate educational program is expected to complete during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an academic year, but also the minimum period of time over which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the work in any educational program must be completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Amendments of 1993 specify that this provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is only applicable with respect to an undergraduate course of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study. The Secretary expects that institutions would continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use their own academic standards, within the framework of current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program regulations, to determine the amount of work full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
graduate and professional students are expected to complete over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a minimum of thirty weeks of instruction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum time period specified is thirty weeks of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructional time. The Technical Amendments of 1993 further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended section 481 of the HEA definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic year 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that the Secretary may reduce, for good cause on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case-by-case basis, the 30-week minimum to not less than 26 weeks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of instructional time in the case of an institution of higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education that provides a 2-year or 4-year program of instruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which it awards an associate or baccalaureate degree. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has been unable to determine a definition of ``good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause'' that would justify using this authority. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary is concerned that regulatory standards for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions would encourage many institutions to seek that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment routinely and this implementation would result in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inequitable treatment of Federal student aid recipients from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to institution. Further, the Secretary is concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that widespread implementation would result in increased costs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV, HEA programs. Therefore, the Secretary has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed specific criteria to implement this technical amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at this time. The Secretary requests comments on a definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``good cause'' and ways of implementing this provision through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that address the Secretary's concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has determined that the terms used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic year
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 must be clarified if the definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to be well-understood and applied consistently. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining what constitutes the 30-week period, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would count the period that begins on the first day of classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and ends on the last day of classes or examinations. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, if an institution's first day of classes begins on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tuesday, the first week of the academic year would begin on that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tuesday and end the following Monday. The institution would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begin counting with the Sunday preceding the first day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that, for purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
week
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be a consecutive seven-day period, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to a five-day or six-day 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
school week
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or seven individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days that are spread out over more than one calendar week. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach would facilitate counting and readily accommodate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that start and end on different days of the week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this definition, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
week of instructional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be any week in which at least one day of regularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled instruction, examinations, or preparation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination occurs. The Secretary recognizes that there may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain weeks during an academic year during which fewer than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five days of instruction occur. An institution should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibited from counting those weeks in its 30-week period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided at least one day of regularly scheduled classes occurs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in each of those weeks. Further, this proposal would accommodate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovative educational programs such as those offered only on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weekends or condensed schedules. At the same time, the proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not open the door to abuse, because regardless of the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of days of study that occur in any week, an institution must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
still provide enough instruction for a full-time student to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to earn the minimum number of credit or clock hours needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet the definition. Finally, the Secretary would make clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution cannot count, as instructional time, periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consisting purely of noninstructional activities, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orientation, counseling, or vacations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It should be noted that because the statute specifies both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of work expected to be completed and the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timeframe for an academic year for use in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, an institution might need to prorate or adjust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program assistance for its students. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the span of time from the first scheduled class at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning of the school year until the last examination at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of the school year (excluding any weeks that consist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusively of vacation time and all other activities not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly related to instruction, preparation for examinations or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations) is twenty-five weeks, the institution would need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make adjustments in accordance with individual program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Because summer sessions generally would not be long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough to constitute the equivalent of a complete semester or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarter, as they are under various current program regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program funds awarded for summer sessions would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to be adjusted to reflect the lengths of the sessions. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive discussion of the potential effect of this new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of academic year on Federal Pell Grant calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be found in the NPRM on the Federal Pell Grant Program to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published shortly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Full-Time Student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes it is necessary to have a definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
full-time student
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that is applicable to all Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. A definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
full-time student
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is needed because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic year
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is based, in part, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workload of a full-time student, and because the term is used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elsewhere for other purposes in part 668. The Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed a definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
full-time student
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that would be based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a slightly modified definition found in the Federal Pell Grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the campus-based program regulations. This definition also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would incorporate parts of the definition of full-time student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in the FFEL program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, the Secretary proposes to define a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an enrolled student who is carrying a full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic workload (other than by correspondence) as determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution under a standard applicable to all students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled in a particular educational program. In determining a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's workload, an institution would be permitted to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combinations of courses, work, research, or special studies that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution considers sufficient to classify the student as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time student. Under this proposal, for an undergraduate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student, an institution's minimum standard must equal or exceed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 12 semester hours or 12 quarter hours per academic term in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational program using a semester, trimester, or quarter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system; (2) 24 semester hours or 36 quarter hours per academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year for an educational program using credit hours but not using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a semester, trimester, or quarter system (or the prorated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent for a program of less than one academic year); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 24 clock hours per week for an educational program using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition also provides for a method for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time status for students enrolled in an educational program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using both credit and clock hours. In order to evaluate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined workload of the student, an institution could determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time status based on the sum of the proportionate workload 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried in terms of credit hours and the proportionate workload 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried in terms of clock hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, an undergraduate student could be considered a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time student if he or she undertakes a series of courses or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seminars that equals at least 12 semester hours or 12 quarter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours in a maximum of 18 weeks. For cooperative education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, an undergraduate student could be considered a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time student if the work portion of a cooperative education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program in which the amount of work performed is equivalent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the academic workload of a full-time student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is particularly interested in establishing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standard for a full-time academic workload for students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who receive funds under the FFEL programs. Currently, for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of those programs, an institution determines what a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time academic workload is for these students. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that, because no minimum requirement for an academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workload of a full-time student exists under the FFEL programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is the potential for abuse of FFEL program funds through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of the definition of an academic year. For example, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution might have educational programs that are measured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit hours and do not use academic terms. The institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could claim that it offers a full academic year's worth of work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over a thirty-week period by giving a full-time student a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of instruction, which the institution claims to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to 24 semester or 36 quarter hours. This situation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would result in the receipt of an inordinately large amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL program funds for the amount of work actually accomplished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary requests comments on whether, to further address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this potential abuse, he should also establish a weekly minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time workload for educational programs that are measured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit hours but do not use academic terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

undergraduate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

to this section. Because the proposed definition of a

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
full-time student 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

is used in other places in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
undergraduate student 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in this part. The proposed definition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition currently found in the Federal Pell Grant and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
campus-based program regulations. The Secretary proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
undergraduate student 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as a student enrolled in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undergraduate educational program at an institution who has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earned a baccalaureate or first professional degree. The student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to be enrolled in an undergraduate educational program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that usually does not exceed 4 academic years, or a 4- to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5-academic-year program designed to lead to a first degree. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student enrolled in a program of any other length would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered an undergraduate student for only the first four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic years of that program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations would remove the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in &sect;668.8(a)(1) (i) through (iv), which govern the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational qualifications of persons admitted into an eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. These qualifications are appropriately addressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34 CFR 600.4 through 600.6, which govern the types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that may be eligible to apply to participate in HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The educational qualifications of eligible students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Title IV, HEA programs are also addressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.7(a) (3) and (b). Therefore, these provisions are no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed for purposes of defining an eligible program. Note that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other provisions governing the admission requirements needed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain educational programs to qualify as an eligible program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are discussed further below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations would clarify a number of the terms used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine an eligible program. Proposed &sect;668.8(b)(1) would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
equivalent of an associate degree 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as either an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associate degree, or the successful completion of at least a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-year program that is acceptable for full credit toward a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bachelor's degree and qualifies a student for admission into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third year of a bachelor's degree program. This definition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed because educational programs offered by a proprietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution of higher education or a postsecondary vocational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may qualify as eligible programs depending, in part, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on whether the programs admit students with the equivalent of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associate degree (see the discussion on minimum program lengths). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition is based on the provision in section 1201(a)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HEA that qualifies institutions offering 2-year transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs for institutional eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reason (that the terms are needed to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the eligibility of programs offered by proprietary institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of higher education and postsecondary vocational institutions_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
see the discussion on minimum program lengths) the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to define 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
week 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
week of instruction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency, these terms would be the same as those proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used in &sect;668.2 for the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic year. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are discussed in detail there. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that short-term programs (those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offering less than 600 clock hours) that are eligible under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulations because they met the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that used to be in section 435 of the HEA, will cease to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be eligible when the final regulations governing programs become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective, unless those short-term programs are able to satisfy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations. Short-term programs that were not offered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not eligible before July 23, 1992 can only become eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when final regulations become effective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the minimum length of an eligible program. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 481(b) of the HEA, a proprietary institution of higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or a postsecondary vocational institution must, to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible, provide an eligible program, as defined in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
481(e) of the HEA. Proposed &sect;668.8(d) would implement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition. The proposed definition would supplant the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory definition of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
six-month training program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in 34 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 481(e) of the HEA provides for three types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible programs. The first type of eligible program is one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that must provide at least 600 clock hours, 16 semester or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trimester hours or 24 quarter hours of instruction offered during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a minimum of 15 weeks. The program must provide undergraduate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training that prepares a student for gainful employment in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized occupation. The program may admit as regular students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons who have not completed the equivalent of an associate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second type of eligible program is one that must provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 300 clock hours, 8 semester hours, or 12 quarter hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of instruction offered during a minimum of 10 weeks. The program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must provide training that prepares a student for gainful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment in a recognized occupation and be a graduate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional program or admit as regular students only persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who have completed the equivalent of an associate degree. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first time, this type of program may qualify for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all Title IV, HEA programs, not just the FFEL programs, as under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third type of eligible program would qualify for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL programs only. It must provide at least 300 but less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600 clock hours of instruction offered during a minimum of 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks. The program must provide undergraduate training that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares a student for gainful employment in a recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupation, and admit as regular students some persons who have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not completed the equivalent of an associate degree. This type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of program must also satisfy regulations of the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing placement rates, completion rates, and other criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rates and criteria are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 481(e)(2) of the HEA requires the third type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible program to have a verified completion rate of at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
70 percent and a verified placement rate of at least 70 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with the Secretary's regulations and to meet other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria specified by the Secretary in regulations. Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.8(e) would implement these provisions. Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.8(e)(2) would require an institution to substantiate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of its completion and placement rates by having its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent auditor who prepares its compliance audit report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;668.23 verify the accuracy of the calculations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that the auditor's assurance of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations would be a reliable independent substantiation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary also believes it is practical for an auditor to check 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this information, inasmuch as he or she is already on site to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform the institution's required compliance audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.8 would include formulas in paragraphs (f) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) for calculating the appropriate completion and placement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates. The Secretary believes a single methodology is desired, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and invites comments in this area. The Secretary notes that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM implementing the Student Right-to-Know provisions in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
485(a) of the HEA, which addressed the calculation of completion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or graduation rates, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 10, 1992 (57 FR 30826). The Secretary will be publishing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second NPRM for implementation of the Student Right-to-Know 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions shortly after publication of this NPRM to further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address this calculation. The Secretary would also like to know 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if any proposals relative to the Student Right-to-Know Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding graduation and completion rate calculations should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used instead of the methods proposed here. The proposed formulas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be based on the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Award Year
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All calculations would be based on enrollments, completions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and placements during an award year. Thus, an applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion or placement rate would be the rate as it existed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of a particular award year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculation of Completion Rate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An institution would base its calculation on the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of regular students who were enrolled in the program during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award year. The rate calculation is based on regular students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because those students by definition intend to complete a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. The Secretary believes that inclusion of other students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not provide an accurate picture of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The institution would subtract from the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular students the number of those students who, during that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award year, withdrew from, dropped out of, or were expelled from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program and were entitled to and actually received in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely manner in accordance with &sect;668.22(i)(3) a refund of 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of their tuition and fees (less any permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative fee) under the institution's refund policy. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that the inclusion of students who have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received a 100 percent refund at an institution would unduly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalize the institution because these students would not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participated in the academic component of an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. These students are excluded from the calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because there would not be a loss of Title IV, HEA program funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Department of Education if the institution has refunded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all tuition and fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The institution would subtract the number of students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who were enrolled in the program at the end of that award year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The institution would determine the number of regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who, during that award year, received the degree, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate or other recognized education credential awarded for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successfully completing the program.

(5) The institution would divide the number determined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
item (4) by the total obtained under item (3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed methodology instructs institutions to subtract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the denominator all students who were enrolled in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program at the end of the award year without regard to any time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frame established for the completion of the program. In view of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fact that the Secretary is addressing the effect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expectation that a student complete a program in a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time on the calculation of completion rates in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forthcoming NPRM concerning the Student Right-to-Know provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 485(a) of the HEA, the Secretary particularly invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on whether that expectation should also be considered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calculation under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculation of Placement Rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An institution would determine the number of students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who, during the award year, received the degree, certificate, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other recognized educational credential awarded for successfully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completing the program. The Secretary believes it would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fair or accurate to include in the placement rate calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those students who have not yet completed the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The institution would subtract from the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students described in item (1) the number of those students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were employed by the institution either before or after their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of the degree, certificate, or other recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational credential. The Secretary believes that excluding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees of the institution will help curb abuse by those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schools who may hire their own students in order to increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement rates. The Secretary specifically requests comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether there are methods of distinguishing legitimate hiring by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution of its graduates or students from hiring simply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improve the results of a placement rate calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Of the total obtained under item (2), the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would determine the number of students who, within 180 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the day they received their degree, certificate, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized education credential, obtained gainful employment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recognized occupation for which they were trained or in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related comparable recognized occupation and, on the date of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation, are employed or have been employed for at least 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that only students who have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed within 180 days should be counted in the calculation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes 180 days because it is consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum period of time that a payment on a student's loan under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FFEL loan program may be deferred. These FFEL deferments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include provisions for deferments for periods of unemployment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary considers this time frame to be adequate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable, and provides ample time for an institution to place a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation allows an institution to include in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its placement rate a student who is placed in a recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupation which is comparable and related to the occupation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the student has been trained. For instance, if a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were trained as an auto mechanic, he could be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement rate calculation if he were placed as a boat mechanic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if a student completed a retail sales management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, he could not be included in the calculation if he were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed as a counterman at a fast food establishment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be included in the placement rate, a student must have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been employed for at least 13 weeks following graduation from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. The Secretary believes that this requirement will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
help stem abuse by institutions that may arrange to have students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hired for short term jobs in order to boost placement rates. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed 13-week period is consistent with the period of time a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student must be employed to be counted in the calculation of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's placement rate under the procedures delineated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current &sect;668.15(g) for the appeal of an institution's loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation due to an unacceptable cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, for purposes of this calculation, a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has up to 180 days after he or she receives his or her degree, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate, or other recognized education credential to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gainful employment and then must be employed for at least 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary understands that, because of the total length of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time allowed for obtaining and maintaining employment, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's calculations may not accurately reflect placement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results for programs that are offered in the latter half of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award year. The Secretary specifically requests comments on ways 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to address this issue.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) The institution would divide the number of students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined in item (3) of this section by the total obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under item (2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The institution must maintain documentation that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student described in item (3) above, obtained gainful employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an occupation for which he or she was trained or in a related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupation. Examples of satisfactory documentation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's gainful employment include, but are not limited to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A written statement from the student's employer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Signed copies of State or Federal income tax forms; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Written evidence of payments of Social Security taxes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that requiring institutions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collect this data will help curb abuse by institutions that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overstate their placement rates in order to achieve and maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for short-term programs. Furthermore, to further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid potential abuse, the Secretary proposes that in certifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the accuracy of an institution's placement rate, as required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;668.8(e)(2), the institution's auditor should review the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above types of documentation collected by the institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify each student's inclusion in the placement rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute provides that the Secretary may prescribe other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to determine the quality of these programs. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;668.8(e)(1)(iii), to be eligible, programs less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600 clock hours in length may not exceed by more than 50 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the minimum number of clock hours required for training in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized occupation for which the program prepares students, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the State in which the program is offered, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State has established such a requirement. For example, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State requires security guard students to complete only 300 clock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours of training, a security guard program in that state will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be eligible if it exceeds 450 clock hours. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes this regulation will help curb abuse of the programs by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventing institutions from providing unnecessary training to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students in order to receive additional Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;668.8(e)(1)(iv) requires that to be eligible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs less than 600 clock hours must have been in existence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for at least one full year. The Secretary believes that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time frame is necessary so programs may demonstrate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate completion and placement rates. Institutions will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under 34 CFR 600 to apply for eligibility of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs after the one-year requirement is satisfied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the elements already in place in the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations regarding English as a Second Language (ESL) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, &sect;668.8(j)(2) proposes that in order for an ESL program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be eligible, the institution must test each student at the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the program to substantiate that the student has attained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate proficiency in written and spoken English to use already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing knowledge, training or skills. The institution will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also be required to identify the test it gives to the students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the basis for the judgment that the student has attained the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate proficiency. This proposal, based on California law, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was suggested during the negotiation process as a method to stem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abuse by institutions which offer ESL programs. As established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the current regulations, ESL programs which qualify as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible programs are eligible for purposes of the Federal Pell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant program only. This provision remains unchanged.

Section 668.12&blank;Application Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to add a new &sect;668.12 to codify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's current practices with regard to applications to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. This section also would include proposed procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whereby the Secretary codifies new statutory provisions governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications to participate or to continue to participate in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498(b) of the HEA requires the Secretary to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a single application form to be used by an institution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wishes to apply to participate or to continue to participate in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program. The statute requires that this form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for the collection of various information and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation. First, the form must require an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide sufficient information and documentation to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the requirements of institutional eligibility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accreditation, and the capability of the institution are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the form must require an institution to describe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between a main campus of an institution and all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its branches. In particular, the form must require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to include a description of the student aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing that is performed by the main campus and that which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed at its branches. Third, the form must require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to describe all third-party servicers of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution and supply a copy of any contract with a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer. Finally, the form must require an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide any other information that the Secretary determines will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to eligibility, accreditation, administrative capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and financial responsibility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the Department of Education uses a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application form that addresses both institutional eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements (as found in 34 CFR part 600) and the standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification of administrative capability and financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. In recent years, although institutions filed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single application form, they received separate notifications of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action from the Department: an institutional eligibility notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a certification letter. This created confusion because some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions misinterpreted the institutional eligibility notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also to be the notice informing the institution that it met the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for ``certification'' and that the institution was now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to participate in a Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to reduce confusion, the Secretary is now combining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these notices of ``institutional eligibility'' and ``certification'', 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuing one ``Institutional Approval Notice'' to an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that meets the institutional eligibility and certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. The Institutional Approval Notice advises the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that it is an eligible institution, and is approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs listed in the Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and indicated in the institution's program participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. The effective date of approval, which is specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Institutional Approval Notice, is the date that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signs the institution's program participation agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current practice, an institution that wishes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in a Title IV, HEA program for the first time must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first apply to the Secretary for a certification that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution meets the standards for participation found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B of these regulations. A currently participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must apply to the Secretary for a certification that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution continues to meet these standards under a number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the institution must apply for certification if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requests the institution to apply. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserves the right to require a participating institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply at any time if the Secretary is concerned about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's continued participation in a Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the Secretary exercises this authority only rarely, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and generally when the Secretary receives reliable information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that could affect the institution's eligibility under 34 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600 or the institution's financial responsibility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability under subpart B of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if the Secretary receives information that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that does not grant degrees has received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization from its State and accrediting agency to award 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degrees, the Secretary would require the institution to apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 34 CFR part 600 to determine whether the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfies the definition for a different type of institution and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore might be eligible to apply to participate in HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs for which the institution earlier was not qualified. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same time, the Secretary requires the institution to apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for recertification under this subpart. Similarly, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary receives reliable information that could affect whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution meets the factors of financial responsibility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this subpart, the Secretary requires the institution to apply for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recertification. The Secretary does not intend to exercise this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority more frequently than under current practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, a participating institution must apply for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification if the institution wishes to include in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation a branch campus (as that term would be defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34 CFR part 600) or another location that offers 100 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational program. Adding a branch campus or additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location that offers 100 percent of an educational program can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a great effect on the ability of an institution to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers it is appropriate to scrutinize the effect of such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition. In particular, the Secretary believes it is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to examine whether the institution has the financial resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the administrative capability necessary to support such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of circumstances that could affect an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program do not, under
the Secretary's current practice, require the institution automatically to apply for recertification under subpart
B of these regulations. Instead, these circumstances require the institution to notify the Secretary, and, if necessary,
provide specified information about the circumstances. These circumstances parallel many of those described in
34 CFR part 600 requiring the institution to notify the Secretary of changes that could affect the institution's eligibility.
Based on that notification and information, the Secretary determines whether the institution must apply for recertification.
If the institution need not apply, the Secretary notifies the institution under the provisions of 34 CFR 600.30 that
the institution continues to be eligible and participating. If the Secretary needs further information to make that
determination, the Secretary requests additional information from the institution or requires the institution
to apply for recertification. These procedures apply to the following circumstances: (1) A change in name, address,
or location of the institution or one of the institution's locations; and (2) the inclusion in an institution's participation
of a location that offers less than 100 percent but at least 50 percent of an educational program. In making the determination
that the institution must apply for approval, the Secretary takes into account the institution's ability to provide
adequately education or training at the location, including such factors as the percentage of an educational program
offered at the location and the financial and administrative capability of the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current practice and under these proposed regulations, a participating institution that wishes to include
in its participation a location that offers less than 50 percent of an educational program need not provide any notification
or application to the Secretary, unless the Secretary so requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, a participating institution must apply for certification if the institution wishes to continue to participate
in a Title IV, HEA program following a change in ownership that results in a change in control. The regulations governing
institutional eligibility (34 CFR part 600) contain the requirements governing institutions that change ownership
resulting in a change of control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New section 498(g) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish a schedule for the expiration of the approval of institutions
to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. Once this schedule is in place, each program participation agreement
will have a specific expiration date. To continue participating in the Title IV, HEA programs beyond the expiration
date of its program participation agreement, an institution will need to apply for and be granted approval for continued
participation. The Secretary will notify an institution well in advance of the expiration date of the institution's
program participation agreement that the institution must apply for and be granted continued participation. If
an institution does not apply for or is not granted approval for continued participation by the expiration date of
the institution's program participation agreement, the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs
would expire on that expiration date. In this case, the Secretary may choose to provisionally certify the institution.
Provisional certification will be addressed in more detail later in this discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would specify that an institution that applies for participation in any Title IV, HEA program
must apply on the form prescribed by the Secretary and provide all information and documentation requested by the
Secretary. The Secretary would like to clarify that an institution may be asked to supply additional information
in support of its application after its initial submission. This does not represent a change from current procedures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 668.13&blank;Certification Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the Secretary informally refers to the procedures by which the Secretary certifies that an institution
meets the standards in subpart B of these regulations and accordingly may participate in a Title IV, HEA program as
the ``certification procedures.'' The Secretary proposes to add a new &sect;668.13 to codify these procedures.
This section also would include proposed procedures whereby the Secretary codifies new statutory provisions governing
certification and provisional certification procedures for participation in a Title IV, HEA program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Clearly, an institution may not be certified unless the institution is eligible under the provisions of 34 CFR part
600. Further, this section would make clear that an institution could be certified only if the institution meets all
the applicable standards for participation in subpart B of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, because the requirement that each time an institution seeks to begin to participate in a Title IV, HEA program
the specified individuals must complete ``precertification training'' provided by or approved by the Secretary
is a certification requirement, the Secretary proposes to move this requirement from the current &sect;668.12 (Institutional
participation agreement) to this section. The Secretary proposes to amend this requirement to clarify that an institution
subject to this training requirement may not begin participation until the individuals have completed the training.
Under current regulations, the Secretary specifies that an institution may request an on-site review (instead of
electing to use the precertification training procedures) before beginning its participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 498(g) of the HEA, the Secretary proposes to delineate the period for which an institution
may participate in a Title IV, HEA program. Generally, this period is the maximum of four years permitted by the HEA;
however, the Secretary may specify a shorter period as the Secretary deems necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498(h) of the HEA permits the Secretary to provisionally certify an institution to participate in a Title
IV, HEA program in a number of circumstances. Provisional certification permits the Secretary to allow an institution
that otherwise would not qualify to participate in a Title IV, HEA program to participate. However, because such an
institution cannot meet all the requirements for ``full'' certification, the institution's participation would
be limited. For example, an institution that is provisionally certified could be monitored more closely to the extent
that the Secretary believes the institution warrants a greater degree of oversight. Further, in accordance with
the statute, an institution that is provisionally certified is subject to shorter periods of participation than
a fully certified institution. The Secretary notes that these limitations may vary, within the limits of the statute,
to address the specific circumstances of the institution. Finally, under the terms of provisional certification,
an institution will not have the right to a formal appeal under subpart G of this part if the Secretary revokes the institution's
provisional certification; instead, the Secretary proposes to offer the institution a modified appeal. These limitations
are addressed in more detail later in this discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 498(h) of the HEA, the Secretary may provisionally certify an institution that: (1) Applies for initial
participation in any Title IV, HEA program; (2) has its administrative capability or financial responsibility determined
by the Secretary for the first time; (3) undergoes a change of ownership; (4) seeks to renew its certification and jeopardizes
its ability to perform its financial responsibilities by not meeting the factors of financial responsibility or
standards of administrative capability in proposed &sect;&sect;668.15 and 668.16 (and whose participation has
been limited or suspended under subpart G of this part, or voluntarily enters into provisional certification); or
(5) is a participating institution that was accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized accrediting
agency on the day before the Secretary withdrew recognition of that agency. In addition, the Secretary is proposing
to add, to the list of institutions that may be provisionally certified, an institution that allowed its specified
period of participation to expire without reapplying and qualifying for participation in time.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary intends to use provisional certification as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanism for monitoring an institution that has not previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participated or one that has changed ownership, until it has time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish a track record. In keeping with current practice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary does not intend to certify any initial applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until it has successfully completed a period of provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification. Because many of the requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification cannot be met until an institution has participated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Title IV, HEA programs for a period of time, an initially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating institution would still have the opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate while establishing a record that demonstrates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with all of the proposed current standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation. The Secretary notes that certain factors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility and administrative capability, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements governing the appropriate handling of Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program funds and timely submission of required audits and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports, cannot be judged until an institution has Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program funds to administer. In these cases, instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifying that an institution meets all the standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart B, the Secretary certifies that an institution has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated that it meets all the standards it can currently and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will be able to meet all the standards in subpart B to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify it for full certification within a period of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the Secretary. Such an institution will receive a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified program participation agreement. For the same reasons, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary also intends to use provisional certification for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all institutions that undergo a change of ownership. Provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification would permit them to participate in Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs while demonstrating over time that they can meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for participation under the new ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the HEA provides that the Secretary may use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisional certification for institutions that are currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating who will have their financial responsibility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability determined for the first time. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions have been participating in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs since before the establishment of the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility and administrative capability standards, and have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
never undergone a certification review. These institutions may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be allowed the time necessary to establish that they can remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any deficiencies found and meet the standards for participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, under the provisions of the Technical Amendments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, the Secretary may provisionally certify a participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that is undergoing a certification review if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that the institution is in a financial or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative position that could jeopardize the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to perform its financial responsibilities under its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreement. The Secretary may provisionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify an institution under this provision if the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation has been limited or suspended under subpart G of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this part, or voluntarily enters into provisional certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the Secretary proposes to use provisional certification as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a probationary period for some participating institutions, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary determines that the institutions are capable of meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards for full certification by the end of that period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the Secretary might find that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying for recertification on its own fails to meet one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in proposed &sect;668.15. If the Secretary determines that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the failure could jeopardize the institution's ability to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its financial responsibilities, such as the payment of refunds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary would provisionally certify the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Secretary proposes to use provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification for institutions that seek a renewal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in a Title IV, HEA program after the expiration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a prior period of participation in that program. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will examine the reasons for the lapse in participation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if additional safeguards are necessary for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to demonstrate that it is capable of resuming its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not intend to certify an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisionally if the institution does not meet the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility standards, unless the institution provides the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary with certain additional financial guarantees of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to continue operating. The Secretary believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional financial guarantees are necessary in that situation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that funds may be available to repay liabilities or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay required refunds that could arise under the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The Secretary generally does not intend to certify an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution provisionally if the institution does not meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general standards of financial responsibility or the exceptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the general standards of financial responsibility under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;668.15(d) unless the institution meets three additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. First, the institution would have to demonstrate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial and administrative resources to participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs under a funding arrangement other than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Educations's standard advance funding arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the institution could be funded through an escrow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement where an approved third party controls the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's access to Title IV, HEA program funds. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that it is necessary for the Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education to have the added control over Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds provided by an escrow arrangement. Second, the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to submit to the Secretary a letter of credit payable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Secretary equal to not less than 10 percent of the Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete award year for which figures are available; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that 10 percent of an institution's Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program funds is the minimum necessary to ensure repayment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities that may be identified during the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of provisional certification. Further, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by an institution during the last complete award year for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures are available provides the most accurate indication of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds the institution will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in the next award year. Third, the institution would have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that it has met all of its financial obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the preceding two award years, including (but not limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to) the payment of required refunds and repayments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered by the Secretary. The Secretary believes that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that could meet this proposed standard has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established a track record for meeting its financial obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that an institution that is applying for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial participation in the Title IV, HEA programs could not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the proposed requirement that the institution submit to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary a letter of credit payable to the Secretary equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to not less than 10 percent of the Title IV, HEA program funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received by the institution during the last complete award year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which figures are available because the institution would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have received any Title IV, HEA program funds during the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award year. The Secretary requests comments on a comparable way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine the amount of a letter of credit for an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is applying for initial participation in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also would impose additional conditions on any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that has not been considered financially responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under proposed &sect;668.15 at any time within the past five years, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the institution is not considered financially responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one of the following reasons (as delineated in &sect;668.15(c)(2)): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The institution has been limited, suspended, terminated or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entered into a settlement agreement to resolve such an action by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary or a guaranty agency within the preceding five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years; (2) the institution had an audit finding during its two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most recent audits, or a program review finding during its two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most recent program reviews, that resulted in the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being required to repay an amount greater than five percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV, HEA funds that the institution received for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award year covered by the audit or the program review; or (3) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution failed to address satisfactorily any compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems identified in program review or audit reports based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a final decision of the Secretary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An institution in these categories could only be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisionally certified if, in addition to meeting whatever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions the Secretary might reasonably require of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisionally certified institution, the institution satisfied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one of the following conditions. First, the institution, or one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or more persons or entities that the Secretary determines to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise substantial control over the institution, or both, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to submit to the Secretary financial guarantees in an amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to satisfy the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's potential liabilities arising from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, one or more persons or entities that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines to exercise substantial control over the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to agree to be jointly or severally liable for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities arising from the institution's participation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs and any civil and criminal monetary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties authorized under Title IV of the HEA. The law permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to impose these conditions on these institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary is announcing that he would always impose them, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because these circumstances are indicative that extra protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is needed for the institution and their students to be permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to benefit from the use of Title IV, HEA program funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, provisional certification may be granted for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of no longer than three award years. In accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 498(h) of the HEA, an institution that is applying for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial participation may be provisionally certified for a period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of no longer than one award year. A participating institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that was accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency on the day before the Secretary withdrew the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's recognition of that agency may be provisionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified for no longer than 18 months after the date that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary withdrew that recognition. The Secretary has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to specify a shorter period of provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 498(h) of the HEA, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may revoke an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, at any time before the end of a period of provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, if the Secretary determines that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation agreement. If the Secretary makes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination, the Secretary would notify the institution of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination by mail, unless the Secretary chooses more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expeditious means, and revocation would take effect on date that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice is mailed. The institution would have to adhere to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of proposed &sect;668.26 which describes the consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of revocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms of the provisional certification, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution does not have the right to a formal appeal under subpart G of this part before the revocation takes effect.
However, the Secretary proposes to allow the institution to submit a written request to reconsider the revocation
within 20 days of the institution's receipt of the Secretary's notice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the revocation takes effect. The institution's request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconsideration would have to include written evidence that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revocation is unwarranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Secretary decides that the revocation is unwarranted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's provisional certification would be reinstated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with the time, terms, and conditions set out in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's original provisional certification. If, after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of the institution's submission, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denies the institution's request, the institution would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted to reapply for participation in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs before at least 18 months after the revocation or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration of any debarment or suspension of the institution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is later. Generally, an institution whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation has been terminated because the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisional certification was revoked would be able to apply for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reinstatement after 18 months. However, a debarment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension under E.O. 12549 or the FAR can last 3 or more years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change would eliminate any doubt that a debarred or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended institution may apply for reinstatement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation during the period of a debarment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension. The Secretary will not accept any application by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debarred or suspended institution until the debarment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension has expired or been removed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations governing program participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements state only the basic terms of participation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs and the purpose and scope of the agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the Secretary and individual institutions. All of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific provisions of the program participation agreement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are listed in section 487(a) of the HEA are not restated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Instead, all the specific statutory provisions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the actual agreement signed between the Secretary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual institutions. The Secretary proposes to revise this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of the regulations to include not only the new provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of program participation agreements added by the Amendments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, but also those provisions previously prescribed by the HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not specifically spelled out in this section. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will specify which proposed changes have been made to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section as a result of the Amendments of 1992 to distinguish them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the provisions that the Secretary proposes to add that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already existed under the HEA, but have not been codified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional provisions of program participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements enumerated in the HEA, as well as other changes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary is proposing in order to clarify what the agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover and to reflect new procedures and statutory language, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By providing a comprehensive list of the provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basic program participation agreement in one section, thus making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to all the provisions more convenient, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hopes to facilitate institutions' understanding of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities with respect to initial and continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to clarify the scope of the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation agreement. By signing a program participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement, an institution indicates it understands that its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial or continued participation in the Title IV, HEA programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is contingent on compliance with the Student Assistance General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions regulations, the regulations of the specific Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs in which the institution participates, and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional requirements specific to that institution that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requires the institution to meet. Further, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes to make clear the long-standing practice that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program participation agreement applies to each branch or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other additional location of the institution that meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable requirements of the Student Assistance General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions, unless the Secretary specifies otherwise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to specify that by entering into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreement the institution agrees to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not only with statutory and regulatory requirements, but also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any special arrangement, agreement, or limitation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed expansion of this provision is necessary to make it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear that if it is to participate in a Title IV, HEA program, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must adhere not only to those requirements listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute and regulations, but to any conditions of provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, any limitation imposed on the institution to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution has agreed, or any other special arrangement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution makes pursuant to statutory or regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority under Title IV of the HEA. The Secretary also believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is necessary to clarify the Secretary's longstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation that to begin or continue to participate in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program, an institution must comply with each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement applicable to that program, not just selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add a clause specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring that institutions that receive Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds under an advance payment method must time their requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for funds to meet immediate programs needs. The Secretary finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this addition is necessary because, in the absence of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically stated requirement, too many institutions have drawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
down funds in excess of immediate need, thereby adding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessarily to the Federal debt by causing the Treasury to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incur interest costs on funds given to institutions that were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to meet immediate needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments of 1992, as clarified by the Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1993, has removed the requirement that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may not request from or charge any student a fee for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing or handling the Federal Student Assistance Report, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform with other statutory provisions of the Amendments of 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that eliminated previous references to that report. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would remove the corresponding regulatory language from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. No change has been made to the general requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution may not request from or charge any student a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee for processing or handling any application, form, or data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to determine a student's eligibility for, and amount of, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the HEA, an institution must establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maintain necessary administrative and fiscal procedures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records to ensure proper and efficient administration of Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program funds that the institution receives from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary or from students. Further, the Amendments of 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that the institution provide, upon request and in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely manner, information relating to its administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability and financial responsibility of the institution to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary, the appropriate State postsecondary review entity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated under Part H of Title IV of the HEA, any applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency under the FFEL programs, and the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency or agencies. The Secretary proposes to add to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this list of agencies the institution's State agency with legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction over the institution and, where appropriate, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency recognized by the Secretary for the approval of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public postsecondary education as an alternative to accreditation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or preaccreditation. The Secretary believes that it is important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these agencies also have access to information regarding an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial responsibility and administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HEA requires that an institution must agree to comply with the Secretary's regulations governing financial responsibility
and administrative capability. Thus, the Secretary would specify that the institution must agree to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with proposed-to-be-redesignated &sect;&sect;668.15 and 668.16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEA requires that an institution must submit reports, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed by the Secretary, to the Secretary, or, as appropriate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holders of student loans under the Title IV, HEA programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing information required to administer the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The Secretary considers this provision to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEA requires that an institution may not provide any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement to a student or certification to a lender under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL programs that qualifies a student for loans in excess of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual and aggregate limits for which the student is eligible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with statutory requirements. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to extend this requirement to include unsubsidized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Stafford loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEA requires that an institution must comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer information requirements in subpart D of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The Secretary considers this provision to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEA requires that an institution that advertises job 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement rates as a means of procuring enrollment must make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to prospective students data necessary to substantiate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the truthfulness of the advertisement. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1992 require that an institution make available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective students the relevant State licensing requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any job for which an institution's educational program is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to prepare prospective students. The HEA also requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution must inform all eligible borrowers under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL programs of their eligibility for and the availability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State grant assistance. The Secretary considers this provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to streamline these regulations, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to list in one place in this section all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifications that an institution must make to participate in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program. The institution would have to agree in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its program participation agreement to provide these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifications. These certifications include the following: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That the institution has in operation a drug abuse prevention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program accessible to any of the institution's officers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees, and students; and (2) establishment of a campus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security policy and disclosure requirements as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 485(f) of the HEA. The Secretary considers this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEA requires that an institution make available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who receive Title IV, HEA program aid based on their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to benefit from the training offered a program proven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful in assisting those students to obtain the recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent of a high school diploma. The Secretary considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments of 1992 require an institution to agree that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it will not deny any form of Federal financial aid to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible student solely on the grounds that the student is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating in a program of study abroad approved for credit by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution. The Secretary considers this provision to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments of 1992 require that as a condition for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation any institution seeking to participate for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first time in the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal SLS programs and any institution participating in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan programs that changes ownership resulting in a change of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control or changes its status as a main campus, branch campus, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an additional location, develop and implement for two years a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default management plan. The Secretary proposes to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to develop and implement, or submit if required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary, a default management plan developed in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the default reduction measures described in appendix D of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulations to meet this requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution must acknowledge the authority of the Secretary, guaranty agencies
and lenders as defined in 34 CFR part 682, nationally recognized accrediting agencies, the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs, and State postsecondary review entities designated under subpart 1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA, to share
with each other any information pertaining to the institution's eligibility for or participation in the Title IV,
HEA programs, or any information on fraud and abuse. The Secretary proposes to add to this list of agencies the institution's
State agency with legal jurisdiction over the institution and, where appropriate, the State agency recognized by
the Secretary for the approval of public postsecondary education as an alternative to accreditation or preaccreditation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory provision that governs the effect of fraud and criminal conduct by individuals, agencies, or organizations
affiliated with an institution was discussed in the NPRM published on February 17, 1994 (in part II) that deals with
third-party servicers. The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution must timely and satisfactorily complete
any survey conducted as a part of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), or other Federal data
collection effort on postsecondary institutions. The Secretary considers this provision to be self-explanatory
and proposes to add this statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive modifications. The Amendments
of 1992 spell out the requirements imposed on participating institutions that offer athletically related student
aid. In order to participate in a Title IV, HEA program, an institution that offers athletically related student aid
must compile annually and have audited independently at least every 3 years, data on the revenues derived by the institution
from and expenses made by the institution for the institution's intercollegiate athletics activities. This compilation
must include data on total revenues and total expenses, revenues and expenses attributable to football, revenues
and expenses attributable to men's basketball, revenues and expenses attributable to women's basketball, revenues
and expenses attributable to all other men's sports combined, and revenues and expenses attributable to all other
women's sports combined. The compilation must also include data on the total revenues and operating expenses of the
institution. The institution is required to prepare the compilation within 6 months after the end of the institution's
fiscal year. The institution must make the compilation and, where allowable by State law, the required audits, available
for inspection by the Secretary and the public. For purposes of this compilation, the Amendments of 1992 define revenues
from intercollegiate athletics activities allocable to a sport to include without limitation gate receipts, broadcast
revenues, appearance guarantees and options, concessions, and advertising. Revenues such as student activities
fees or alumni contributions not allocable to a sport must be included in the calculation of total revenues only. The
Amendments of 1992 define expenses for intercollegiate athletics activities allocable to a sport to include without
limitation grants-in-aid, salaries, travel, equipment, and supplies. Expenses such as general and administrative
overhead that are not allocable to a sport must be included in the calculation of total expenses only. Generally, the
Secretary is proposing to restate the language of the statute in the regulations. However, the Secretary proposes
changes to conform with the NCAA's 1989 Financial Audit Guidelines. In addition to the statutory definition of what
is included in revenues from intercollegiate athletics activities allocable to a sport, the Secretary proposes
to specify that other conference distributions in addition to broadcast revenues would also be included. The Secretary
also proposes to specify that revenues such as investment interest income that are not allocable to a sport would be
included in the calculation of total revenues only.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments of 1992 provide that an institution may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose any penalty on any student because of the student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution as a result of the delayed disbursement of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title IV, HEA program loan due to compliance with statutory and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory requirements for the Title IV, HEA programs, or delays 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to the institution. The statute specifies that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those prohibited penalties include the assessment of late fees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional facilities, or the requirement that the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrow additional funds. The Secretary proposes to clarify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the restriction that institutions may not require a student to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrow additional funds would apply only to funds for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest or other charges are assessed. Therefore, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision would not apply to any interest-free loans that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution might require the student to borrow until other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources of aid are available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments of 1992 provide that an institution may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recruiting or admission activities. An institution also may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide such an incentive payment to any persons or entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in making decisions regarding the awarding of student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial assistance. The statute specifies that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement does not apply to the recruitment of foreign students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residing in foreign countries who are not eligible to receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal student assistance. The Secretary proposes to extend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this provision to require that institutions also may not contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with entities that improperly provide, any commission, bonus, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other incentive payment as delineated in the statute. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that this provision is necessary to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more rigid restrictions than were seen in the past on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices of ``commissioned salespersons.'' The Secretary proposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to repeat the language of the statute with the addition of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change. The Secretary believes it is clear that this statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement places rigid restrictions on the practice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recruitment, admission activities, and the awarding of student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is aware that some institutions pay incentives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to recruiters or admissions office employees based on the success 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of those persons in enrolling students, provided that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled students maintain satisfactory progress for and remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled in the institution for a specified period of time. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary considers this practice, which commonly is referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an incentive based on ``retention,'' to be an example of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity that is prohibited by the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiator requested further examples of prohibited activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A non-Federal negotiator offered the following examples that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes are not permitted by the statute. (1) An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution might offer payments or gifts to students for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referring other prospective students for admission to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. (2) An institution might offer payments or gifts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students on the condition that persons whom the students referred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the institution were actually admitted and remained enrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the institution for a specified period of time. (3) An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution might present gifts to alumni, such as coffee mugs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sporting events tickets, or contributions in their name for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referring students to the institution for admission. (4) An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution might pay bonuses to Directors of Admissions (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other management personnel) based on the number of enrollments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received during a particular academic year or the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who, after enrolling, remained at the institution until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all financial aid had been received. The Secretary specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on these examples and others that might serve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as useful guidelines in these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with applicable requirements established by all members of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``triad''; i.e., the Secretary, State postsecondary review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities, and nationally recognized accrediting agencies pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to part H of title IV of the HEA. The Secretary considers this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the institutional refund policy established in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;668.22. The Secretary considers this provision to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in addition to the statutory requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreements, an institution would have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agree to be liable for all improperly spent or unspent funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received under the title IV, HEA programs, including funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered by a third-party servicer, and refunds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution or its servicer may be required to make. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision was proposed and discussed in the NPRM published on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 17, 1994 (in part II) that deals with third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments of 1992 and the Technical Amendments of 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended the HEA to require that an institution that has a change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in ownership resulting in a change in control reestablish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional eligibility and undergo a certification review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before it may participate in any title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary is proposing to remove the provision in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulations that permitted the new participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement of an institution that changed ownership to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective on the date of the change of ownership. Instead, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations, the program participation agreement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution that changes ownership would be effective on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date that the Secretary signs the agreement, just as any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new program participation agreement would. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to specify that a program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation agreement expires if the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation ends because: (1) The institution closes or stops 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing educational programs for a reason other than a normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacation period or a natural disaster that directly affects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution or the institution's students; (2) the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loses its institutional eligibility under 34 CFR part 600; (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's period of participation, as specified under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.13, expires (that is, the four-year limit on participation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the limits on participation established pursuant to provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, or shorter periods established by the Secretary), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the institution's provisional certification is revoked under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.13; (4) the Secretary determines under &sect;668.13(c) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that is applying for certification has jeopardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its ability to perform its financial responsibilities by not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the factors of financial responsibility under &sect;668.15 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards of administrative capability under &sect;668.16 (in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case of an institution whose participation has been limited or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended under subpart G of this part, or voluntarily enters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into provisional certification); or (5) the Secretary receives a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice from the appropriate SPRE that the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation should be withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions would conform to the provisions in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.26 governing the end of an institution's participation in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title IV, HEA program. The first of these circumstances listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above is purely a clarification of existing practice. The last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three describe circumstances mandated by the change made to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA by the Amendments of 1992.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to redesignate &sect;668.13 as &sect;668.15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section includes provisions dealing with third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers that were proposed in the NPRM published on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 17, 1994 (in part II). The Secretary will not repeat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the discussion of those provisions here. However, this third-party servicer NPRM proposed to apply the general standards
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility that are proposed in this NPRM to third-party servicers that contract with lenders or guaranty
agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to administer any aspect of the title IV, HEA programs.

Section 487 of the HEA requires the Secretary to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to determine the financial responsibility of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution as a part of the Secretary's determination that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is able to participate in a title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498 of the HEA mandates some of the standards that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary must use in making a determination of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. In general, section 498 of the HEA adopted, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications, the standards used by the Secretary in current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.13 of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require an institution to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is financially responsible under the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in this section.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
General Standards of Financial Responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;668.15, the Secretary would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list general standards of financial responsibility. The first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six standards are applicable to all institutions. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
498(c)(1) of the HEA specifies that an institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility must be determined based on whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is able to provide the services that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims to provide, to provide administrative resources necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comply with Title IV, HEA program requirements, and to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of the institution's financial obligations, including refunds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary. These standards were adopted from current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and the Secretary proposes to continue to use them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add to the list of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility requirements for all institutions the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that an institution be current on any debt service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments. An institution normally has variable costs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluctuate to meet the demand created by increasing or decreasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume in those costs such as those for educational supplies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses and instructor salaries associated with educating an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing or decreasing number of students. Debt service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents a fixed cost, such as mortgage or lease payments, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution that generally does not fluctuate with that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume. Thus, in a situation in which an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiencing a decline in revenue due to a decrease in new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollments, debt service would remain unchanged. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's flexibility to deal financially with the decline is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced because management typically is unable to adjust the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of payment for debt service without the consent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creditor to whom the debt is owed. This situation places some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of control outside the institution and beyond the scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management's ability to deal with a deteriorating situation by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing costs. Furthermore, a failure to meet debt service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments might precipitate collective action on the part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creditors to place the institution in an involuntary liquidation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation under Federal bankruptcy laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, a growing institution usually must take on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more debt to fund its operations. Should the growth fail to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue, the institution might be unable to service the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing debt service associated with its expansion. Thus, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes an institution's failure to remain current on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its debt service payments would be a strong indicator of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's inability to meet its financial obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA provides that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must establish requirements for an institution to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient cash reserves to ensure repayment of any required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunds. Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA also provides for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption to this requirement which is discussed below under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require an institution to maintain, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all times, a minimum cash reserve of at least 10 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's total deferred tuition income at the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's most recent fiscal year for repayment of refunds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cash reserve would have to be maintained in a cash reserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account and would have to consist of cash or cash equivalents, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those terms are defined in accordance with generally acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that it would be unreasonable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unduly burdensome to require an institution to calculate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of its cash reserve on a continual basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Secretary would require an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine its total deferred income at the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's fiscal year and calculate the percentage based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that total. Once that percentage is determined, the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to maintain that amount of cash reserve at all times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until a new calculation is performed at the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's subsequent fiscal year. The calculation would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the institution's total deferred tuition income because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deferred tuition income is an indicator of the value of services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the institution will provide for the coming year. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requests comment on a comparable way to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate level for the cash reserve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ten percent of this amount represents roughly the equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a month's worth of an institution's revenue. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers this amount a reasonable amount for an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have available to pay refunds in the event of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precipitous closure. Generally, under this proposal, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would demonstrate its compliance with this provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
once a year with the submission of the institution's audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements. However, because an institution would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to maintain this cash reserve at all times, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would reserve the right to evaluate an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the requirement at any time. Finally, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal to allow cash equivalents to be included in the cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserve is consistent with generally accepted accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Secretary proposes that, in order to be financially responsible, an institution must not have as part
of its audit report for its most recently completed fiscal year any of the following. First, the institution's audit
would not contain a statement by the accountant acknowledging substantial doubt about the institution's ability
to continue operating as a going concern. A ``going concern'' statement is a professional opinion rendered by an independent
certified public accountant, commenting on the institution's unstable financial condition and informing the reader
of the possibility that the institution may not survive the coming fiscal year. Although such a ``going concern''
statement is rarely issued, its presence attests to a concern held by the auditor that the institution's ability to
continue operating is uncertain. The Secretary believes that if an auditor, after close examination of the institution's
operations, concludes that such a statement is warranted, this is cause for the Department to protect its interest
in the Title IV, HEA program funds administered by the institution by requiring the institution to be subject to the
appropriate remedies for establishing financial responsibility, or to be subject to provisional certification
or the proceedings in subpart G of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the institution's audit could not contain a finding of unauthorized use of donor restricted net assets to
meet current operating expenses. Unauthorized use of donor restricted net assets is a violation of the restrictions
placed on donations by the donor. Any donor-restricted funds are placed in an endowment fund to be used for specific
purposes, such as providing scholarships. Donor restricted net assets are most commonly found at nonprofit institutions.
The Secretary believes that if this money is transferred to current funds or total net assets for current operating
expenses, this is not only an indication of extremely impaired cash flow, but also a violation of an institution's
responsibility as a fiduciary of Title IV, HEA program funds.

Third, the institution's audit could not contain a disclaimed or adverse opinion by the accountant. A disclaimed
or adverse opinion is an indicator that the auditor is unable to perform a complete audit of the institution with the
assurance that the audit presents a reliable presentation of the institution's financial condition. An audit submitted
with such a disclaimer or limitation would cause the institution's financial report to be rejected by the Secretary.
Such a statement in the auditor's report is an indication that the financial statement was not prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles as required in current regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute authorizes the Secretary to prescribe criteria for evaluating operating losses, net worth, asset to
liabilities ratios and operating fund deficits. The Secretary's goal in developing these proposed regulations
is to ensure that institutions are capable to operate as a fiduciary of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds based on a sufficient financial base to properly provide education and meet the institution's financial obligations.
The Secretary, therefore, proposes to amend the current factors of financial responsibility section to establish
new financial responsibility standards as a means of further refining the above requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that, as in the past, failure to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any one of the factors may result in initiation of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative proceeding to limit, suspend, fine or terminate an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. Because some of these proposed factors are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent than those currently found in the regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary recognizes that an institution may need a sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time to adjust its operations in order to come into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with these proposed factors, if they are adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, the Secretary may provisionally certify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that did not meet these proposed standards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide them with this additional period of time to comply, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that the institution shows that it would have met the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Amendments of 1993 require the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take into account an institution's total financial circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in making a determination of an institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. The Secretary believes that these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors evaluate, both directly and indirectly, the overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soundness of an institution's financial condition for the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by its audited financial statements and, therefore, take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account an institution's total financial condition as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the Technical Amendments of 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Amendments of 1993 require that criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed for the determination of an institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility take into account any differences in generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted accounting principles, including required financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements, that are applicable to for-profit and nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. Therefore, in addition to general standards that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all institutions would be required to meet, the Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards applicable specifically to for-profit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit, and public institutions that the Secretary believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate an equal level of financial responsibility. At the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion of some of the negotiators, the proposed specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards of financial responsibility have been organized by type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of institution; i.e., for-profit, nonprofit, and public.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to differences in legal and reporting entity, mission, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and accounting format for nonprofit entities and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
profit-seeking entities, there are differing tests of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility to be applied. Evaluating a nonprofit entity's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall financial condition is more complicated because there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no commonly accepted standard of acceptable financial condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, a measure of an institution's financial condition is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure of an institution's solvency, or the ability of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to adequately cover its expenditures with revenues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining an institution's financial condition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes it is necessary to look at the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-term solvency and long-term solvency, which is the ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an institution to support an adequate level of services over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the long run, withstanding economic disruption and meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changing demands for services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With accounting for for-profit entities, analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements provides an understanding of an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial condition through comparisons of key financial ratios 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that measure the institution's ability to remain solvent while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing to provide educational services at acceptable levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examination of financial information from nonprofit entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires a review of other organizational factors that measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability of the institution to provide educational services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using a larger and more complex source of funds. It is therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to differentiate the standards that are applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
profit-seeking entities from the standards that are applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary will first address the specific standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for-profit institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require that a for-profit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution have, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1.25:1. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commonly used means of determining whether or not the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has sufficient short-term solvency is use of the ratio of current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets to current liabilities. For the past fourteen years the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department has used a current assets to current liabilities ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of at least 1:1 as an indicator of financial responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This means that the institution has current assets at least equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to their current liabilities. In theory, this would indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution has sufficient resources to handle not only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt service, but also other liabilities for at least the coming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal year. The higher the amount of assets, the better the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquidity position of the institution and, therefore, the better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution will be able to handle unforeseen economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. The Secretary believes that the current 1:1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benchmark offers little or no indication of adequate short-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvency. A 1.25:1 benchmark has, therefore, been proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for-profit institutions. Cash is now required to be a component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the proposed increase in current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets will help to ensure that institutions have sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources to provide worthwhile education and training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is proposing a higher ratio of current assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to current liabilities ratio for for-profit institutions than for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit institutions. The Secretary believes that a higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current ratio is necessary for for-profit institutions because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they will be less likely, in the event of hampered liquidity, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draw on fund-raising as a source of cash. This rationale is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed later as part of the discussion of the proposed ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of current assets to current liabilities for nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to exclude from the calculation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this ratio for for-profit institutions, uncollateralized loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receivable from owners and related parties. Uncollateralized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related party loans are loans that have been made to affiliates, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officers, or employees and have not been secured by tangible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets. In accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin 43 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ARB43), chapter 3A, paragraph 6, the concept of current assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemplates the exclusion from that classification of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources as ``*&blank;*&blank;* (c) receivables arising from unusual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions (such as the sale of capital assets, or loans or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advances to affiliates, officers, or employees) that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to be received within twelve (12) months''. In the event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that certain financial statements present these types of loans on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the balance sheet, they will be disregarded by the Secretary in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computation of the current ratio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, because the proposed cash reserve requirement may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause a portion of the institution's cash reserves to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified as a restricted asset, which would, under generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted accounting principles, be excluded from classification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as current assets, the Secretary's proposal specifies that, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for-profit institutions, the cash reserves may be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's current assets in calculating the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current assets to current liabilities ratio. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that it is appropriate to permit for-profit institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to treat the cash reserves as current assets because the funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are held for the benefit of the students, and inclusion of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts toward demonstrating a 1.25:1 current ratio still leaves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution with sufficient unrestricted assets to pay all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current expenses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes that a for-profit institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible if it has not had operating losses over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both of its two latest fiscal years that cause an operating loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding 10 percent of the institution's previous year's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tangible net worth for its latest fiscal year. While it may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be unusual for an institution to record a loss in any fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year, this loss is not harmful so long as the loss is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessive, is not indicative of a deteriorating trend in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial condition, and the institution otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets the factors substantiating its financial strength. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes to define an operating loss, for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these provisions, as total net income minus extraordinary gains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or losses, income or losses from discontinued operations, prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period adjustments, and the cumulative effect of changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principle, estimate, or reporting entity. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes that the calculation of tangible net worth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall exclude all assets defined as intangible in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally accepted accounting principles. The Secretary believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this standard will measure whether a profit-seeking entity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating from current cash flow to the extent possible. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate residual effect of these activities on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organization's individual net assets is represented, along with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any interfund transfers that may have taken place during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that a for-profit institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible if it had, for its latest fiscal year, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive tangible net worth. The Secretary proposes that, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of this section, a positive tangible net worth occurs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the institution's tangible assets exceed its liabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Secretary proposes that the calculation of tangible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net worth shall exclude all assets defined as intangible in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying this proposed standard, the Secretary could consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of extraordinary gains or losses resulting from unusual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and infrequent events, and could take into consideration the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, estimate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting entity to the extent that such a change results in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more accurate representation of the institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles. For the past fourteen years, the Department has had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a standard for net worth that states that an institution is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible if it has a deficit net worth (i.e., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's liabilities exceed its assets.), a measure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term solvency. Therefore, an institution with a net worth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of zero meets this current requirement. The proposed change from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalizing a deficit net worth to requiring a positive net worth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is only a technical change in form that should affect few, if any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By excluding all assets classified as intangible, all assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as goodwill, organization costs, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covenants-not-to-compete, which have little market value in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of an institution's overall solvency will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminated in the calculation of net worth. In purchasing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, the new owner pays an amount and allocates the market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value to individual tangible assets in order to prepare financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements. After applying the proper market value to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various assets, any residual amount that appears on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's balance sheet as goodwill, organization costs, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covenant-not-to-compete, is classified as an intangible asset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Secretary's intent to identify those institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that do not have sufficient capital assets. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses that operate on month-to-month leases with minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital actually invested in the business are a potential risk to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students, and ultimately to the taxpayers in terms of possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collapse and bailout. In these cases loans to students are often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically discharged in accordance with provisions in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA. Preventing institutions that have no real assets from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating in the programs should enhance the gatekeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of nonprofit institutions, the Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed standards in accordance with Statement of Financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accounting Standards No. 117 (FAS 117) that was issued in June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). FAS 117 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
altered the reporting format for not-for-profit organizations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the negotiated rulemaking process was already well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underway. FAS 117 is effective for annual financial statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for organizations with less than $5 million in total assets and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than $1 million in annual expenses. For those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations, the Statement is effective for fiscal years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning after December 15, 1995 with earlier application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require a nonprofit institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare a classified statement of financial position in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the Secretary with the financial information necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the institution's financial responsibility under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations. The Secretary proposes that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatively, a nonprofit institution could provide this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information as footnotes to the audit. Although FAS 117 does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a nonprofit institution to submit a classified statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of financial position prior to published implementation dates, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not prohibit the institution from doing so. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notes that a financial statement that is not classified is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structured to provide the financial information necessary for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to determine an institution's compliance with these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations; however, the information could be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as footnotes to the audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that a nonprofit institution is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible if it cannot demonstrate, at the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its latest fiscal year, a ratio of current assets to current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities of at least 1:1. The Secretary proposes to not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit a nonprofit institution to include the cash reserves in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's current assets. The Secretary believes that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the proposed current assets to current liabilities ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a nonprofit institution is 1:1, if the institution used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated reserve funds to meet this ratio, there would be no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance of solvency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The importance of a higher current ratio for for-profit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions lies in the fact that they are not as likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to draw on fund raising as a source of cash in the event of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hampered liquidity because donors are less likely to contribute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds to a for-profit institution where those contributions would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be tax deductible. Many nonprofit institutions have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient support in the community and from friends and alumni 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who are willing to donate to the institution. The cash intake of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for-profit institutions is therefore limited to cash generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through profitability, whereas nonprofit institutions have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional source of cash. Endowments, even when restricted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions such as providing scholarships, are awarded and may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken into cash from operations. Consistent profitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations result in a better liquidity position for for-profit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, whereas consistent profitable operations are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for a nonprofit to remain viable. In addition, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherent in a nonprofit institution that its final cash position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not reflect a profit. In the nonprofit industry, the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager has limited authority. The financial manager may make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations, but the ultimate authority lies with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing board. There is, therefore, less control in the hands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of financial managers and a corresponding decrease in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to control a liquidity situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lack of liquidity means that the institution is unable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service its current debt. This can lead to the forced sale of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term investments and assets. To the owners of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, a lack of liquidity will mean reduced profitability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or it may mean loss of control or loss of the entire capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment. To creditors of the enterprise, it means slow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection of principal and interest due or even loss of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts due them. Students of these institutions can also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by a short-term poor financial condition. These effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may take the form of inability of the institution to perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their contract, inability to make refunds due to students or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders, or the loss of supplier relationships. Suppliers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested in an institution's liquidity position, and if it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found to be inadequate, it may cease to do business with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution.

financially responsible if it has had a decrease in total net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets at the end of its latest fiscal year of such significance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, if continued, would result in a ratio current assets to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current liabilities of less than 1:1. Under this proposal, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary could consider the effect of extraordinary gains or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses resulting from unusual and infrequent events, and could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take into consideration the cumulative effect of a change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principle, estimate or reporting entity to the extent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such a change results in a more accurate representation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's financial position in accordance with generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted accounting principles. For purposes of this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis, the Secretary could exclude unrealized gains and losses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on investments that have been reported as changes in unrestricted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net assets. The standard was revised to reflect the changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brought about with the issuance of FASB 117 and in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide parity with the for-profit institutions. The concept of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net worth, as it applies to profit-seeking entities, does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist for a not-for-profit entity. Upon implementation of FASB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
117, fund accounting will no longer be used for colleges and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universities, but these entities will adopt a format that is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to the format for-profit entities have been using. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term ``fund balance'' will no longer apply, but will be replaced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total net assets, divided into unrestricted, temporarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restricted and permanently restricted assets. For institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not required to implement FAS 117 prior to the effective date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations, the regulations applying to nonprofits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently found in 34 CFR 668.13(c), ``the institution shall not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a deficit current unrestricted fund balance'', will remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect until the institution adopts FAS 117. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary requests comments on whether the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should determine a nonprofit institution to be financially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible even if it does not meet these requirements if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has an acceptable ``bond rating''. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggests that a type of acceptable bond rating may be a current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general obligation or general obligation equivalent debt rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(because such a rating is backed by the full resources of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution) by a nationally recognized debt rating organization, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by the Secretary, that is at least investment grade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that a public institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible only if the institution has its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities backed by the full faith and credit of the State, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by an equivalent government. The Secretary is aware that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principles for public institutions differ from those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for for-profit and nonprofit institutions. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicits comments on other acceptable measures of a public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial responsibility that take the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principles into account.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to remove from the factors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility the provisions in current &sect;668.13 (c)(4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (d)(2) governing the effect on an institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility of criminal conduct and fraud involving Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds. Those provisions have been superseded by a similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory provision that is addressed in the discussion on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;668.14 governing program participation agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;668.15(c)(2), an institution would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered financially responsible, despite meeting all other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this proposed section, if: (1) The institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been limited, suspended, terminated, or entered into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settlement agreement, to resolve such an action by the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or a guaranty agency within the preceding five years; (2) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution had an audit finding during its two most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits, or a program review finding during its two most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program reviews, that resulted in the institution's being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to repay an amount greater than five percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA funds that the institution received for any award 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year covered by the audit or the program review; or (3) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution failed to address satisfactorily any compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems identified in program review or audit reports based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a final decision of the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consequences of this proposed provision are described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more fully earlier in this preamble in the discussion on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisional certification. Essentially, institutions that fall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into one of these categories not only would not be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible, but could not be provisionally certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the submission of certain financial guarantees or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal assumptions of liability arising from participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV, HEA programs.

Exceptions to the General Standards of Financial Responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments of 1992, as amended by the Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1993, provide that the Secretary shall determine an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to be financially responsible even though it does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet certain general standards of financial responsibility, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498(c)(5)(B) of the HEA provides that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall establish a process whereby an institution is exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cash reserve requirement if the institution is located in, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is legally authorized to operate within, a State that has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition recovery fund that ensures that the institution is able 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pay all required refunds and the institution contributes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that tuition recovery fund. The Secretary proposes that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is exempt from the proposed cash reserve requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if it meets these conditions; however, the Secretary proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stipulate that a State's tuition recovery fund must be acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Secretary. The Secretary would like to ensure that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's tuition recovery fund truly has the resources to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment of all required refunds if necessary. To this end, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would expect States to provide as much information as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible to demonstrate that their tuition recovery fund can pay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all required refunds on behalf of an institution that closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precipitously. The Secretary invites comment on what specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards should be used to measure the acceptability of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's tuition recovery fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498(c)(3) of the HEA provides that an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible even though it does not meet the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general standards of financial responsibility, under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following circumstances. First, an institution that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible under the general standards of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility (except the cash reserve requirement) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible if the institution submits to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary third-party financial guarantees, such as performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bonds or letters of credit payable to the Secretary, that equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not less than one-half of the annual potential Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program liabilities of the institution. The Secretary proposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a letter of credit that is payable to the Secretary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective for a period of time as determined by the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be the only acceptable type of third-party guarantee for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement. The determination by the Secretary that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment from a third-party guarantee requires that funds become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately available to make refunds or to reimburse the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary for debts incurred in the programs. It has been the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's experience that letters of credit are the only method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by which funds do become immediately available; however, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requests comments on other standard forms of publicly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranteed security that would provide the same level of security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Secretary. The Secretary notes that an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liable for all mishandled Title IV, HEA program funds that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives. Further, the Secretary believes that the total Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program funds received by an institution during the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete award year is the best indicator of the amount of Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program assistance that the institution will receive for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next award year. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an institution to submit a letter of credit equal to not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than one-half of the Title IV, HEA program funds received by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution during the last complete award year for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures are available in order to meet this requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the Technical Amendments of 1993 provide that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that is not financially responsible under the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards of financial responsibility (except the cash reserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement) is financially responsible if it establishes to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfaction of the Secretary, with the support of a financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement audited by an independent certified accountant with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally accepted accounting standards, that the institution has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient resources to ensure against the precipitous closure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution, including the ability to meet all of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial obligations, including refunds of institutional charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred in programs administered by the Secretary. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes to restate the statute, modifying it only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose to require that the financial statement be submitted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the proposed requirements for documentation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility that will be discussed later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Amendments of 1993 further provide that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is not required to meet the general standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility (except for the cash reserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement) if the institution is an institution that provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2-year or 4-year educational program for which the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
awards an associate or baccalaureate degree that demonstrates to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is not reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doubt as to its continued solvency and ability to deliver quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational services, it is current in its payment of all current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities, including student refunds, repayments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary, payroll, and payment of trade creditors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withholding taxes, and it has substantial equity in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school-occupied facilities, the acquisition of which was the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct cause of its failure to meet the current operating ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. The Secretary proposes to restate the statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without modification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 498(c)(4) of the HEA provides that the determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an institution's financial responsibility be based on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audited and certified financial statement of the institution or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where appropriate, its parent corporation, conducted by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified independent organization or person in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards established by the American Institute of Certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Accountants. The statement must be submitted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary when the institution is applying to begin or continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The statute further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that the Secretary may require the submission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional audits if the first submission does not establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the general standards of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. Although audited financial statements should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rendered in a uniform manner, there is some leeway with regards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to contents of the statements. The Secretary proposes to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to submit financial statements on an annual basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within four months after the end of the institution's fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. The Secretary believes that four months from the end of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's fiscal year is a sufficient period of time for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to submit a financial statement. The Secretary also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifies that, upon request, the institution must provide or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise make available the accountant's work papers in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that all information relevant to preparing an audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statement is readily available. Institutions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already required to provide access to such information pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to current &sect;668.23, and the Secretary proposes to reference that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to records in this proposed section. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes that an institution may be granted a filing extension to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution upon a showing of good cause. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intends that this extension would be granted on an infrequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, as the Secretary believes it is imperative to have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial information from the institution that most accurately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects the current financial situation of the institution.

Section 668.16&blank;Standards of Administrative Capability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to redesignate &sect;668.14 as &sect;668.16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In matters not governed by specific provisions, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
487(c)(1)(B) of the HEA provides for the establishment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards of administrative capability for participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that include any matter the Secretary deems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for the sound administration of the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. Section 498(d) of the HEA, which was added by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1992, authorizes the Secretary to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures and requirements relating to administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability, including the consideration of past performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions or individuals in control of those institutions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance of records. In addition, section 498(d) authorizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to establish other reasonable procedures that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to ensuring that institutions will be administratively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given this framework, the Secretary proposes to strengthen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and modify the administrative capability standards in the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations by making significant, substantive changes to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative standards as well as some technical changes; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant proposed changes to the current regulations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to clarify the Secretary's current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principle that an institution must demonstrate that it is capable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of meeting each of the administrative standards in this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be considered administratively capable. During negotiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking, alternatives to requiring that institutions meet each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative standard were discussed. Among the options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered were that the various factors be ``weighted,'' i.e., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would identify which factors he considered to be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most critical and would incur the greatest penalty if they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not met. Some of the negotiators suggested that the various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors be used only as indicators of capability; that is, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would be required to review each institution that did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not comply with one or more standard to determine the seriousness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of noncompliance. However, the negotiators did not reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consensus on an approach. Therefore, the Secretary is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that to be fully certified as meeting the standards in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section (as well as the other standards in Subpart B of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations) an institution must demonstrate that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administratively capable by meeting all the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. An institution that fails to demonstrate compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with one or two administrative standards could be certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisionally (see the earlier discussion on provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification) if the Secretary were to determine the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of meeting all the standards within a specific time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period and that the noncompliance did not necessitate taking a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stronger sanction such as a fine, limitation, suspension, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination proceeding against the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, an initial applicant would not be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate compliance with all standards prior to participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Secretary expects such an institution to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is capable of complying with all the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary currently provisionally certifies an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial applicant if the Secretary determines that the applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is capable of meeting the current standards within a specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time. The Secretary will continue this practice, using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any additional standards proposed in this section if they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted in final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to make explicit the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, to be considered administratively capable, an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must administer all the Title IV, HEA programs in which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participates in accordance with all applicable statutory and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory provisions and special arrangements, agreements, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations. This expectation has been implicit. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes it is important to lay out this standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together with all the other administrative standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Secretary proposes to clarify what is meant by a capable individual who is responsible for administering the Title
IV, HEA programs. It is important for each institution that is currently participating or seeking to participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs to demonstrate that it has staff who are capable of administering the programs properly.
While obviously a number of factors should be considered in determining what constitutes ``capable,'' the Secretary
believes that one factor that should be addressed in regulations is whether a financial aid administrator has been
certified by his or her State to have that capability. This factor would apply in a State that requires financial aid
administrators to be certified. The Secretary also proposes to consider whether an individual has successfully
completed Title IV, HEA program training that the Secretary has provided or approved. The Secretary is aware that
some professional organizations provide high caliber training in various aspects of the administration of the Title
IV, HEA programs and wishes to allow for acceptance of that outside training to meet this requirement in the future.
The Secretary welcomes comments on what elements and safeguards should be present in an acceptable training program
for financial aid administrators. While adequate experience and training are major considerations in evaluating
compliance with this standard, the Secretary welcomes suggestions regarding any other appropriate factors that
the Department of Education should take into account in determining an individual's capability.

The Secretary proposes to clarify the factors that are considered in determining whether a financial aid office is
adequately staffed. The Secretary proposes to specify that in looking at the amount of funds administered by the institution,
the Secretary would also consider the number of students who receive any student financial assistance at the institution
as it has a direct bearing on whether an office is adequately staffed. The Secretary also proposes to add consideration
of the degree of office automation in the financial aid office. While the Secretary has always considered the extent
to which financial aid processing is automated in assessing the adequacy of financial aid offices, the Secretary
believes it is helpful to acknowledge specifically in the regulations the bearing the degree of office automation
has on the staffing levels of financial aid offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, discussions were held regarding the possible development of specific
staffing levels, such as ratios of financial aid staff to the number of financial aid recipients at an institution,
for determining the adequacy of the financial aid office of an institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs
for the first time, an institution that undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, and an institution
that has exhibited administrative difficulty with other standards in this section. The Secretary believes that
it is not necessary to prescribe specific staffing levels for participating institutions that have not experienced
administrative problems. However, the Secretary agreed to solicit comments on the need for an additional method
to assess staffing levels of other institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time has neither the experience in dealing
with large numbers of financial aid recipients nor a record of administering those programs that can be evaluated.
During discussions at the negotiated rulemaking session, it was suggested that it might be necessary to prescribe
a specific number of staff for the institution's financial aid office that could serve as a guide for determining whether
the institution can handle the volume of financial aid applications and funds it expects to receive. This standard
would be required until the Secretary is able to judge the institution's actual administration of the programs. Similarly,
there is no assurance that an institution that changes ownership will operate with the same staff and procedures and
at the same level of funding as was the case under the previous ownership. Thus, that institution's former track record
could not be relied upon to predict its continued administrative capability and there might be a need to be able to evaluate
the adequacy of current or anticipated staffing levels using specific numbers or ratios, just as the Department would
evaluate those of a new participating institution. Finally, if an institution has documented problems or indicators
of trouble in administering the Title IV, HEA programs, these problems could well be caused by inadequate staffing
levels in the institution's financial aid office. Requirements for financial aid staff to be maintained at specific
levels might need to be imposed upon the institution. To address the problems and administer the Title IV, HEA programs
correctly, it is logical to expect an institution to meet minimum staffing levels that might be adopted.

The Secretary solicits comments on other ways of measuring staff adequacy at newly participating institutions,
institutions that change ownership resulting in a change of control and participating institutions with documented
administrative problems as well as any other categories of institutions that should be subject to requirements for
specific staffing levels. The Secretary further invites comment on how such considerations as the size of the institution,
and the volume of Title IV, HEA program funds administered by the institution should determine the number or ratio
of financial aid staff that the Secretary should prescribe. For example, the Secretary wishes to know whether a reasonable
ratio of staff to applicants or recipients can be established, and, if so, what that ratio might be. The Secretary understands
the difficulty inherent in strict application of a quantitative formula; nevertheless, concern was expressed at
the negotiated rulemaking sessions about having an adequate basis on which to make fair, worthwhile, and consistent
judgments of administrative capability. The Secretary recognizes that appropriate staffing levels must include
staff not only in the financial aid office but also in the business office or other offices within an institution, and
that the use of third-party servicers and office automation have a bearing on those levels. The Secretary asks commenters
to address these factors in their recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require that to be considered administratively capable, an institution have written procedures,
or other written information covering, at a minimum, the nature and frequency of communication of information among
all the offices that have an impact on the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs and the responsibilities of
various offices with respect to the awarding and delivery of Title IV, HEA program funds and reports to the Secretary.
The Secretary encourages institutions to have specific written procedures where possible, preferably in procedural
manuals, for this purpose. However, the Secretary recognizes that some of the information might be found in catalogs,
student or administrative handbooks, or other sources. The Secretary is proposing to add these provisions because
audits and program reviews of Title IV, HEA programs administered by institutions have shown that lack of written
procedures in these key areas is frequently a contributing factor to a lack of proper controls, resulting in overawards
and inadequate accounting of expenditures. To ensure that only eligible students receive funds and in the correct
amount, and that borrowers are tracked accurately and timely, it is essential that each institution be clear about
how and when pertinent information is transmitted from one office to another. The proposed addition to the regulations
includes examples of the types of information to be transmitted. Similarly, it is critical that each office that is
responsible for the approval and disbursement or delivery of Title IV, HEA funds have in writing that office's responsibilities
and reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to clarify what constitutes division of the authorizing and disbursing or delivering functions
by adding an example. In the past, there has been virtually no real separation of these duties in some institutions;
this situation has presented an opportunity for significant abuse. It is important that two different individuals
authorize and disburse or deliver payment, and that an individual performing one of these functions not have control
over the work activities of the person or persons performing the other. To guard against collusion, it is also critical
that the individuals not be members of the same family or exercise substantial control over the institution through
a combined ownership interest in the institution. The terms 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
substantial control
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ownership interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are currently defined in &sect;668.13. The Secretary considers two individuals to exercise substantial control
through a ``combined'' ownership interest if the individuals hold 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
together
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at least a 25 percent ownership interest in the institution. Thus, an institution would be precluded from having one
individual with a 10 percent ownership interest who awards Title IV, HEA program assistance and another individual
with a 15 percent ownership interest who disburses the funds. This concept is designed to allow for those employees
who participate to a moderate degree in a profit-sharing plan to be employed in one of the capacities described in this
provision without having a detrimental impact on the institution's administrative capability. Finally, the Secretary
wishes to clarify that, under both current regulations and the proposed regulations, it is acceptable for a check
that is to be disbursed or delivered to a student by another office to pass through the office that authorizes payment,
as long as the office that authorizes payment does no more than deliver the check to the office responsible for disbursement
or delivery to the student.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to make explicit that record-keeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a basic standard of administrative capability. Those new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that do not have adequate record-keeping capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be approved to participate in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The record-keeping capability of participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions would be evaluated when the institutions seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
renewal of their program participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to revise the satisfactory progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards to require that the maximum time frame for completion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an undergraduate program be no longer than 150 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published length of the educational program and that increments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the maximum time frame not exceed the lesser of one academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year or one-half the published length of the educational program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment of the maximum time frame must, as usual, take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account a student's enrollment status. Thus, an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that offers a four-year degree program (as listed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's catalog) would have to establish a maximum time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frame of no more than six years for completion of the program by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a full-time student. The time frame could be proportionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer for a half-time student. The Secretary emphasizes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement would set an upper limit on the period of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which a student may receive Title IV, HEA program aid. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would not be required to expel or otherwise remove a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student from the educational program after the expiration of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum time frame (unless, of course, the institution has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar requirement for students who do not receive Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program assistance). The Secretary has a longstanding policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under which 150 percent of the length of an educational program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is considered to be a reasonable period in which a serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student should be able to complete the program. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notes that this proposed time frame is also consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposals made by the NPRM implementing the Student Right-to-Know 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in section 485(a) of the HEA (57 FR 30826). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not believe that Title IV, HEA program aid should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be provided beyond the point at which a student can reasonably be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to complete his or her educational objective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to expand and clarify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for reporting information about possible fraud or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illegal misconduct related to the Title IV, HEA programs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations would eliminate the current provision for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to refer suspected instances of fraud or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criminal misconduct involving Title IV, HEA program assistance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State or local law enforcement agency rather than the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inspector General (OIG), if more appropriate. Instead, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations would require the institution to notify only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OIG. The proposed regulations would also remove a related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement_that the institution report to the OIG, for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year, all relevant referrals to State or local law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement agencies, as this would no longer be necessary if all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referrals were made directly to the OIG. Upon receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, the OIG will notify and work with the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials to resolve the issue. The Secretary is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend this section to streamline the referral process and reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the burden of reporting information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, under this provision governing the reporting of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances of suspected fraud and criminal misconduct, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions are required to report only information regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants for Title IV, HEA program assistance. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed change would expand the reporting requirement with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to both the types of misconduct to be reported and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals and entities involved in the misconduct. In addition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the information currently required, an institution would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to report information regarding illegal conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving the eligibility and funding of the institution and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students through Title IV, HEA programs believed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to have been committed by any employee, third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. This provision would specify that illegal conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would include possible fraud, misrepresentation, conversion or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breach of fiduciary responsibility, or any other illegal conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes it is important to investigate any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible illegal misconduct (i.e., misconduct where formal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criminal charges have not been brought) in addition to possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criminal misconduct. The intent of this expansion is to specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that institutions should report not only acts that constitute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fraud or criminal conduct, but any and all other illegal conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving Title IV, HEA programs in which an employee or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer might have engaged.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to modifying and expanding some of the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability standards, and making others explicit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary proposes to expand the administrative capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards to include the general areas that SPREs will review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when they become operational. The Secretary realizes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPRE review standards must be developed in consultation with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions located in the State and will apply only to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that trigger reviews; therefore, those standards may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differ greatly from those proposed here for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating an institution's administrative capability. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary believes that these areas of review have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant bearing on an institution's administrative capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and therefore should be incorporated in the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary's overriding concern is that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have sufficient information on which to make a determination that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a new or currently participating institution is administering or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is capable of administering the Title IV, HEA programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiently, effectively, and correctly. With this in mind, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary solicits comments on specific ways to quantify these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions (for example, what a ``significant number of students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with special needs'' is) and whether each of these added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements should be made applicable to all institutions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether these provisions should be made applicable only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that meet specific criteria or thresholds, e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions with short-term programs, a history of high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal rates, high default rates, student complaints, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the Secretary is proposing to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that enroll significant numbers of students with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special needs to have and implement a plan that provides access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to adequate support services for those students. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that an institution that cannot provide adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peripheral support should not enroll those special-needs students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in significant numbers. In evaluating administrative capability, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary has looked historically at withdrawal rates. High 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal rates often result in refund and default problems in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FFEL programs. Some institutions have high withdrawal rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they have recruited students who were not able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete the program. Student withdrawal for academic reasons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been addressed by changes to the ability-to-benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions: students who do not have a high school diploma or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized equivalent now need to pass an independently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered, approved examination. However, other students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been admitted have had the academic capability to succeed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but have been unable to complete the program because of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors, such as lack of child care, or changes in child care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements, or lack of adequate transportation. Some of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiators provided the Secretary with examples of students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could not complete a course of study because of a lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about how to access adequate support services, who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise may not have enrolled in those programs if accurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about the restricted availability of those services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had been disclosed. For example, if a school enrolls a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant number of students who have small children and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, need someone to look after their children while they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are in classes and studying, or students who have no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation of their own, it is incumbent upon the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to work with these students to ensure they have access to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ancillary services required in order for them to complete their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or training. The institution may, but need not, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually provide the specific services, such as child care, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must, at a minimum, provide adequate guidance and access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable their students to overcome barriers to attendance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is proposing that affected institutions have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan, which they may be asked to submit, to demonstrate that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet this provision. However, the Secretary is interested in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving suggestions about other ways to address the problem of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that recruit and enroll significant numbers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who need support services without informing those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students about access to the support services. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicits comments regarding how to determine what constitutes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant number'' of students with special needs and what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special needs should be included. Further, the Secretary would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
like to receive proposals for alternate means of addressing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to require each institution to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for receiving, investigating, and resolving student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require that if the stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectives of an educational program are to prepare students for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gainful employment, the institution must be able to show that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a reasonable relationship between the length of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program and entry level requirements for employment. In addition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to supporting the length of a program, the institution should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to substantiate the need for the number of hours of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training. The Secretary proposes to consider the relationship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the quantity of training provided in the program and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry-level requirements to be reasonable if the number of clock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours in the program does not exceed by more than 50 percent any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State requirement for the minimum number of clock hours necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to train the student in the occupation for which the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares the student. For example, the Secretary is aware of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that sought approval of a 600-hour program when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state in which the institution is located requires only 40 hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of training for entry level positions for which the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided training. The Secretary believes that in situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as this, the onus is on the institution to demonstrate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of the longer program. The Secretary believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessive length of programs requires a student to incur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional unnecessary debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A corollary requirement is that the need for the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided is established. Over the past several years, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has been made aware of many schools that have provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three to six months of training for entry-level jobs, some of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which required no external training before employment, as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers have internal training programs or provide on-the-job 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training. As a basic tenet of student financial assistance is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable students who would not otherwise be able to afford needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training or education to enroll in an appropriate program, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that if an institution is administering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs adequately, it can demonstrate that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training it provides is needed. The Secretary solicits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestions on the most appropriate documentation to show the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for the training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add to the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability standards the requirement that the institution make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on job availability and state licensing requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to students in occupational, professional and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vocational educational programs. The Secretary believes that, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order for a prospective occupational, professional or vocational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education student and financial aid applicant to make an informed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision about enrollment and use of student financial assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a particular program, the applicant must have access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate, up-to-date information on the job market for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field, and the availability of specific jobs for which he or she 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be adequately prepared after completion of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the applicant should have access to information on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent to which the educational or training program addresses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state licensing standards, so the informed student can determine, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with reasonable assurance, that necessary topics are covered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program and the extent to which additional information, not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for state licensure, is covered. The Secretary notes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this information may be obtained by the institution from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other Federal and State sources, such as Employment Service or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State occupational coordinating committees. An institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be required to produce this information on its own. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to include within the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability standards a requirement that the institution have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advertising, promotion, and student recruitment practices that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurately reflect the content and objectives of the educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs offered by the institution. The Secretary believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to administer the Title IV, HEA programs in a responsible manner, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution must advertise its programs and the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance available in an accurate manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide all required program and fiscal reports and financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements in a timely manner. The Secretary believes strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that adequate, timely submission of accurate reports is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential element in the proper administration of the Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs. The failure to meet requirements for submission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports is an indication that an institution's administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability is impaired.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to include as a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative standard the requirement that an institution have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no outstanding liabilities owed to the Secretary unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has made satisfactory arrangements to repay those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities and is honoring those arrangements. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that unless a participating institution demonstrates it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has met all its programmatic, contractual, and fiscal obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the past, and has taken positive steps to rectify problems and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities in the past, there is no reason to presume that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has the capability and willingness to administer the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs responsibly in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to take into account whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant problems have been identified in final reports and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations issued by the Secretary, the OIG, accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, SPREs, guaranty agencies, and State authorizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies and findings in criminal, civil, or administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings, in addition to financial and compliance audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports and program review reports, in assessing an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. The Secretary believes that pertinent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information from any of the agencies or proceedings identified is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant to determining whether an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administratively capable. An institution should be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administratively capable only if there is no evidence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant problems in those reviews or proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add to the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability standards, the prohibition against debarments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspensions, and causes of debarment or suspension under E.O. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12549 and the FAR, 48 CFR subpart 9.4. The Secretary proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend this section to provide that an institution would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered administratively capable if (1) cause exists for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debarring the institution under 34 CFR 85.305, or for suspending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution under 34 CFR 85.405, (2) any principal (as that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term is used in 34 CFR part 85) of the institution is debarred or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended, or (3) the institution is an affiliate (as that term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is used in 34 CFR part 85) of any person so debarred or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended. Under these changes, the Secretary would not certify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the administrative capability of an institution that fits into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any of these categories. The Secretary would not permit such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to begin participation in a Title IV, HEA program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Secretary would require a participating institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rectify the problem that adversely affects the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. A participating institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inability or unwillingness to rectify the problem would warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiation of an emergency action, limitation, suspension, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination proceeding against the institution under subpart G. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary expects that such a proceeding would be combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a debarment or suspension proceeding under 34 CFR part 85. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes are needed to establish appropriate safeguards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect the Title IV, HEA programs when serious questions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raised about the honesty and lawfulness of the conduct of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's owners, officers, directors, management, employees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or affiliates whose duties involve the administration of or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence over those programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require that an institution comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any standards regarding completion and placement rates and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass rates on State licensing examinations established by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State in which an institution is located as a standard of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. The Secretary supports the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of appropriate standards by each State, as individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States will be able to address local concerns and conditions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the development of standards. In the absence of such a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, the Secretary believes an institution must comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate standards regarding completion rates, placement rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pass rates on required State examinations, as established by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary, in consultation with institutions located in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require as a standard for full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs that institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have default rates that do not exceed 20 percent for the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs, and default rates that do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exceed 15 percent for the Federal Perkins Loan program. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs, a 20 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trigger is currently used as an indicator of impaired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. For the Federal Perkins Loan program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary has used a 20 percent trigger as an indicator of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impaired administrative capability. The Secretary is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to change this figure to 15 percent for consistency with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory requirement of section 461(g) of the HEA that requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution with a cohort default rate of 15 percent in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Perkins Loan program to establish a default management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan pursuant to regulations. Under this proposal, institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying for participation under a change of ownership or for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
renewal of their participation with default rates exceeding these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed amounts would be provisionally certified for a lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability if no other serious administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability problems were identified that warranted denying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. The Secretary notes that, under this proposal, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution applying for a renewal of participation that has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default rate under the Federal Stafford Loan programs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds 20 percent could submit information demonstrating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigating circumstances as provided in &sect;668.15 of current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to demonstrate that the institution's default rate is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a basis for denial of full participation. If no other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious administrative capability problems were identified that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warrant denying the application for full participation, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution with default rates over these triggers could receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full participation if it successfully showed that those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigating circumstances existed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Secretary is proposing that an institution would not be considered administratively capable if
it has a withdrawal rate of more than 33 percent. This change from the current regulations, under which the Secretary
considers withdrawal rates of more than 33 percent as an indicator of problems in administrative capability, would
become, like the other standards in this section, absolute requirements rather than mere indicators. The calculation
of this withdrawal rate is currently made using the formula on the application for participation in the Title IV, HEA
programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is proposing these changes to the current default rate and withdrawal rate requirements because the
Secretary believes that these rates are appropriate measures of an institution's past administrative performance;
an institution that administers the Title IV, HEA programs correctly will, absent mitigating circumstances for
its Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs default rate, have default rates and withdrawal rates below these
percentages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary understands that some currently participating institutions have rates in excess of these levels.
Therefore, the Secretary anticipates that when these institutions next undergo a reevaluation of their institutional
eligibility, administrative capability, and financial responsibility, some of them would be determined not to
be administratively capable purely for failure to meet these standards, even if they meet all the other financial
responsibility and administrative capability standards in these proposed regulations. In those cases, if there
are no other significant problems, these institutions could be granted provisional certification so they could
continue to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs for a limited time on a limited basis to allow them to bring their
default or withdrawal rates or both down to an acceptable level. However, an institution with a high withdrawal rate
applying for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time would not be approved to participate in
the Title IV, HEA programs. In addition to these default rates the Secretary plans to establish an appropriate default
rate applicable to the FDSL Program and solicits comments on what that should be. For example, comments are requested
on whether FDSL Program default rate thresholds should be developed to take into consideration students who are using
income contingent repayment.

Because of the changes described above in proposed &sect;668.16 concerning the effect of default and withdrawal
rates on an institution's administrative capability, the remaining provisions in current &sect;668.15 would address
default reduction measures for institutions with high Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS default rates. Therefore,
the Secretary proposes to redesignate current &sect;668.15 as &sect;668.17 and rename it ``Default reduction measures.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to clarify that the Secretary notifies an institution of its Federal Stafford loan and Federal
SLS cohort default rate if that rate exceeds 20 percent for any fiscal year before the Secretary takes an action against
the institution. This change merely reflects the Secretary's current practice.

The Secretary proposes to remove the option to require an institution with a Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS
cohort default rate that exceeds 20 percent for any fiscal year to submit to the Secretary and guaranty agencies the
specific information described in current &sect;668.15(b)(2)(ii) concerning pass rates, job placement rates,
and completion rates. These changes are consistent with earlier statutory and regulatory revisions to current &sect;668.15
and because the Secretary rarely asks institutions to submit this information. The Secretary would reserve the right
to request any information the Secretary deems necessary to make a preliminary determination as to the appropriate
action to be taken by the Secretary regarding the institution.

Default Management Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to clarify requirements for implementation of default management plans for institutions
with Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS cohort default rates greater than 20 percent for any fiscal year. The Secretary
has required implementation of a default management plan for institutions with cohort default rates greater than
20 percent since the implementation of the default reduction initiative in final regulations published June 5, 1989
(54 FR 24114). In the preamble to the June 5, 1989, final regulations, the Secretary stated that, in accordance with
current &sect;668.15(e), an institution with a default rate over 20 percent could be required to implement a default
management plan. The proposed provision specifies that, for an institution with a Federal Stafford loan and Federal
SLS cohort default rates greater than 20 percent or less than or equal to 40 percent for any fiscal year, the institution
would have to submit a default management plan that implements the measures described in appendix D to this part. An
institution could only implement a default management plan that deviates from the measures in appendix D if the institution
submits a justification for the deviation that is approved by the Secretary. An institution with a Federal Stafford
loan and Federal SLS cohort default rate that exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year, and, therefore, is subject to
a limitation, suspension, or termination action under subpart G, would have to implement all of the default reduction
measures described in appendix D to this part no later than 60 days after the institution receives the Secretary's
notification of the institutions cohort default rate. The institution would not be required to submit any written
plans to the Secretary or a guaranty agency unless specifically requested to do so by the Secretary or guaranty agency.

End of Participation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 435(a)(2) of the HEA provides that an institution's participation in the FFEL programs ends if the Secretary
determines that the institution's cohort default rate for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which the
Secretary has determined the institution's rate is equal to or greater than the applicable threshold rates. Section
435(a)(2)(B) of the HEA sets the threshold rate for fiscal year 1994 and all subsequent fiscal years at 25 percent.
Consistent with current regulations, institutions may appeal such loss of participation by demonstrating that
mitigating circumstances as found in current &sect;668.15 are present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, an institution may not participate in the FFEL programs beginning eight calendar days after the date the
Secretary notifies the institution that its cohort default rate exceeds the specified thresholds. The Secretary
proposes to change this provision to require that an institution may not participate in the FFEL program beginning
with the date that the institution receives notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds
the specified thresholds. The Secretary does not believe it is appropriate to continue to allow an institution that
has lost its participation due to a high default rate to have the benefit of further Title IV, HEA program funds unless
it successfully appeals. The Secretary proposes to make corresponding changes throughout this section.

Appeal Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Technical Amendments of 1993 amended section 435(a) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) of the HEA as those sections relate to institutional appeals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of cohort default rates. These amendments are not reflected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this NPRM but will be addressed separately. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes to remove the provision that provides that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may appeal its loss of participation in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs under the provisions of this section on the grounds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution has reduced its cohort default rate for each of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the two most recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated a cohort default rate for that institution by 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the amount by which its cohort default rate for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous year exceeds the applicable threshold percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in this section. This provision is no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable because it was limited to notices of loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility that were received by an institution in the fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year that ended September 30, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations allow an institution to appeal its loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of participation in the FFEL programs under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section on the grounds that, for any twenty-four month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period ending not more than six months prior to the date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution submits its appeal, two-thirds or more of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's students who are enrolled on at least a half-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis are individuals from disadvantaged economic backgrounds as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by documentary evidence submitted by the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as a Pell Grant Index of zero, or an AGI of less than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poverty level, as determined by criteria developed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Health and Human Services. The Secretary proposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the term ``such as'' be eliminated to reflect the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice; i.e., the institution must establish the grounds for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its appeal based only on the information specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The Department would only accept the specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence listed in the regulations although the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations suggest that other evidence is acceptable. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change reflects the current practice of the Secretary. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary solicits comment on other acceptable forms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable documentation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reflect this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Definitions applicable to this section would be revised to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 435(m) of the HEA. In accordance with the statute, as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the past, for any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
former students at the institution enter repayment on Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stafford or Federal SLS program loans received for attendance at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution, the cohort default rate is the percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those current and former students who enter repayment in that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal year on Federal Stafford or Federal SLS program loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received for attendance at that institution who default before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of the following fiscal year. Formerly, for any fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year in which fewer than 30 of the institution's current and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
former students entered repayment on a Federal Stafford or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal SLS loans received for attendance at the institution, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate was the average over the three most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal years of the rates calculated in the manner described for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and former students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter repayment on a Federal Stafford or Federal SLS program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan. The HEA now requires that, for any fiscal year in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fewer than 30 of the institution's current and former students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter repayment, the cohort default rate is the percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those current and former students who entered repayment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Stafford loans or Federal SLS loans in any of the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most recent fiscal years who default before the end of the fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year in which they entered repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Amendments of 1993 changed section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA to make clear that the issue of improper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan servicing is only part of the appeal process and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relate to the Secretary's initial release of cohort default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates. Thus, in issuing the rates initially, the Secretary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not obligated to consider allegations of improper loan servicing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to reflect this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change by removing the requirement that the Secretary must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclude any loans that, due to improper servicing or collection, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 435(m) of the HEA requires the addition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that a Federal SLS loan not be considered to enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment until after the borrower has ceased to be enrolled in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational program leading to a degree or certificate at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible institution on at least a half-time basis (as determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the institution) and ceased to be in a period of forbearance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires the guaranty agency to provide that information to the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments of 1992 added section 484B to the HEA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an institution to have in place, as of July 23, 1992, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fair and equitable institutional refund policy as promulgated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that section. The fair and equitable refund requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed by law are similar to the fair and equitable refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements prescribed by &sect;682.606 of the FFEL program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations for institutions that participate in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The HEA extends this requirement to institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating in any Title IV, HEA program and makes various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this fair and equitable refund policy, an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must make a refund of unearned tuition, fees, room and board, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other charges to a student who received Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance (including PLUS loans received on behalf of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student) if the student does not register for the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment for which the student was charged or if the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdraws, drops out, or is expelled from the institution before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completing the period of enrollment for which he or she was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interpretation of the applicability of a fair and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equitable refund policy was the subject of extensive discussions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among the negotiators. The HEA specifically mandates a refund to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any student who received Title IV HEA program assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, at issue during the negotiations was the fairness and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equity in having a refund policy for students who receive Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program assistance that is different from the refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy for those students enrolled in the same educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program who do not receive Title IV, HEA program assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several negotiators felt that requiring institutions to apply the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund requirements found in this proposed section to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who attend an institution would be an unauthorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intrusion by the Secretary into the administrative decisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution. Many negotiators felt that compliance with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund requirement that is applicable to all students would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
too costly for an institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary proposes to define a fair and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equitable refund policy only with respect to students who receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program assistance. Although the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to limit the scope of this provision to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients, under this proposed provision an institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be prohibited from adopting these refund requirements for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a written statement containing its refund policy to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective students and make its policy known to currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled students. This proposal is based upon requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently prescribed by &sect;682.606 of the FFEL program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to expand this FFEL provision to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the written statement must be clear and conspicuous and must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include information on the allocation of refunds and repayments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to sources of aid. In keeping with current FFEL program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, the Secretary proposes that the written statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include examples of the application of the refund policy. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement would be met if the institution informs students in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the written statement that examples are available and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution makes the examples readily available to the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the current FFEL program regulations, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to require an institution to provide the written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement to prospective students. Section 668.41(b) of current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations defines a ``prospective student'' as an individual who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has contacted an institution participating in any Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program for the purpose of requesting information concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admission to the institution. The Secretary believes that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student is a ``prospective student'' if he or she is not enrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an institution and has not entered into any contractual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement or incurred a financial obligation to attend an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to provide this written statement to a student prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the earlier of the student's enrollment or the execution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student's enrollment agreement. If the institution's refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy changes, the institution would have to ensure that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students are made aware of the new policy and advise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently enrolled students of any changes that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to apply to those students for their current enrollment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that some institutions have assessed excessive equipment charges that have increased the
total aid received. For example, some students have been charged as much as ten or fifteen times an institution's documented
equipment costs for kits students were required to purchase. If the calculation of a refund includes equipment charges
with such an extreme price mark-up, the amount of money an institution would be permitted to keep is greatly inflated.
To help curb this abuse, the Secretary is proposing to require an institution to publish in its school catalog or other
information provided to its students, the cost to the student of required supplies and equipment. Further, the Secretary
proposes to require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to substantiate to Department officials, upon the request of the Secretary, that the costs are reasonably
related to the costs of providing the supplies and equipment to students. This provision would not require the institution
to provide this cost substantiation to students, but would permit the Secretary to obtain information regarding
the cost of required supplies and equipment to determine whether an abuse in this area is occurring or has occurred.
For example, this information may be routinely reviewed during a program review. If the charges for equipment and
supplies appear to be unreasonable, the institution would be required to show that its charges were reasonably related
to the cost of providing those items. Under this proposal, an institution would not be expected to provide this information
to the Secretary as a regularly scheduled submission, but only upon request from the Department of Education.

Fair and Equitable Refund Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 484B of the HEA defines a fair and equitable refund policy to be one that provides for at least the largest of
the amounts provided under: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The requirements of applicable State law; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The specific refund requirements established by the institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency
and approved by the Secretary; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation described in the statute for students attending the institution for the first time, except that
this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation does not apply for any student whose withdrawal date is after the 60 percent point in time in the
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary intends to clarify that an accrediting agency's refund policy must contain specific standards. Refund
``guidelines'' developed by an accrediting agency (for example, an accrediting agency refund policy that only requires
an institution to develop its own fair and equitable refund policy) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be considered to have standards. Obviously, an institution would not be considered to be in compliance with
a State's or an approved accrediting agency's refund policy if the institution adopts a refund policy that is merely
similar to the State's or accrediting agency's but does not incorporate all the required standards. This policy is
consistent with the current provisions of the FFEL program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary recognizes that there may be situations where an institution's State and accrediting agency do not
have specific refund policies. If a student is not entitled to a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund, no specific standard would then exist under the law to ensure that the student received a fair and equitable
refund. Because the Secretary believes that all recipients of Title IV, HEA program assistance should be treated
fairly, the Secretary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to require an institution to provide a refund to a student that is the larger of the institution's refund
policy or the specific refund standards contained in appendix A to this part if an institution's State and accrediting
agency do not have refund standards and the student is not entitled to a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund. The NPRM published on January 24, 1994 to implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency provisions in subpart 2 of part H of the HEA proposes that the Secretary will not recognize an accrediting
agency unless the agency has a refund policy that provides for a fair and equitable refund to a student. The Secretary
notes that if this provision of the accreditation agency NPRM is adopted in final regulations, there would not be a
need for the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A requirement once all accrediting agencies have been reviewed and recognized by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The refund policy proposed to be adopted as appendix A is derived from the guidelines developed by the National Association
of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO). Currently, under the FFEL program regulations, an institution
must follow the guidelines developed by NACUBO and restated in appendix A to the FFEL program regulations (or refund
policy standards set by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another association of institutions of postsecondary education and approved by the Secretary) if neither an institution's
State nor its accrediting agency have refund standards. While the NACUBO standards identify policy standards that
institutions should have for the refund of student charges, the Secretary's proposed appendix A establishes policy
standards that institutions must have for the refund of student charges. The Secretary has always considered these
standards as mandatory for purposes of the FFEL program regulations and is, therefore, making that interpretation
clear in these proposed regulations. Further, the Secretary's proposed appendix A to this part would mandate the
percentage of tuition charges that must be returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a student who withdraws from an institution at various intervals during the refund period. In the development of
the actual refund calculation for this policy, the Secretary adapted a proportionate calculation that is similar
to refund policies used by proprietary institutions. The Secretary believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this refund schedule provides a fairer allocation of resources between the institution and the Title IV, HEA programs
than exists under the shorter refund periods often found at traditional colleges and universities. This proposed
refund policy is not normally as generous to the student as the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund policy prescribed by the statute, because the affected students would not be first time students and, therefore,
would not be entitled to the full protection of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund policy. Under the standards in appendix A, a student who submits written notice of withdrawal up to one week
before the first day of class would receive a refund of 100 percent of tuition charges. The refund would be reduced to
at least 90 percent if the student submits written notice of withdrawal between the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the 100 percent period and the first 10 percent of the period for which the student was charged. A student would receive
at least a 50 percent refund if he or she withdraws between the first 10 percent and the first 25 percent of the period
for which the student was charged. Finally, a student would receive at least a 25 percent refund if he or she withdraws
between the first 25 percent and the first 50 percent of the period for which the student was charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a part of the refund policy in proposed appendix A, the Secretary would allow an institution to subtract from the
refund to a student any charges for equipment (including books and supplies) if there is a separate charge for the equipment
and the student actually obtains the equipment but the student fails to return the equipment within 20 days after his
or her withdrawal. This provision is discussed further in the explanation on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution must determine whether a student withdrew prior to the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment
for which the student has been charged when determining whether the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation is applicable to a student. The Secretary proposes to define ``the 60 percent point in time in the
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' based upon whether the educational program in which
the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is enrolled is measured in credit hours or clock hours. In the case of an educational program that is measured in credit
hours, this point would be the point in calendar time when 60 percent of the period of enrollment for which the student
has been charged has elapsed. In the case of an educational program that is measured in clock hours, this point would
be the point in time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the student completes 60 percent of the clock hours scheduled for the period of enrollment for which the student
is charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, if the student's period of enrollment in an educational program that is measured in credit hours is scheduled
to last 5 months (20 weeks), the 60 percent point of the period is at 12 weeks. However, in the case of a program measured
in clock hours, the Secretary believes that it is more accurate to use the number of completed clock hours to determine
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of enrollment. For instance, if the student is scheduled to complete 900 clock hours, the 60 percent point
of the period of enrollment occurs when the student has completed 540 clock hours. The Secretary wishes to emphasize
that the definition of the determination of the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which the student
has been charged is different from the determination of ``the portion of the period of period of enrollment for which
the student has been charged that remains'' that is used to calculate the refund after the institution has determined
that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation is to be used. The proposed definition of the latter term will be discussed later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the largest refund to a student, the Secretary proposes to require an institution to determine the
largest refund for each student. An institution would not be permitted to determine which refund is generally the
most generous and use that refund calculation for all students. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that current computer technology enables an institution to automate this determination through
the use of computer software.

The Secretary notes that although the statutory requirements for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 regulations found in the FFEL program regulations, institutions have been advised to follow guidance given for implementation
of the FFEL program regulations as ``safe-harbor'' guidance for implementation of the statutory requirements for

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds. The Secretary intends that final regulations for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds developed as a result of this NPRM and any guidance given for implementation of these regulations will replace
the required 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund policy for an institution that is required to use a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund policy because the institution has a cohort default rate that exceeds 30 percent under the FFEL programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund,'' as defined in statute, is required for a student attending an institution for the first time, unless another
applicable refund is greater. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund may not be less than that portion of the tuition, fees, room, board, and other charges assessed the student by
the institution equal to the portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that remains
on the withdrawal date. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund is then rounded downward to the nearest 10 percent of that period. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund is then reduced for any unpaid charges and a reasonable administrative fee. The administrative fee may not
exceed the lesser of one hundred dollars or five percent of the tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges assessed
the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to permit institutions to subtract certain amounts of institutional charges from the refund
to the student. The Secretary wishes to clarify that these proposed regulations would permit an institution to subtract
charges or portion of charges from a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund only if the charges are included in the calculation of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the statute, an institution may subtract any unpaid charges owed to the institution by the student. The Secretary
is proposing to define unpaid charges by using the definition for an ``unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment''
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 8, 1993 (58 FR 32188). Although those final regulations discussed the unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment
as being excluded from the amount the institution may retain for institutional charges, rather than for the purpose
of excluding any unpaid balance from the refund to the student, the Secretary believes it is appropriate to adopt the
same definition to define these unpaid charges. In accordance with the current regulations, a student's scheduled
cash payment would be defined as the amount of institutional charges that is not paid for by financial aid. An institution
could count any late disbursements of Title IV aid as financial aid for this purpose (i.e., the amount of the late disbursement
would not be included as part of the student's scheduled cash payment.) Any amount of the scheduled cash payment that
has not been paid would be the amount of unpaid charges owed by the student. The treatment of unpaid charges for refunds
other than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds is addressed later in this discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute also permits an institution to subtract a reasonable administrative fee from the refund owed to a student.
This administrative fee must be a real charge and documented as such. An institution may not automatically subtract
the lesser of five percent of the tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges assessed the student or one hundred
dollars if no such administrative fee actually exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add to the list of permitted subtractions from the refund to a student any application fee
charged by the institution. The Secretary believes that an application fee is a fee incurred separately from a student's
charges for an enrollment period, and therefore, should not be included in the refund to the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for institutions whose students are issued meal credits that can be spent irregularly throughout the
enrollment period (e.g., coupons or meal tokens) the Secretary proposes to allow an institution to deduct from the
refund owed under this paragraph the portion of ``board'' charges (i.e., meal tickets) that has been expended by the
student that exceeds the portion attributable to the period for which the student attended at the time of withdrawal.
For example, if a student withdrew at the 50 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which the student has
been charged but had used 60 percent of the meal tickets, the institution could subtract from the refund to the student
the value of the meal tickets attributable to that 10 percent of the period of enrollment that the student did not attend.
If a student used less than the attributable value of the meal tickets at the time of his or her withdrawal, an institution
would not be permitted to subtract any amount from the refund to the student. An institution would not be permitted
to subtract any amount from the refund to the student in cases where students have unlimited use of meal tickets.

The Secretary intends to continue the current policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the inclusion of books, supplies, and other equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation consistent with guidance given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to institutions that were required to use a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy because the institution had a default rate that exceeds 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent and was required to calculate a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student who received a loan under the FFEL programs. As is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently the case, an institution is required to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full amount of charges for equipment in the calculation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund if a separate charge exists for the equipment by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution or if the institution requires the student to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase the equipment from a certain vendor. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that by charging students a separate equipment charge or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by requiring students to purchase the equipment from a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor (for example, a school book store) the equipment charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are being mandated by the institution and should be treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional costs. In effect, the institution is the sole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source of the equipment. If an institution does not have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate charge for equipment and the student has the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasing the equipment from more than one source, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would not have to include the equipment charge in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation. An institution would have to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to demonstrate that its students have the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasing the equipment from other sources that are easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessible to the student and that the students are advised that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an option is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to allow an institution to subtract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the refund to a student any charges for equipment (including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
books and supplies) that a student could have returned for credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but did not do so. Under this provision, there would have to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a separate charge for the equipment, and the student must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually have obtained the equipment but failed to return the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment within 20 days after his or her withdrawal. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision was suggested by one of the negotiators and is based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon California law. By consensus of the negotiators, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision would be extended to situations where the equipment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies are sold by an affiliate or related entity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. If the student does not return the equipment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution could subtract from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund owed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student the documented cost to the institution of equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued to the student. The student would be liable for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the amount of the student's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, if some or all of the equipment is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually received by the student, the institution would have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation 100 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount paid for that portion of the equipment. Further, if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution gives a student the option to return the equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution would not be permitted to subtract the cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equipment from the refund to the student if the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chooses to return the equipment and does so within 20 days of his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or her withdrawal. The Secretary believes that 20 days provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student with a sufficient period of time to return equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without delaying the refund to the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that any equipment returned by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student must be in good condition allowing for reasonable wear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and tear. The Secretary notes that there may be restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under State laws that prevent an institution from accepting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned equipment due to health and sanitary reasons. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions might also limit the return of equipment. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, a workbook that has been written in or a damaged text 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
book might not be reusable. The Secretary solicits comments on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether this provision should be expanded to identify other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that could affect the institution's ability to reissue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that, because an institution must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the charges listed above in the calculation of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund and is then permitted to subtract the charges or a portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the charges from this refund, in many cases it appears that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution could retain more than the actual charge to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student. For example, if an institution that charges a $100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative fee calculates a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund to a student, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the $100 charge would be refunded to the student in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund formula, and a portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charge would be retained by the institution. Yet, in addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution could then be permitted to subtract the full $100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the refund to the student. The Secretary requests comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on whether it may be more appropriate to require institutions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclude these charges from the refund calculation entirely rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than subtracting the charge after performing the calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also requests comment on whether some other means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be adopted to eliminate this potential ``double counting'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of determining a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to exclude from the ``room charges'' that are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the refund calculation, any room charges for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-campus housing that are passed through the institution in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their entirety to an entity that is not under the control of, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to, or affiliated with the institution. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that an institution may enter into an agreement with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an outside agency to provide lodging for students. Under such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement, the institution is merely a conduit that passes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
room charges along to the other entity, yet those charges appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as institutional charges on student accounts. In these cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the independence of the entities and the students' continuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to occupy the housing after the students withdraw warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exclusion of the room charges from the refund calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also proposes to exclude from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation charges for group health insurance that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory for all students in the calculation of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund so long as the coverage remains in effect for the students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the period for which the student was charged. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary notes that the inclusion of these group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance charges in the refund calculation could cancel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance coverage that might otherwise be extended to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student beyond the student's withdrawal date.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to define a student attending an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution for the first time as a student who has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously attended at least one class at the institution. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student who received a refund of 100 percent of his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition and fees (less any permitted administrative fee) under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's refund policy for previous attendance at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would also be considered a first-time student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that a first-time student at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is a student who is attending that institution, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to any institution, for the first time. Therefore, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student has not previously attended at least one class at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific institution, the Secretary would consider the student to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be attending that institution for the first time. If a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfers to another institution, he or she would count as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first-time student at the new institution, if he or she has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously attended at least one class at the new institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a student attends an institution, withdraws from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution (and receives less than a 100 percent refund), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then returns to the same institution, the student would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as a first-time student for his or her second period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendance. The Secretary believes that if a student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously received a 100 percent refund at an institution, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of this definition, the student should be treated as if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
he or she had not previously attended the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that a student should remain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first-time student until the student withdraws from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution after attending at least one class, or completes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of enrollment for which he or she has been charged, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever occurs first. Therefore, the shortest amount of time a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student could remain a first-time student is the period until he 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or she withdraws after attending one class. The longest amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time a student could remain a first-time student is the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until his or her completion of the period of enrollment for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
he or she has been charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to adopt for all the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs the requirement currently found in the FFEL program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that an institution's payment to a lender of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of a refund allocable to a Title IV, HEA program cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be delayed because of a delay in the return of equipment. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision would apply to the portion of the refund due to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the actual calculation of a refund under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund provisions of section 484B of the HEA, the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund is based on ``the portion of the period of enrollment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the student has been charged that remains [after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student stopped attending].'' Under the law, ``the portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains'' in an educational program measured in credit hours is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by dividing the number of weeks that the student did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not complete by the total number of weeks in the program. For a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock-hour program, the determination is made by dividing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of clock hours not completed by the total number of clock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours. For a correspondence program, the determination is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by dividing the number of lessons not completed by the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of lessons. The Secretary has merely repeated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language here. The Secretary would like to note that ``the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been charged that remains'' is used to calculate the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund to a student and is distinct from the determination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student has been charged that is used to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation is applicable. The definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the student has been charged'' was discussed earlier in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary.

Period of Enrollment for Which the Student Has Been Charged
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, the Secretary proposes to define ``the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment for which the student has been charged,'' as the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period for which an institution charges a student. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes to establish a minimum period of enrollment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the student has been charged to prevent institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from establishing very short periods to minimize the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges that would be subject to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds for first-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students. In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in credit hours and uses semesters, trimesters, quarters, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other academic terms, the minimum period would be the semester, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trimester, quarter, or other academic term. In the case of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program that is measured in credit hours and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use semesters, trimesters, quarters, or other academic terms, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational program that is measured in clock hours, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum period would be the lesser of the length of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program or an academic year. This proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition is based on the current policy for the FFEL programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that sets minimum certification periods for loans. This policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was designed partly to prevent institutions from circumventing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the refund provisions currently found in &sect;668.22. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comments on whether other safeguards are needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent institutions from circumventing the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary notes that there may be institutions that use different periods for categories of charges. For example,
an institution may charge by the academic year for tuition, but by the academic term for books and supplies. The Secretary,
therefore, proposes that, for purposes of determining refunds under this section, ``the period of enrollment for
which the student has been charged'' is the longest period for which the student is charged. The institution must include
any charges assessed the student for that period of enrollment or any portion of that period of enrollment in calculating
the refund. In the example above, since the institution charged for the entire academic year for tuition, the institution
would have to determine the actual total charge for books and supplies for the academic year in order to determine the
refund to the student. If, in the example above, the institution did not charge for books and supplies after the first
academic term, the institution would only include the charges for the first academic term when calculating the refund
for the academic year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also proposes to use the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged, instead of the payment
period concept currently used, to determine the return of refunds and repayments to the Title IV, HEA programs. In
doing away with the concept of a payment period for purposes of the calculation of refunds, the Secretary also proposes
to do away with the practice of attributing Title IV, HEA program assistance when determining the return of refunds
and repayments to the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that the premise for the calculation of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund, (i.e., the refund is to be determined for the percentage of a period of enrollment for which the student has
been charged that remains) dictates that the institution should look at the amount of Title IV, HEA program assistance
received for that same percentage of the period. The Secretary believes that adopting the use of the period of enrollment
for which the student has been charged to determine the return of all refunds and repayments to the Title IV, HEA programs
greatly simplifies these determinations.

Overpayments

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to restructure and revise the current provisions relating to overpayments and the repayments
to Title IV, HEA programs of institutional refunds and overpayments. This preamble addresses those areas of these
current provisions that have been significantly revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No changes are proposed to the procedures by which an institution determines if a student has received an overpayment
for noninstitutional costs.

Repayments to Title IV, HEA Programs of Institutional Refunds and Overpayments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to remove the fraction that is currently used to determine the portion of the refund that an
institution must return to the Title IV, HEA programs. Section 485 of the HEA now specifies the order of return of refunds
to the Title IV, HEA programs. Further, the Technical Amendments of 1993 changed section 485 of the HEA to specify that
an institution is to return a refund to other sources of student assistance only after the refund has been returned
to the Title IV, HEA programs (see the discussion below concerning allocations.) The Secretary proposes to make a
conforming change by removing the fraction currently used to determine the portion of an overpayment that an institution
must return to the Title IV, HEA programs.

The June 8, 1993, final regulations modified the definition of institutional refund to require an institution to
exclude any unpaid charges owed to the institution by a student in determining the amount the institution may retain
for institutional charges. These proposed regulations would retain this provision. However, because the HEA now
specifies that an institution is permitted to subtract any unpaid charges owed by a student from the calculated refund

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund, the requirements of the June 8, 1993, final regulations regarding the treatment of unpaid charges have been
superseded and are inapplicable only in this case. That is, the institution is not required to exclude any unpaid balance
owed to the institution by the student when the institution determines the amount the institution may retain for institutional
charges when calculating a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund under section 484B of the HEA. The Secretary notes that the requirements of &sect;668.22 of the June 8, 1993,
final regulations continue to be in effect for all other refunds calculated in accordance with section 484B of the
HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that if the amount of a refund owed to a student is $25 or less, the institution would not be required
to pay the refund. The Secretary believes that the administrative cost to institutions to make refunds of such a small
amount may be greater than the refunds themselves. This consideration is of particular concern at institutions that
have low tuition charges resulting in small refunds that are administratively burdensome and costly to the institution.

Allocation of Refunds and Overpayments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 485 of the HEA specifies the order of return of refunds to the various sources of aid and to the student. A refund
owed to a student who received funds under any Title IV, HEA program is to be returned to the Title IV, HEA programs from
which the student received aid in the following order until the amounts received by the student from those programs
are eliminated. (1) The FFEL programs; (2) The FDSL Program; (3) The Federal Perkins Loan Program; (4) The Federal
Pell Grant Program; (5) The FSEOG Program; (6) All other sources of aid; (7) The student. The Secretary proposes to
make clear the longstanding policy that, after balances resulting from the FSEOG Program are eliminated, balances
on aid received from all other Title IV, HEA programs must be eliminated before the State and private sources of aid
are refunded. For consistency and to reduce administrative burden, the Secretary proposes to apply this order of
return to repayment of overpayments also except that, in accordance with current regulations, no amount of a repayment
may be allocated to the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, and Federal SLS programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also would make clear that refunds would be returned to eliminate outstanding balances of Title IV,
HEA program aid received for the period of enrollment for which the refunds are made. The Secretary does not believe
that refunds should be used to eliminate, for example, outstanding balances on loans made for prior years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 485 of the HEA does not specify an order of return for refunds under the FFEL programs. The Secretary proposes
a specified order of return for FFEL program funds. Refunds would be returned to eliminate outstanding balances on:
(1) Federal SLS loans; (2) unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans; (3) subsidized Federal Stafford loans; and (4) Federal
PLUS loans, in that order. The Secretary believes that this order is beneficial to the student and that by mandating
the order of return of FFEL program funds, the interest of the student would be protected. The Secretary wishes to clarify
that when returning any FFEL program funds, an institution may return the gross amount of a loan (including the guaranty
and origination fee) if the institution so chooses, to serve as a deterrent to default on the small remaining amount.
This ``extra'' amount would be used to reduce the next source of aid on the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary wishes to clarify that this order must be used if Title IV, HEA program funds are received, whether they
are applied toward institutional charges or disbursed to the student for living expenses. Even if all Title IV, HEA
program funds are disbursed to the student for living expenses, if a refund is owed when the student withdraws from
the institution, the refund must first be returned to the Title IV, HEA programs from which the student received aid
in the order specified.

The Secretary proposes to apply to all the Title IV, HEA programs the definition (with some revisions) of ``withdrawal
date'' that currently applies to the FFEL programs. Only significant revisions are discussed. The definition of
``drop out date'' found in the current &sect;668.22 would be incorporated into this definition. Currently, the FFEL
program regulations define the withdrawal date for a student who has not returned to an institution after the expiration
of an approved leave of absence as the first day of the leave of absence. The Secretary proposes to use, instead, the
last recorded date of class attendance by a student, as documented by the institution. The negotiators reached consensus
that it is fair to define the withdrawal date for a student who failed to return from an approved leave of absence in the
same way as the withdrawal date is defined for a student who drops out, because the student's period of attendance was
only extended on the understanding that he or she would be returning by a specified date. Further, the Secretary proposes
to clarify that a student who returns to an institution after the expiration of a leave of absence during an award year
or, for the FFEL programs, during a period of enrollment in which the student was granted the leave of absence, the student
may not receive additional Title IV, HEA program assistance for coursework that he or she has not completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the FFEL program regulations define the withdrawal date for a student who is enrolled in an educational
program that consists predominantly of correspondence courses as 60 days after the due date of a required lesson that
the student failed to submit in accordance with the established schedule for lessons. The Secretary believes it is
more reasonable to define the withdrawal date in this case as the date of the last submission of a lesson by the student
if the student failed to submit the subsequent lesson in accordance with the established schedule for lessons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add the requirement that a leave of absence may not exceed the length of time between the beginning
of the leave of absence and the institution's next period of enrollment, if the institution's next period of enrollment
after the start of the leave of absence begins more than thirty days after the beginning of the leave of absence due to
a period of nonenrollment (i.e., summer break) that prevents a student from enrolling in any coursework. The Secretary
proposes to add this provision to address graduate programs that do not have summer school sessions, thereby preventing
students from re-enrolling during this time. As the determination of a student's withdrawal date is necessary to
determine when a refund must be paid to a student, the Secretary believes it would be unfair to penalize an institution
for failure to pay timely refunds to a student who is deemed to have ``withdrawn'' only because he or she cannot return
to the institution from a leave of absence because classes are not in session. This provision would not additionally
limit the length of a student's leave of absence which could be up to sixty days or six months under the specified conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that this proposed definition of a leave of absence is a departure from current Federal Pell Grant
Program policy. Currently, for purposes of the Federal Pell Grant Program, a student who is granted a leave of absence
is considered to be no longer enrolled in the institution. The Secretary specifically request comments on the effects
of this proposed change on institutional procedures in relation to the Federal Pell Grant Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require an institution to pay a refund to a student within a specified period of time. The
Secretary believes that 30 days is a sufficient period of time for an institution to complete the administrative procedures
necessary for payment of a refund to a student. This requirement would be in addition to other requirements, which
would not change, for timely payment of refunds to a lender under the FFEL programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes provisions dealing with third-party servicers that were proposed in the NPRM published on
February 17, 1994 (in part II). The Secretary will not repeat the discussion of those provisions here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to extend the requirements of this section to foreign institutions as that term would be defined
in 34 CFR 600.52 of the regulations governing institutional eligibility under the HEA, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6446). Participating institutions, like institutions in the United States, would accordingly
be required to have compliance audits performed, be subject to program reviews and other investigations, and maintain
records under the provisions of this section. The Secretary believes these steps provide the best means for evaluating
a foreign institution's compliance with the requirements for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 487(c) of the HEA requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations as may be necessary to provide for a compliance
audit of an institution with regard to any funds received under the Title IV, HEA programs on at least an annual basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that, currently, the Department of Education could not properly and effectively review the volume
of audits that the Department would receive if every institution submitted an audit report on at least an annual basis.
The Secretary is concerned that an effort that extensive could diminish the resources needed to concentrate on timely
review of those institutions that pose the greatest financial risk to the government and the taxpayer. The Secretary
proposes to exempt from some or all of the audit requirements of this section certain categories of institutions that
pose no serious threat to the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary proposes that an institution,
other than an institution that is participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time, have the audit performed
at least once every two years if it meets the following conditions: (1) The institution received less than $100,000
in total annual funding under the Title IV, HEA programs for the period covered by the audit; or (2) the institution
had no deficiencies identified in the audit report most recently submitted to the Department if that audit report
was submitted in a timely fashion. The Secretary bases this amount on the amount that would exempt entities from the
audit requirements of the Single Audit Act. The Secretary also believes that an institution that had no deficiencies
identified in its most recently submitted audit report will continue to perform at a level that does not warrant as
great a degree of oversight. In addition, an institution would not be required to have a compliance audit for any year
in which the institution receives less than $25,000 in total annual funding under the Title IV, HEA programs. This
proposal would establish in regulations the Secretary's current practice. Institutions that do not handle large
amounts of Title IV, HEA program funds do not put a large amount of Title IV, HEA program funds at risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that in spite of these exemptions the Secretary would reserve the right to require an institution
to have a compliance audit performed annually from any institution as the Secretary deems necessary. Further, the
Secretary proposes to require an institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time to have
an audit performed at least once a year for the first five years of its participation. The Secretary believes it is important
to monitor an institution more closely if the institution has not previously participated in the programs and has
not had an opportunity to establish a record of consistent compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 487(c) of the HEA requires that an audit performed in accordance with this section must cover the period since
the most recent audit. The Secretary proposes to specify, for clarification, that an institution's first audit for
a Title IV, HEA program must cover the institution's activities from the beginning of the institution's participation
in that program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather than continuing to specify deadlines in regulations for the submission of audit reports, the Secretary proposes
to require an institution to submit its audit to the Department's Inspector General by the deadlines established
in the audit guides developed by the Department's Office of Inspector General. Beyond establishing deadlines for
the submission of audit reports, these guides will provide for certain extensions beyond establishing deadlines
for valid reasons. These guides are developed in consultation with the academic community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 487(c) of the HEA requires the Secretary to make the results of compliance audits available to cognizant guaranty
agencies and eligible lenders under the FFEL programs, State agencies, and designated SPREs. The Secretary proposes
to add nationally recognized accrediting agencies to this list, because of the role of accrediting agencies in assisting
the Secretary with regard to institutional participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary proposes to
require institutions to provide copies of their audit reports to these entities upon request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to add a requirement that specifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution must establish and maintain, on a current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, financial and other institutional records necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the institutional eligibility, financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility, and administrative capability of the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes it is essential for the Department to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to this information when evaluating an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the requirements of the provisions governing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability of the institution. Further, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution needs to maintain this information because, under its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreement, the institution must agree to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make the information available to appropriate authorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified there (see the discussion on proposed &sect;668.14). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require that all records required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the applicable Title IV, HEA program regulations be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retained by the institution for at least five years from the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the record is established unless specific program regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that a record be kept for a period of time longer than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five years. Five years is the standard period of time that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions are required to keep most records under the Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that this is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable period of time to require institutions to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most records so that the Department is able to evaluate the past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of an institution.

The Secretary proposes to clarify the purpose of the section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently titled ``Loss of institutional eligibility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution's participation ends under a variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances to reflect statutory changes and to make clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing practice. The Secretary has clarified in these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations the end of participation date currently used by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department to be the date that: The institution closes or stops 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing educational programs (the Secretary proposes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with provisions proposed to be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations governing institutional eligibility under the HEA, to

specify that this closure must be for a reason other than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal vacation period or a natural disaster that directly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affects the institution or the institution's students); the

The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation, as specified under proposed &sect;668.13 governing

certification procedures, expires, or the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisional certification is revoked in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures outlined in that proposed section. This change would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made pursuant to provisions of section 498(g) and (h) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the FFEL programs ends on the date that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has determined that the institution's cohort default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate, for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary has determined the institution's rate, is equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or greater than the threshold rates listed under proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.17(c)(2). This change simply makes the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;668.26 consistent with those of proposed &sect;668.17. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary proposes to specify that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation ends on the date that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives a notice from the appropriate SPRE that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation should be withdrawn. This change is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandated by section 494C(h) of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add to the requirements for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution when the institution's participation in a Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program ends, that the institution shall, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation in the NEISP or SSIG Program ended, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inform immediately the State in which the institution is located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that fact. Further, notwithstanding the requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of Title IV, HEA program funds found in this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution must follow the instructions of that State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the end of that participation. The Secretary also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to add that if the institution's participation in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV, HEA programs end has ended, the institution must

inform the Secretary of how the institution will arrange for the

section that the procedures under this section do not apply in

the case of an institution that fails to qualify for provisional

certification because the institution does not meet the factors

assistance (specifically, Federal Pell Grant Program funds) that

an institution has provided to its students in accordance with

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for submission of reports, if an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has provided Federal Pell Grants in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Pell Grant Program regulations, but has not received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit or payment for those grants, the institution may receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment or a reduction in accountability for those grants. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would have to demonstrate that it qualifies for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit or payment by means of a finding contained in an audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report as initially submitted to the Department that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted after December 31, 1988. The audit would have to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been timely submitted in accordance with 34 CFR 668.23(c), with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to grants made during the period of that audit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary specifies that, in determining whether the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifies for a payment or reduction in accountability, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would take into account any liabilities of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution arising from that audit or any other source. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary collects those liabilities by offset in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34 CFR part 30.

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are those resulting from statutory requirements and those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with information collection requirements, if any, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heading 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments in the exercise of their governmental function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient administration of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of small entities. The small entities affected by these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations are small institutions of postsecondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education. These regulations make modifications that reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs. These changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds.

668.17, 668.22, 668.23, 668.26, 690.83 and Appendix A contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information collection requirements. As required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM contains provisions that would affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postsecondary institutions who wish to participate in the Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV student financial assistance programs. Annual public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and recordkeeping burden contained in the collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information proposed in these regulations is estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10,488 hours, including the time for searching existing data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, completing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reviewing the collection of information, and submitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on

Secretary's recognition of that agency according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered by the Secretary; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is not financially responsible under &sect;668.15(c)(2), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been determined not to be financially responsible under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.15 at any time during the five-year period preceding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's decision to certify the institution provisionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The institution, or one or more persons or entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit to the Secretary financial guarantees in an amount

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Revocation of provisional certification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the expiration of a provisionally certified institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of participation in a Title IV, HEA program, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that the institution is unable to meet its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities under its program participation agreement, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary may revoke the institution's provisional certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for participation in that program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) If the Secretary revokes the provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification of an institution under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, the Secretary sends the institution a notice by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registered mail, return receipt requested. The Secretary also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may transmit the notice by other, more expeditious means, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The revocation takes effect on the date that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary mails the notice to the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The notice states the basis for the revocation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of the revocation to the institution, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may request the Secretary to reconsider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revocation. The consequences of a revocation are described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) An institution may request reconsideration of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revocation under this section by submitting to the Secretary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 20 days of the institution's receipt of the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice, written evidence that the revocation is unwarranted. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must file the request with the Secretary by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand-delivery, mail, or facsimile transmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The filing date of the request is the date on which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the request is_

(B) Mailed; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Sent by facsimile transmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Documents filed by facsimile transmission must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmitted to the Secretary in accordance with instructions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the Secretary in the notice of revocation. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution filing by facsimile transmission is responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirming that a complete and legible copy of the document was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The Secretary discourages the use of facsimile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmission for documents longer than five pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4)(i) The Secretary promptly considers an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for reconsideration of a revocation and notifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, by registered mail, return receipt requested, of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's final decision. The Secretary also may transmit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice by other, more expeditious means, if practical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the Secretary determines that the revocation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted, the Secretary's notice informs the institution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution may apply for reinstatement of participation only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the later of the expiration of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Eighteen months after the effective date of the revocation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A debarment or suspension of the institution under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12549 or the Federal Acquisition Regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the Secretary determines that the revocation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's provisional certification is unwarranted, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's notice informs the institution that the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisional certification is reinstated, effective on the date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Secretary's original revocation notice was mailed, for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5)(i) The mailing date of a notice of revocation or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for reconsideration of a revocation is the date evidenced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the original receipt of mailing from the U.S. Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The date on which a request for reconsideration of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revocation is submitted is_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the request was sent by a delivery service other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the U.S. Postal Service, the date evidenced on the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt by that service; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the request was sent by facsimile transmission, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date that the document is recorded as received by facsimile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment that receives the transmission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

program participation agreement conditions the initial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued participation of an eligible institution in any Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program upon compliance with the provisions of this part, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the individual program regulations, and any additional conditions

(1) It will comply with any statutory provision of or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to Title IV of the HEA, any regulatory provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed under that statutory authority, or any applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special arrangement, agreement, or limitation, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that the institution will use funds it receives under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any Title IV, HEA program and any interest or other earnings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereon, solely for the purposes specified in and in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with that program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As a fiduciary responsible for administering Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds, if the institution is permitted to request funds under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program advance payment method, the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will time its requests for funds under the program to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's immediate Title IV, HEA program needs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) It will not request from or charge any student a fee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for processing or handling any application, form, or data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to determine a student's eligibility for, and amount of, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program assistance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) It will establish and maintain such administrative and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal procedures and records as may be necessary to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper and efficient administration of funds received from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary or from students under the Title IV, HEA programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together with assurances that the institution will provide, upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request and in a timely manner, information relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability and financial responsibility of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal PLUS, and Federal SLS programs for attendance at the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year for repayment of refunds. The cash reserve must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained in a cash reserve account, consisting of cash or cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalents as defined in accordance with generally accepted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principles; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Has not had, as part of the audit report for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's most recently completed fiscal year_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A statement by the accountant acknowledging substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doubt about the institution's ability to continue operation as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
going concern; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A finding of unauthorized use of donor restricted net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets to meet current operating expenses; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A disclaimed or adverse opinion by the accountant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) For a for-profit institution_(i) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, a ratio of current assets to
current liabilities of at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.25:1. For purposes of this section, the calculation of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio must exclude uncollateralized loans receivable from owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and related parties. Should application of paragraph (b)(5) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section cause a portion of the institution's cash reserves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be classified as a restricted asset, those cash reserves may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be included in current assets in calculating the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current ratio; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Has not had operating losses over both of its two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latest fiscal years that causes an operating loss exceeding 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the institution's previous year's tangible net worth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for its latest fiscal year. For purposes of this subsection, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating loss will be calculated by subtracting from total net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income: extraordinary gains or losses; income or losses from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discontinued operations; prior period adjustments; and, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, estimate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting entity. The calculation of tangible net worth must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclude all assets defined as intangible in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally accepted accounting principles; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Had, for its latest fiscal year, a positive tangible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net worth. For purposes of this section, a positive tangible net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worth occurs if the institution's tangible assets exceed its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities. The calculation of tangible net worth must exclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all assets defined as intangible in accordance with generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted accounting principles. In applying this standard, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary may consider the effect of extraordinary gains or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses resulting from unusual and infrequent events, and may take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into consideration the cumulative effect of changes in accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principle, estimate or reporting entity to the extent that such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change results in a more accurate representation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial position in accordance with generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted accounting principles; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) For a nonprofit institution_(i) Prepares a classified statement of financial position in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles or provides the required information as footnotes to the audit; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1:1; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Has not had, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease in total net assets of such significance that, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued, would result in a ratio of current assets to current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities of less than 1:1. The Secretary may consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of extraordinary gains or losses resulting from unusual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and infrequent events, and may take into consideration the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, estimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or reporting entity to the extent that such a change results in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more accurate representation of the institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles. For purposes of this analysis, the Secretary may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments that have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported as changes in unrestricted net assets; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) For a public institution, has its liabilities backed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the full faith and credit of a State, or by an equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governmental entity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is located in, and is legally authorized to operate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within, a State that has a tuition recovery fund that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable to the Secretary and ensures that the institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to pay all required refunds; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

responsible under this section by evaluating documents submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the institution and information obtained from other sources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including outside sources of credit information. To enable the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to make this determination, the institution shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit to the Secretary for its two latest complete fiscal years, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a set of financial statements of the institution, prepared in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to that institution as established by the American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, audited by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent certified public accountant in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such tests of the institution's accounting records and such other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
auditing procedures that the independent auditor considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary in the circumstances. The Secretary may also require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution to submit or otherwise make available the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountant's work papers. If an institution submits audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidated financial statements of its parent corporation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to use in determining the institution's level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility, the consolidated financial statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be supplemented with consolidating schedules showing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidation of each of the parent corporation's subsidiaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(each separate institution participating in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs must be shown separately), intercompany eliminating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entries, and derived consolidated totals. The Secretary may also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the institution to submit additional substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An institution shall submit the documents required in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (e)(1) of this section annually within four months 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the end of the institution's fiscal year, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requests a more frequent submission. Upon a showing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
good cause, the Secretary may grant a filing extension to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To begin and to continue to participate in any Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, an institution shall demonstrate to the Secretary that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution is capable of adequately administering that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program under each of the standards established in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary considers an institution to have that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability if the institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Administers the Title IV, HEA programs in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any statutory provisions of or applicable to Title IV of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA, any regulatory provisions prescribed under that statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) Designates a capable individual to be responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for administering all the Title IV, HEA programs in which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participates and for coordinating those programs with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's other Federal and non-Federal programs of student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial assistance. The Secretary considers an individual to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be ``capable'' under this paragraph if the individual is certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the State in which the institution is located, if the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires certification of financial aid administrators. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary may consider other factors in determining whether an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual is capable, including, but not limited to, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual's successful completion of Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training provided or approved by the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Uses an adequate number of qualified persons to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administer the Title IV, HEA programs in which the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participates. The Secretary considers the following factors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether an institution uses an adequate number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified persons_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The number and types of programs in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution participates; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The number of applications evaluated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The number of students who receive any student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial assistance at the institution and the amount of funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The financial aid delivery system used by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The degree of office automation used by the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Communicates to the individual designated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for administering Title IV, HEA programs, all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information received by any institutional office that bears on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's eligibility for Title IV, HEA program assistance; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Has written procedures for or written information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The nature and frequency of communication of pertinent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information among all the offices that have an impact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. Examples of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information may include information on a student's admissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status, enrollment status, attendance (if applicable), prior or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrent attendance at another postsecondary institution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory academic progress, and payment or disbursement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) The responsibilities of the various offices with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the approval, disbursement, and delivery of Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program assistance and the preparation and submission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports to the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1) Administers Title IV, HEA programs with adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checks and balances in its system of internal controls; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Divides the functions of authorizing payments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbursing or delivering funds so that no office has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for both functions with respect to any particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student aided under the programs. For example, the functions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorizing payments and disbursing or delivering funds must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided so that for any particular student aided under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, the two functions are carried out by at least two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizationally independent individuals who are not members of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same family, as defined in &sect;668.15, or who do not together 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise substantial control, as defined in &sect;668.15, over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for measuring whether an otherwise eligible student is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintaining satisfactory progress in his or her educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. The Secretary considers an institution's standards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be reasonable if the standards_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Conform with the standards of satisfactory progress of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nationally recognized accrediting agency that accredits or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preaccredits the institution, if the institution is accredited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or preaccredited, and if the agency has those standards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For a student enrolled in an eligible program who is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive assistance under a Title IV, HEA program, are the same as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or stricter than the institution's standards for a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled in the same educational program who is not receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance under a Title IV, HEA program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Include the following elements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Grades, work projects completed, or comparable factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are measurable against a norm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A maximum time frame in which a student must complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her educational program. The time frame must be_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Based on the student's enrollment status; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For an undergraduate program, no longer than 150 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the published length of the educational program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Divided into increments, not to exceed the lesser of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one academic year or one-half the published length of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A schedule established by the institution designating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the minimum percentage or amount of work that a student must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successfully complete at the end of each increment to complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her educational program within the maximum time frame. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A determination at the end of each increment by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution whether the student has successfully completed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate percentage or amount of work according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Consistent application of standards to all students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within categories of students, e.g., full-time, part-time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undergraduate, and graduate students, and educational programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Specific policies defining the effect of course 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incompletes, withdrawals, repetitions, and noncredit remedial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
courses on satisfactory progress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Specific procedures under which a student may appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a determination that the student is not making satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Specific procedures for reinstatement of aid; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Meet or exceed the requirements of &sect;668.7(c); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Develops and applies an adequate system to identify and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolve discrepancies in the information that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives from different sources with respect to a student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for financial aid under Title IV, HEA programs. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether the institution's system is adequate, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary considers whether the institution obtains and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviews_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All student aid applications, need analysis documents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statements of Educational Purpose, Statements of Registration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Status, and eligibility notification documents presented by or on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf of each applicant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any documents, including any copies of State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal income tax returns, that are normally collected by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to verify information received from the student or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other sources; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any other information normally available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution regarding a student's citizenship, previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational experience, or other factors relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's eligibility for funds under the Title IV, HEA programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Refers to the Office of Inspector General of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Education for investigation_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) After conducting the review of an application provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for under paragraph (f) of this section, any information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating that an applicant for Title IV, HEA program assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with his or her application. The type of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution must refer is that which is relevant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility of the applicant for Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance, or the amount of the assistance. Examples of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of information are_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) False claims of independent student status; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) False claims of citizenship; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) Any information indicating that any employee, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs, or the receipt of funds under those programs, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have engaged in fraud, misrepresentation, conversion or breach of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiduciary responsibility, or other illegal conduct involving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs. The type of information that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must refer is that which is relevant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility and funding of the institution and its students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the Title IV, HEA programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Provides adequate financial aid counseling to eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who apply for Title IV, HEA program assistance. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether an institution provides adequate counseling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary considers whether its counseling includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information regarding_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The source and amount of each type of aid offered; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The method by which aid is determined and disbursed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivered, or applied to a student's account; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The rights and responsibilities of the student with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to enrollment at the institution and receipt of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid. This information includes the institution's refund policy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its standards of satisfactory progress, and other conditions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may alter the student's aid package;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Has and implements a plan, designed by the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the student population served by the institution, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates that for an institution that enrolls a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of students with special support service needs (including, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not limited to, child care and transportation), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has provided these students with information about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how to access to appropriate support services that will foster 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the students' opportunity to complete the educational program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Has procedures for receiving, investigating, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolving student complaints; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution are to prepare a student for gainful employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a recognized occupation_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Demonstrates a reasonable relationship between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length of the program and entry level requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized occupation for which the program prepares the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary considers the relationship to be reasonable if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of clock hours provided in the program does not exceed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than 50 percent the minimum number of clock hours required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for training in the recognized occupation for which the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares the student, as established by the State in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Establishes the need for the training for the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) The relationship of mandatory and elective course 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components of occupational, professional, and vocational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational programs to specific licensure standards of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which the institution is located in specific occupations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Has advertising, promotion, and student recruitment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices that accurately reflect the content and objectives of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the educational programs offered by the institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) Has provided all program and fiscal reports and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements required for compliance with the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Default rates.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the Federal Stafford loan and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal SLS cohort default rate for an institution exceeds 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent for any fiscal year, the Secretary notifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution of that rate and may, after consultation as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary deems appropriate with cognizant guaranty agencies take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one or more of the following actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Initiate a proceeding under Subpart G of this part to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Title IV, HEA programs, if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The institution's Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989 and has not been reduced by an increment of at least 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent from its rate for the previous fiscal year (e.g., a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50-percent rate was not reduced to 45 percent or below); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The institution's Federal Stafford loan and Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SLS cohort default rate exceeds_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 60 percent for fiscal year 1989; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 55 percent for fiscal year 1990; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 50 percent for fiscal year 1991; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 45 percent for fiscal year 1992; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) 40 percent for any fiscal year after fiscal year 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To help the Secretary make a preliminary determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as to the appropriate action to be taken by the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the institution, require the institution to submit to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary and one or more guaranty agencies, as defined in 34 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 682, any information relating to that determination, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably required by the Secretary, within a time frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Default management plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the Federal Stafford loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Federal SLS cohort default rate for an institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is greater than 20 percent but less than or equal to 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, the institution must submit a default management plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that implements the measures described in appendix D of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part. An institution that wishes to submit a default management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan that deviates from the measures described in appendix D of this part must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a justification for the deviation that includes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rationale explaining why the measures from which the plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviates are not appropriate for the institution's specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation. The institution must implement the default management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan upon notification from the Secretary that the plan has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year, the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must implement all of the default management reduction measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in appendix D of this part no later than 60 days after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution receives the Secretary's notification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's cohort default rate. An institution is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to submit any written plans to the Secretary or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency unless the Secretary or guaranty agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically requests the institution to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
End of participation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Except as provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(6) of this section, an institution's participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the FFEL programs ends if the Secretary determines that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's cohort default rate, for each of the three most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has determined the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's rate, is equal to or greater than the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of the determinations made under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the threshold rates are_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 35 percent for each of fiscal years 1991 and 1992; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 30 percent for fiscal year 1993; and

with the date that the institution receives notification from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and continuing_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For the remainder of the fiscal year in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary determines that the institution's participation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ended under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For the two subsequent fiscal years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) An institution whose participation in the FFEL programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ends under paragraph (c)(1) of this section may not participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the FFEL programs until the institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Receives notification from the Secretary that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice ending the institution's participation is withdrawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) of this section; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Following the period described in paragraph (c)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, satisfies the Secretary that the institution meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all requirements for participation in the FFEL programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
executes a new agreement with the Secretary for participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FFEL programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the Secretary withdraws the notification of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's loss of participation pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section, the participation of the institution is restored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective as of the date that the institution received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary of the loss of participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Until July 1, 1994, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section do not apply to a historically black college or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
university within the meaning of section 322(2) of the HEA, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribally controlled community college within the meaning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 2(a)(4) of the Tribally Controlled Community College 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assistance Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 1801(a)(4)), or a Navajo community college under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Navajo Community College Act (25 U.S.C. 640a&hyph;640c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7)(i) If the Secretary's designated department official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives written notice from an institution whose participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ends under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, within seven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar days from the date on which the institution receives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, that the institution intends to appeal the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation under paragraph (d) of this section, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may, notwithstanding &sect;668.26(d) continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the FFEL programs until no later than the 30th 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar day following the date on which the institution receives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If an institution satisfies the conditions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section for participating in the

FFEL programs until the 30th calendar day following the date on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the institution receives notification from the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the institution may, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notwithstanding &sect;668.26(d), continue to participate in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs after that date, until the Secretary issues a decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the institution's appeal, if the institution, by the 30th 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar day following the date on which the institution receives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, files an appeal that is complete in all respects in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal of an institution relying on paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section is not considered incomplete by virtue of a guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's not having yet complied with_or having failed to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with_34 CFR 682.401(b)(14), which requires the agency to respond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an institution's request for verification of data within 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working days, if the institution submitted that request within 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working days from the date on which the institution received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, and the institution simultaneously submitted a copy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that request to the Secretary's designated Department official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the institution receives the guaranty agency's response, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete its appeal, the institution must submit the verified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data to the Secretary's designated Department official within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five working days in order to continue participating in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs until the Secretary issues a decision on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's appeal.

Appeal procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An institution may appeal the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of participation in the FFEL programs under paragraph (c)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section by submitting an appeal in writing to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's designated Department official that is postmarked no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later than 30 days after it receives notification of its loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation. The institution may appeal on the grounds that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i)(A) The calculation of the institution's cohort default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for any of the three fiscal years relevant to the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation is not accurate; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A recalculation with corrected data verified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cognizant guaranty agency or agencies would produce a cohort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default rate for any of those fiscal years that is below the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold percentage specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this

(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Fifteen percent or fewer of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Stafford or Federal SLS loans for any twenty-four month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period ending not more than six months prior to the date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution submits its appeal; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) For any twenty-four month period ending not more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-thirds or more of the institution's students who are enrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on at least a half-time basis are individuals from disadvantaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic backgrounds, as established by documentary evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by the institution. Such evidence must relate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualification by those students for an Expected Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contribution (EFC) (formerly institutions were required to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Pell Grant index), as defined in 34 CFR 690.2, of zero for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicable award year or attribution to those students of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted gross income of the student and his or her parents or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spouse, if applicable, reported for the applicable award year of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than the poverty level, as determined under criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the Department of Health and Human Services; and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Two-thirds or more of the institution's students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were enrolled on a full-time basis in any twenty-four month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period ending not more than six months prior to the date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution submits its appeal completed the educational programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which they were enrolled. This rate is calculated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparing the number of students who were classified as full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at their initial enrollment in the institution, and were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their programs within the relevant twenty-four month period, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of these students who received a degree, certificate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other recognized educational credential from the institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred from the institution to a higher level educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program at another institution for which the prior program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided substantial preparation; or, at the end of the twenty-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four month period, remained enrolled and were making satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic progress toward completion of their educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The calculation does not include students who did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete their programs because they left the institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve in the armed forces; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The institution had a placement rate of two-thirds or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more with respect to its former students who received a degree, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate, or other recognized educational credential from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution in any twenty-four month period ending not more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rate is calculated by determining the percentage of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those students who, based on evidence submitted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, are on that date employed, or had been employed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 13 weeks following receipt of the credential from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, in the occupation for which the institution provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, or are enrolled or had been enrolled for at least 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a higher level educational program at another institution for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the prior educational program provided substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, a student is originally scheduled, at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment, to complete the educational program on the date when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student will have been enrolled in the program for the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time normally required to complete the program. The ``amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time normally required to complete the program'' is the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time student, or the period of time between the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment and the anticipated graduation date appearing on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's loan application, if any, whichever is less.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) In determining the number of students who default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the end of that following fiscal year, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes only loans for which the Secretary or a guaranty agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has paid claims for insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) (A) In the case of a student who has attended and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowed at more than one institution, the student (and his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution for attendance at which the student received a loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that entered repayment in the fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other affiliated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entity or individual, in order to avoid default by the borrower, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is considered as in default for purposes of this definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Any loan that has been rehabilitated under section 428F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the HEA before the end of that following fiscal year is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered as in default for purposes of this definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) For the purposes of this definition, a loan made in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with section 428A of the HEA (or a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consolidation Loan a portion of which is used to repay a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SLS loan) shall not be considered to enter repayment until after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower has ceased to be enrolled in an educational program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credential at the participating institution on at least a half-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time basis (as determined by the institution) and ceased to be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a period of forbearance based on such enrollment. Each eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lender of a loan made under section 428A (or a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consolidation Loan a portion of which is used to repay a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SLS loan) of the HEA shall provide the guaranty agency with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information necessary to determine when the loan entered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency shall provide that information to the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) (A) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first day of the fiscal year for which the rate is calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations of the institution from the date the institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notified of that rate until the institution is notified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary that the rate no longer applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) (A) For an institution that changes its status from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that of a location of one institution to that of a free-standing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the institution's status as of October 1 of the fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year for which a cohort default rate is being calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For an institution that changes its status from that of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a free-standing institution to that of a location of another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the combined number of students who enter repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the applicable fiscal year and the combined number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who default during the applicable fiscal years from both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the former free-standing institution and the other institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This cohort default rate applies to the new, consolidated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution and all of its current locations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) For free-standing institutions that merge to form a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new, consolidated institution, the Secretary determines the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter repayment during the applicable fiscal year and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined number of students who default during the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal years from all of the institutions that are merging. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate applies to the new consolidated institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) For a location of one institution that becomes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location of another institution, the Secretary determines the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter repayment during the applicable fiscal year and the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of students who default during the applicable fiscal years from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both of the institutions in their entirety, not limited solely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the respective locations.

Federal SLS Program participation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loses its participation in the Federal SLS Program if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary determines that the institution's cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the most recent fiscal year for which that rate is available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is equal to or greater than 30 percent. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's loss of participation does not apply to a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who is not an undergraduate student or who has received a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SLS loan previously for enrollment in the same educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program at the institution (except that previous receipt of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal SLS loan shall not qualify a student for a Federal SLS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan with respect to an extension of the duration of that

students are made aware of the new policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The institution shall publish the costs of required

Pro rata refund, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, means a refund by an institution to a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attending that institution for the first time of not less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that portion of the tuition, fees, room, board, and other charges

(i) (A) Any unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A scheduled cash payment is the amount of institutional charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is not paid for by financial aid for the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment for which the student has been charged exclusive of_

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Any amount scheduled to be paid by Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program assistance that the student has been awarded that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable to the student even though the student has withdrawn; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stafford Loan, Federal SLS, and Federal PLUS programs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with 34 CFR 682.207(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computed by subtracting the amount paid by the student for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the scheduled cash payment for the period of enrollment for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student has been charged; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A reasonable administrative fee not to exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lesser of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(iii) Any application fee charged by the institution; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The portion of ``board'' charges (i.e., meal tickets) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that have been expended by the student that exceed the portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to the period for which the student attended at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of withdrawal. The institution must include in the refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any unexpended ``board'' credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (i) For purposes of this section, ``other charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed the student by the institution'' include, but are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to, charges for any equipment (including books and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies) issued by an institution to the student. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may deduct from the refund owed under this paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the documented cost to the institution of equipment issued to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student if the institution specifies in the enrollment agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a separate charge for equipment which the student actually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtains or if the institution refers the student to a vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated by an affiliated or related entity and the student does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not return the equipment in good condition, allowing for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days following the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student's withdrawal. The student shall be liable for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned in good condition exceeds the refund under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph. Equipment is not considered to be returned in good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition if the equipment cannot be reused because of clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized health and sanitary reasons, and this fact is clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conspicuously disclosed in the enrollment agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An institution may not delay its payment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of a refund allocable under this section to a Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program or a lender under 34 CFR 682.607 by reason of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process for return of equipment prescribed in paragraph (c)(4)(i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For purposes of this section_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) ``Room'' charges do not include charges that are passed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the institution from an entity that is not under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of, related to, or affiliated with the institution; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) ``Other charges assessed the student by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution'' do not include fees for group health insurance, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this insurance is required for all students and the purchased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage remains in effect for the student throughout the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the student was charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) (i) For purposes of this section, a student attending an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution for the first time is a student who_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Has not previously attended at least one class at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Received a refund of 100 percent of his or her tuition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fees (less any permitted administrative fee) under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's refund policy for previous attendance at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A student remains a first-time student until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student either_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Withdraws, drops out, or is expelled from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution after attending at least one class; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(5) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, ``the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been charged that remains'' is determined_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in credit hours, by dividing the total number of weeks comprising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the number of weeks remaining in that period as of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's withdrawal date; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in clock hours, by dividing the total number of clock hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprising the period of enrollment for which the student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been charged into the number of scheduled clock hours remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be completed by the student in that period as of the student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal date; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In the case of an educational program that consists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predominantly of correspondence courses, by dividing the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of lessons comprising the period of enrollment for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student has been charged into the number of lessons not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Period of enrollment for which the student has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For purposes of this section, ``the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment for which the student has been charged,'' means the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual period for which an institution charges a student, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the minimum period must be_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in credit hours and uses semesters, trimesters, quarters, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other academic terms, the semester, trimester, quarter or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic term; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in credit hours and does not use semesters, trimesters, quarters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other academic terms, or an educational program that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured in clock hours, the lesser of the length of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program or an academic year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If an institution charges by different periods for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different charges, the ``period of enrollment for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student has been charged'' for purposes of this section is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longest period for which the student is charged. The institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must include any charges assessed the student for the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment or any portion of that period of enrollment when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating the refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

whether a student has received an overpayment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noninstitutional costs for the period of enrollment for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student has been charged if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The student officially withdraws, drops out, or is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expelled on or after his or her first day of class of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The student received Title IV, HEA program assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than from the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal SLS Program for that period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (i) To determine if the student owes an overpayment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution shall subtract the noninstitutional costs that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student incurred for that portion of the period of enrollment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the student has been charged from the amount of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance (other than from the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS Program) that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbursed to the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Noninstitutional costs may include, but are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to, room and board for which the student does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract with the institution, books, supplies, transportation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and miscellaneous expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Repayments to Title IV, HEA programs of institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunds and overpayments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1)(i) An institution shall return a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the refund calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section to the Title IV, HEA programs if the student to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whom the refund is owed received assistance under any Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program other than the FWS Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The portion of the refund that an institution shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return to the Title IV, HEA programs may not exceed the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance that the student received under the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs other than under the FWS Program for the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1)(iii) of this section_

(i) An institutional refund means the amount paid for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional charges for the period of enrollment for which the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may retain under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been charged that the student was actually enrolled at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An institution may not include any unpaid amount of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled cash payment in determining the amount that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may retain for institutional charges. A scheduled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cash payment is the amount of institutional charges that has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been paid by financial aid for the period of enrollment for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student has been charged, exclusive of_

Stafford, Federal SLS, and Federal PLUS programs in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(iii) In determining the amount that the institution may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retain for the portion of the period of enrollment for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student has been charged during which the student was actually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled, an institution shall_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Compute the unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by subtracting the amount paid by the student for that period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment for which the student has been charged from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled cash payment for the period of enrollment for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equal to the amount that may be retained by the institution under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's refund policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) A student must repay to the institution or to the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the amount of the overpayment is less than $100, the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Except as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in paragraphs (i)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's withdrawal date is the earlier of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The date that the student notifies an institution of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the expiration of a leave of absence approved under paragraph

submitted by the student, if the student failed to submit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent lesson in accordance with the schedule for lessons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the institution. However, if the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes in writing, within 60 days of the date of the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lesson that he or she submitted, a desire to continue in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

submitted on time, the institution may restore that student to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``in school'' status for purposes of funds received under the Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA programs. The institution may not grant the student more

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment after the start of the leave of absence begins more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than thirty days after the beginning of the leave of absence, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a corresponding period of nonenrollment (i.e., summer break) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevents a student from enrolling in any coursework.

16. A new Appendix A to Part 668 is added to read as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix A to Part 668_Standards for Acceptable Refund Policies by
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Participating Institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of &sect;668.22(b)(1)(iv)(A), the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers an institution to have a fair and equitable refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy if the institution uses a policy that meets the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this appendix. These requirements are a modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
version of guidelines developed by the National Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
College and University Business Officers. These requirements do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not affect an institution's obligation to comply with other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Education regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The governing board of the institution must review and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve the schedule of all institutional charges and refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies applicable to students. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The pricing of services and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund policies have important consequences to students, parents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution, and society; as such, pricing and refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies must receive board attention and approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(II) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must seek consumer views in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of establishing and amending charge and refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Decisions regarding institutional funds are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultimately the sole responsibility of the institution's legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated fund custodians. However, consumer concerns do affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision making, and involving consumers in decision making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to charges and refunds is an essential approach for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing student needs and creating public awareness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(III) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must publish a current schedule of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all student charges (including the costs of required supplies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment), publish a statement of the purpose for such charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and related refund policies, have those statements readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available free of charge to current and prospective students, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantiate that the costs of required supplies and equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are reasonably related to the cost of providing the supplies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment to the students. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Students and parents have a right to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
know what charges they will be expected to pay and what will or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be refunded. They also have a right to know what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services accompany payment of the charges. Informational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials published free for students and prospective students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are ideal for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(IV) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must clearly designate all optional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges as ``optional'' in all published schedules and related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Charges that are mandatory and charges that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optional must be plainly differentiated in all printed materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statements accompanying the schedule may include institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endorsements of the optional program or service. The institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must state clearly in its schedule if a charge is optional for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some students but required for others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(V) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must clearly identify charges and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits that are nonrefundable as ``nonrefundable'' on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published schedules. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions determine on an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis which of their charges are refundable or nonrefundable. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, admission fees, application fees, laboratory fees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility and student activity fees, and other similar charges are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not refundable. These fees are generally charged to cover the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of activities such as processing applications and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student information, reserving academic positions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing the limits of institutional programs and services, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserving housing space, and otherwise setting the fixed costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution for the coming academic periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions determine on an individual basis which of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits are refundable or nonrefundable. Some deposits will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonrefundable or will be credited to a student's account (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition deposits). Others are refundable according to the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the deposit agreement (e.g., deposits for breakage). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VI) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must refund housing rental charges, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less a deposit, as long as written notification of cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is made prior to a well-publicized date that provides reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to make the space available to other students.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written notification on or before the beginning of the term of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contract is necessary to ensure utilization of housing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the term of the contract, room charges are generally not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refundable. However, based on the program offered, space 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability, debt service requirements, State and local laws, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other individual circumstances, institutions may provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some more flexible refund guideline for housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VII) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must refund board charges in full, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less a deposit, if written notification of cancellation is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to a well-publicized date that falls on or before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning of the term of the contract. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequent board charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be refunded on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
basis. It is reasonable to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a refund for those goods and services not consumed. The deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should reflect that portion of an institution's costs that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixed for the term of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VIII) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institutional refund policy must include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following requirements: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The institution must refund 100 percent of the tuition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges, less an administrative fee that does not exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lesser of $100 or 5 percent of the tuition, if the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submits written notice of cancellation on or before one week 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preceding the first day of classes for the period of enrollment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the student was charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The institution must refund at least 90 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation between the end of the period of time specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VIII) A. and the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of enrollment for which the student was charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The institution must refund at least 50 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation between the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of that period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. The institution must refund at least 25 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation between the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of the first 50 percent (in time) of the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. The institution may deduct from the refund owed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this paragraph the documented cost to the institution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment issued to the student if the institution specifies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the enrollment agreement a separate charge for equipment that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student actually obtains or if the institution refers the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a vendor operated by an affiliated or related entity and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student does not return the equipment in good condition, allowing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days following the date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the student's withdrawal. The student shall be liable for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the refund under this paragraph. Equipment is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be returned in good condition if the equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be reused because of clearly recognized health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitary reasons, and this fact is clearly and conspicuously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosed in the enrollment agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(IX) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must assess no penalty charges where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution, as opposed to the student, is in error. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges, such as those involving late registration fees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change-of-schedule fees, and late payment fees, must not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed if it is determined that the student is not responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the action causing the charges to be levied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(X) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must advise students that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifications of withdrawal or cancellation and requests for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund must be in writing and addressed to the designated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution officer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A student's written notification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal or cancellation and request for a refund provides an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate record of transactions and also ensures that the request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be processed on a timely basis. Acceptance of oral requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is an undesirable practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(XI) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must pay or credit refunds due in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with &sect;668.22(h)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(XII) The institution must publicize, as a part of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dissemination of information on charges and refunds, that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeals process exists for students or parents who believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual circumstances warrant exceptions from published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy. The informational materials must include the name, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title, and address of the official responsible for handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Although charges and refund policies should reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive consideration of student and institutional needs, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be possible to encompass in these structures the variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of personal circumstances that may exist or develop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions are required to provide a system of due process to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their students, and charges and refund policies are legitimately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a part of that process. Students and parents should be informed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regularly of procedures for requesting information concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions to published policies.

or (d) of this section, if an institution demonstrates to the

satisfaction of the Secretary that the institution has provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Pell Grants in accordance with this part but has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received credit or payment for those grants, the institution may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The institution must demonstrate that it qualifies for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a credit or payment by means of a finding contained in an audit

(3) In determining whether the institution qualifies for a

account any liabilities of the institution arising from that

I. Academic Year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Section 481(d)(2) of the HEA provides that an ``academic year'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must require a minimum of 30 weeks of instruction time in which a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student is expected to complete at least 24 semester or trimester 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours or 36 quarter hours at an institution that measures program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length in credit hours or at least 900 clock hours at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that measures program length in clock hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should prorations be calculated? For example, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22 weeks are offered, how does an institution determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of an academic year that applies? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Prorations of an academic year in educational programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shorter than an academic year should be based solely on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of credit or clock hours provided, without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard to the number of weeks required. Proration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be used for educational programs of one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic year or longer. Attempts to prorate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length of an academic year using both weeks and credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or clock hours would be inconsistent and confusing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because credit or clock hours are not always evenly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed over the calendar length of an educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Prorations should be based on the minimum number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock or credit hours that a full-time student in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible program is scheduled to take in an academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. Prorations should not be based on the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks in the academic year. A minority opposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion of a reference to ``eligible program'' in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What is a week? How should portions of a week be treated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A week should include any week during a portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the educational process takes place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A majority of participants recommended that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructional week be defined in terms of a fixed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of clock hours of instruction. Thus, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, if regulations define an instructional week as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the completion of 30 clock hours, a student who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completes 90 clock hours of instruction in two calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks should be considered to have completed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent of three instructional weeks. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A week should be defined as a seven-day period that can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begin on any day of the week. The seven-day periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue for 30 periods of time. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A ``week'' should be defined as either each seven-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period within an enrollment period; or each seven-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period (within an enrollment period) during which any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruction occurred. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What is instructional time? Should periods provided for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orientation, testing, and vacation count? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Instructional time should be measured on the basis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar weeks that begin on Monday and end on Sunday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instructional time should consist of a period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous enrollment beginning with the first week of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classes and ending with the conclusion of the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment, including any normally scheduled breaks in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the academic calendar. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Instructional time should include time spent reading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and taking examinations. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The interests of students, institutions, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents need to be considered in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructional time. Some participants recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the determination be left to accrediting agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other participants recommended that the determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be left to the Secretary. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What consideration should be given to programs with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condensed class schedules, or to weekend programs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Because instructional time should be measured on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of periods of continuous enrollment, special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration for condensed schedules or weekend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs is unnecessary. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The interests of students, institutions, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents need to be considered in determining how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to treat condensed schedules and weekend programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some participants recommended that the determination be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
left to accrediting agencies. Other participants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the determination be left to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Condensed programs that include the equivalent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workload of a regular academic-year program should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to meet the definition of academic year.

5. How does the new definition affect less-than-full-time students? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The definition does not affect part-time students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A student who completes fewer than the required minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of clock or credit hours during the 30-week 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period should be considered less-than-full-time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The length of the academic year is irrelevant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the enrollment status of students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enrollment status is determined by the length of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(in terms of credit or clock hours) that a student

takes to complete a ``program.'' [Atlanta]

II. Eligible Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Effective July 1, 1993, section 481(b) and (c) of the HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a proprietary institution of higher education or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postsecondary vocational institution to provide an eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program of training that prepares students for gainful employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a recognized occupation. Section 481(e) of the HEA requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an eligible program to consist of at least 600 clock hours, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16 semester hours, or 24 quarter hours offered during a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 15 weeks, if the program admits students who have not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed the equivalent of an associate degree. An eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program must consist of at least 300 clock hours, eight semester 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours, or 12 quarter hours offered during a minimum of ten weeks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the program is an undergraduate program requiring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent of an associate degree for admission or if the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a graduate or professional program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is required to develop regulations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the quality of educational programs of less than 600 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock hours. Those regulations must, at a minimum, require those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational programs to have verified completion and placement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates of at least 70 percent. An educational program of more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 300 clock hours and less than 600 clock hours that meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's regulations qualifies for eligibility under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Family Education Loan programs even if the educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program is not an undergraduate program requiring the equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an associate degree for admission, and even if the educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program is not a graduate or professional program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What is the equivalent of an associates degree? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should be a degree which meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree requirements of any State for an associate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any educational program that meets State licensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements and that equals at least the length of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typical associate degree program. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any educational program leading to a vocational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective if the program is at least 1,800 clock hours, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(60 or 48) semester hours, or (90 or 64) quarter hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(The variation in credit hours depends on whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiators decide to use the number of credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to earn an associate degree or the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credits required for completion of at least two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic years.) [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational program that is at least two academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years in length. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational program leading to licensure in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupation, if a community college offers an associate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree program for that occupation. [Kansas City]

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;An associates degree should be determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional judgment of the Secretary. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should be determined by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's State licensing agency. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should consist of previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training in the same field of study as that for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the eligible program prepares training. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should, for occupations with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apprenticeship programs, require the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five-year apprenticeship programs. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equivalent of two years of successful academic work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a postsecondary environment or a professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license that required a specific period of training and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perhaps work experience. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equivalent of at least two academic years of study, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to compliance with applicable State laws and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 semester hours or the equivalent. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What are other measures of ``quality'' for programs of less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 600 hours? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An educational program should be considered to satisfy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary's quality measures if a program that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares students for State licensure in an occupation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a program that prepares students for certification by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationally recognized professional or industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association; or a program that is approved by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationally recognized accrediting agency or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No additional measures should be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How should the required job placement and graduation rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be calculated? How often should the rates be calculated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The methodology and timing for the calculations should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be identical to those required under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education Act and the Student Right-to-Know and Campus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Calculation of completion rates should be based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula used under the Student Right-to-Know and Campus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act, except that the calculation should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include time-specific constraints. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Calculation of placement rates should be based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula used under the Student Right-to-Know and Campus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act, except that only completers should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted in the denominator. No time frame should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in the calculation. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Regulations should define completion rate, graduation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate, and full-time employment (which should specify a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time in a job). [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Calculations should be based over a two-three year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period to reflect long-term trends and avert the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse impact of short-term problems such as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by economic conditions. Institutions that fall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below the minimum rates ought to be provided appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Because there are many State regulations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency standards governing this area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions should be allowed to follow the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictive ones. Institutions following the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictive regulations and standards should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to maintain multiple sets of documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating compliance with a variety of regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and standards. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The cohort for calculation of placement rates should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include placement in jobs related to the occupation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which students are trained. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In calculating placement rates, students should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted as employed if they obtain jobs within 180 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of graduation. Students should be counted as employed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if they obtain jobs in the field for which they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained or a related field. Students (such as those in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing education or in the military) who are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
looking for a job should be excluded from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation. The calculation should be based on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of graduates. Incarcerated or physically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incapacitated students should be excluded from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What documentation is required to support the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion and job placement rates? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Documentation should be identical to that required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technology Education Act and the Student Right-to-Know 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Campus Security Act. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Documentation should be any documentation required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's State or accrediting agency. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates can be verified through required compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calculations should be included in the Fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operations Report and Application to Participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FISAP) for the campus-based programs. The time-frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for reporting this data should be relatively short, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the data is relevant. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A student's placement information should be maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in each student's file. Placement information should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be available for the purposes of audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should maintain employment records on file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to confirm placements. Employment records should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be submitted to the Department of Education. [Atlanta]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a timely fashion, information relating to its administrative

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should agencies obtain this information from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other agencies should obtain the information through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IPEDS or accrediting agency annual reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Requests should be made in writing to the Chief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should there be a standard information-sharing format? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There should be a standard information sharing format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that the institution is allowed to report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using its accounting system. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There needs to be a standard information sharing format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can be completed readily and corresponds to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's fiscal year. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should provide a single form that can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for all agencies. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Section 487(a)(8)(B) requires institutions that advertise job 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement rates to make available to prospective students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant State licensing requirements for any job for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of instruction is designed to prepare the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How often should institutions be required to update 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing data? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should update the data whenever State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing agencies require that updates or regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must occur. [San Francisco, Kansas City, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Information always needs to be current. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should there be a standard format for providing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to prospective students? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A typical brochure should be used to convey information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to students. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There should not be a standard format for providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this information to prospective students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City, New York, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The institution should use the States required format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for providing consumer data to students. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requires additional information, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information should be consistent with the formats that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution already uses. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Section 487(a)(13) provides that an institution may not deny 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal financial aid to an eligible student because the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is studying abroad in a program approved for credit by the home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should a consortium agreement be required? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A consortium agreement should not be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City, San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A consortium agreement should be used for pre-approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work. Institutions need to ensure that two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions are not giving aid at the same time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A consortium agreement should be required if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student is paying tuition at the home institution and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second institution is involved. Otherwise no consortium agreement should be required. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the study-abroad program have to be part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's program at the home institution? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The study abroad program need not be a part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's program at the home institution, but must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count toward a degree at the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The study abroad program should be a part of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;An institution should not be obligated to enter into an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement with a student who wants to study abroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How should the term ``approved for credit'' be defined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The term ``approved for credit'' should mean that credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are fully transferable (accepted for credit) into an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible program offered by the home institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Approved for credit'' should mean used toward a degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined by the institution. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Approved for credit'' should mean that it is determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in advance that the credit is accepted at the home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Should a standard format be developed for institutions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report study abroad programs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A standard format for institutions to report study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abroad programs is not needed. It does not appear that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any reporting is required. [Kansas City, New York, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Section 487(a)(14)(A) requires a new institution or an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that undergoes a change of ownership or changes its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status as a parent or subordinate institution to develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Default Management Plan to participate in the FFEL program. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary must approve the plan and the plan must be implemented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for two years after the institution is initially certified as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible institution or for two years after its change of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ownership or status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should the criteria in Appendix D of current regulations be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as the basis for the Secretary's approval of default plans? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Unless otherwise required, an institution should use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D or submit any other approved default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management plan. [Kansas City, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If a new institution uses Appendix D, it is subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
things it can't do as a new institution. What is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D that isn't in the new regulations already? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New institutions will certify that they will adopt the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stipulated plan they have in place (that has approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the appropriate State and or accrediting body.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should there be other criteria? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other criteria should include: a) more follow up once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student leaves the institution; and b) additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperation with all partners in the program, i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders, institutions, and secondary markets. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department should reassess the method for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate. It is not fair for most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No other criteria is needed. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Section 487(a)(18)(A) requires an institution that offers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
athletically-related student aid to compile annually data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses and revenues of athletic activities and expenses and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revenues of the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should the terms ``revenues'' and ``expenses'' be defined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There should be coordination with NCAA regulations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit guides. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be allowed to use the accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles and terms they are currently using to define 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``revenues'' and ``expenses.'' [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Section 487(a)(19) provides that if a student is unable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet his or her financial obligation to the institution because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a delay in the disbursement of proceeds of a Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program loan (due to compliance with Title IV requirements or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delays attributable to the institution), the institution may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalize the student in any way, including assessing a late fee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denying the student access to class, the library, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities; or requiring that the student borrow additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should the term ``denial of access to classes'' be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpreted? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Denial of access'' should mean the student is not given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to equipment or supplies. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What should be considered as a condition to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of a ``delay in the delivery of proceeds?''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;This section should not apply to: 1) delays by lenders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or guarantors in delivering loan proceeds which are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by the necessity of complying with Title IV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements; and 2) delays attributable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's not providing information by known, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published, or noticed deadlines, that the institution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lender, or guarantor must have in order to comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV requirements. (Example, IRS 1040 forms for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary should regulate in such a way that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear that institutions may charge reasonable interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on unpaid bills where the delay in Title IV delivery is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributed to the student or an agency other than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;This section does not address delays for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student has not met public deadlines or performed all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations necessary to ensure the delivery of timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the student does not provide documents, it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable. It should relate only to a 30 day delayed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbursement. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No constraints should be put on a student for the delay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that portion of tuition covered by the first-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stafford loan or in the case of institutional delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Consideration should be given to the laws of various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states since they differ as to when a student must meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her financial obligation at an institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If a delay is caused by the lender or institution can the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guarantee agency take actions that are prohibited under other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No, a guaranty agency should not be allowed to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action if the delay is caused by the lender or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;G. Section 487(a)(20) prohibits an institution from paying a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admission activities or in making decisions regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
awarding of student financial assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should the Department determine that an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not providing commissions, bonuses, and other incentive payments? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Compliance should be determined through the audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. Auditors check employment and payroll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records. [San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If an institution awards merit pay to salaried employees in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increments as the student successfully completes portions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course, graduates, or gets placed in a job, would the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be in compliance? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be allowed to provide merit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incentives to employees as long as it cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attached to the enrollment process (i.e., servicing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retaining, and placing students after the first day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class at the institution.) [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Salaried employees should be rewarded for retention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any compensation (non-salaried) for the enrollment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial aid students is illegal. There appears to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposition to compensating for the ``warm body count'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and financial aid packages, but it does seem that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute allows for a legitimate basis for compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above base salary for areas such as retention, however 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined, and/or completion rates. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;As the intent appears to be elimination of head count 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recruitment commissions, bonuses on merit pay may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made as long as they are not made solely as the basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of recruitment of the student. The Department should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define who is an employee. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The institution would be in compliance if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution awards merit pay to salaried employees in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increments as the student successfully completes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions or the course, graduates, or gets placed in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

IV. Annual Audits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A. The Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional and third-party servicer audits. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
487(c)(1)(A)(i) requires an annual audit of the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of the institution in its entirety and an annual audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the institution's compliance with the requirements governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV programs. The institution must make these audits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to cognizant guaranty agencies, eligible lenders, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, and the State review entities designated under subpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To what extent, if any, should the annual audit requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be waived or limited? Should this requirement for annual audits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be waived for institutions participating in the Quality Assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Annual financial audit should be waived in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances except in the case of new institutions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions undergoing a change in ownership, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions with a cohort default rate in excess of 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent for one year, and institutions that did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy all factors of financial responsibility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their most recent financial statement issued to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department. Furthermore, institutions would be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit no more than two consecutive annual audits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before being considered released from the annual audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual compliance audit should be waived for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions except in the case of new institutions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions undergoing a change of ownership, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions which have undergone a compliance audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the past three years which resulted in Title IV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities in excess of one percent of Title IV funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbursed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A further suggestion was made to truncate the audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements if the Secretary continues to require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual audit. A minority of the group felt that annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits, both financial and compliance, should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required and not waived. Those institutions that meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality assurance criteria would be required to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a short form audit on a biannual basis. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No further burden should be placed on institutions than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their State already requires or than the IRS requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of them. If someone else wants the audit, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department should be responsible for distributing them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There should be diminishing filing requirements based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon performance evaluation factors and general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longevity of institutions to exempt an institution from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an annual audit. A minority suggested that pledged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets be accepted at some level in lieu of a certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual audit. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The annual audit requirement could be waived in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas, e.g., the institution could be exempt from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student compliance components but not from a financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit if the institution is in the quality assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should develop a set of guidelines that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would permit exemptions. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. How should guaranty agencies, lenders, and other parties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request audit information from institutions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An audit correction action plan should be sent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agencies and lenders. Requests should be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing with explanations of why the request is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Freedom of Information Act procedures could be used. Requests should be made to the appropriate official on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
campus. Information may not be given to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party without the approval of the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Requests should be in writing to the Chief Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. A minority of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the group believed that all requests should be made in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing to the Chief Financial Officer only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be notified of any requests for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and when information is released to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate agencies. The information should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
released only to the parties already listed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Information should be provided to guaranty agencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders, and other parties upon request. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. In matters not governed by specific provisions, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
487(c)(1)(B) provides for the establishment of standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility and administrative capability that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include any matter the Secretary deems necessary for the sound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of the financial aid programs (such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertinent actions of any owner, shareholder, or person exercising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control over an eligible institution.)

V. Institutional Refund Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 484B(b)(2) requires that each institution participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in any Title IV, HEA program shall have a fair and equitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund policy under which the institution refunds unearned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges, to a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who received Title IV assistance (including Federal PLUS loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received on the student's behalf) for a student who does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

intended or withdraws or otherwise fails to complete the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of enrollment for which assistance is provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution's refund policy is considered to be fair and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equitable if the policy provides for a refund in an amount of at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least the largest of the amounts provided under_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The requirements of applicable State law; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The specific refund standards established by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency if those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are approved by the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute for any student whose withdrawal date is on or before the

60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student has been charged.

The term ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
refund,'' means a refund by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to a student attending that institution for the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of not less than that portion of the tuition, fees, room, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
board, and other charges assessed the student by the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equal to the portion of the period of enrollment for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student has been charged that remains on the last recorded day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendance by the student, rounded downward to the nearest 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of that period, less any unpaid charges owed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student for the period of enrollment for which the student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been charged, and less a reasonable administrative fee not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed the lesser of five percent of the tuition, fees, room and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
board, and other charges assessed the student, or $100.

``The portion of the period of enrollment for which the

student has been charged that remains,'' is determined_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in credit hours, by dividing the total number of weeks comprising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the number of weeks remaining in that period as of the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recorded day of attendance by the student; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in clock hours, by dividing the total number of clock hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprising the period of enrollment for which the student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been charged into the number of clock hours remaining to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed by the student in that period as of the last recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day of attendance by the student; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the case of a correspondence program, by dividing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total number of lessons comprising the period of enrollment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the student has been charged into the number of lessons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not submitted by the student.

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should the ``60 percent point in time'' be determined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should this be based on scheduled time in the program or actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendance? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;The ``60 percent point in time'' should be based on scheduled time in the program, not on actual attendance.
[Kansas City, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In the absence of formal withdrawal by the student, it is up to the institution to devise a mechanism to determine
the last date of attendance. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. How should the term ``student who is attending the institution for the first time'' be defined? Should this mean
the first time ever or the first time at the institution? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Only first year, first-time students should be considered ``first time.'' [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``A student who is attending such institution for the first time'' should be defined as the first time ever rather
than the first time at an institution. Some attendees favored defining ``first time'' as the first time at the institution.
Pro ration should continue until the student finishes his or her first period of enrollment for which they have been
charged, or until the student has withdrawn from that term, class, or program for which they have been charged. If the
student re-enters the institution, they would not be considered a first time student. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``First-time student'' is a student at that particular institution in their first scheduled period of enrollment
for which the student has been charged. [New York, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``First-time student'' should be defined as a student enrolled for the first time at the institution in an eligible
program. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulations should not determine a minimum program length to consider a student as attending at a prior
institution or current institution. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If a student enrolls for any period of time, drops out, then returns, they are not considered enrolled for the
first time for the second enrollment period. If standard terms of enrollment are used, the student should be considered
first time for the first term of enrollment for which they were charged. If standard terms are not used, the lesser of
60 percent of the first academic year or 60 percent of the program should be used. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How should the term ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' be defined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The term ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be left to the institution to
define based on scheduled time. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined based on full charges
for the increment of the enrollment period defined by the institution as the ``period for charges.'' [Kansas City]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined as the length of time for
which the student was initially charged. For example, for an institution that charges by semester, the first semester
the student was charged is the relevant period of enrollment. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined as a minimum of one academic
term, quarter, or semester or, for clock hour institutions, as a minimum of one-third of an academic year. If the institution
charges for a full program, the length of the program should be defined as an academic period. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined as the length for which
a student would be eligible to receive Title IV assistance. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Should the regulations address specific requirements regarding the treatment of equipment or book costs to be
included in pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculations? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Books and supplies should be excluded from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 calculation. Only fees for services rendered over time, e.g., lab fees, should be included. Exclude ``up front''
fees (application) and books, supplies, and equipment up to a certain dollar amount. There is a difference between
a service fee and a purchase of supplies, equipment, and books. Purchases should be excluded. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulations should state that equipment, books supplies, telephone charges, parking fines, etc. should
not be included with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements. [Kansas City, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Charges for equipment, instructional materials, etc. should not be included in the calculation for refund
purposes if separately charged by the institution. [San Francisco]

&bull;If books and supplies are provided by the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the institution has delivered the books and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies to the student, the books and supplies should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be excluded from the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Certain fees assessed by the institution should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

pro rata

not realize the benefits over the enrollment period to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include one time charges, i.e., application fee, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orientation charges, testing fees, and deferred payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fees. Other charges assessed by the institution should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be excluded from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund when the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not realize the benefit over the enrollment period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include fines, penalties, and individual charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., parking fines, and health center charges.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Books and supplies should not be included in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund unless they are considered a mandatory charge by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution (i.e, not when the student has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of buying from the institution or some other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source.) [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If all equipment and books are purchased at one time or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued to the student before he or she terminates his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or her enrollment, the cost should be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund. The institution should charge the whole amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is not returnable. Equipment must be returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and able to be used again. If equipment has not yet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been issued, the student would be eligible for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 percent refund. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Should the regulations address a time frame for student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunds? Should the regulations have a minimum program length 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a student must complete before the student will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be attending ``for the first time?'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The time frame for all refunds should be uniformly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 days from the date the institution becomes aware 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a student has withdrawn. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulations should indicate the time frame for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuing student refunds to be the same as current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund requirements- within 60 days of determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a refund is in order. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Refunds should be made 30 days from date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Regulations should not address a time frame for refunds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since it is already addressed by the State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agencies. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Should the regulations address how institutions will account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for credit balances? Should these funds be kept in a restrictive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account rather than the institution's general operating account? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulations should not address how institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account for credit balances nor restrictive or general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating accounts. A minority of the group felt that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students with a baccalaureate degree should be exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the language. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The group recommends that regulations remain silent on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the method by which institutions account for credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balances. [San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;After all returns have been made to the Federal program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from which the funds came, there should be a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time for the student to request his account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance if there are educational costs outstanding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Since the statute would imply than an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to calculate all three policies and make the payment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the one most generous, should the institution be allowed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine which is generally most generous an make that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official refund policy? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be allowed to determine the refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy that is generally most generous and use that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy. Institutions would define ``generally most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generous.'' [Kansas City, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should issue guidelines for institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use in determining which method to use. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions use average costs in awarding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging, average costs should be used in refunds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should not be allowed to determine which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund is ``generally most generous.'' This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent with the statute. The statute does, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, permit institution to develop an algorithm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that integrates the three refund policies and yields 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calculation ``most generous'' to each individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student. The requirements should apply only to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of refunds for students who are recipients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of financial aid under Title IV. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. How should ``fair and equitable'' be defined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fair and equitable'' should be defined as most generous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the student. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It is not necessary to define ``fair and equitable'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately from the requirements of the statute and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The Student Commission addresses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately the definition of ``fair and equitable.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Under section 485(a), additional provisions have been added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the list of information an institution must disclose, upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request, to students and prospective students as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student consumerism requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The institution's refund policy must identify that refunds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be credited in the following order: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) To outstanding balances on Federal Family Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should regulations require institutions to publicize how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunds will be processed and what refunds students are entitled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to receive in the event that the institution closes? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Regulations should require institutions to publicize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how refunds will be processed and what funds students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are entitled to receive in the event the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closes. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should not have to publicize how refunds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be processed and what funds students are entitled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to receive in the event the institution closes. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not a consumer information issue. This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to be disbursed if the institution closes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information should be available to students upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request. A statement could be put in the catalog that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will lead the student to ask relevant questions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department should work with State Agencies to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans that should be made available to students on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request. There is very little probability that certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strong institutions will close. All institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be required to disclose this.

[San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should consumer information address teachouts or other State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or accrediting agency mandated requirements to protect student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers in the case of school closure? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Should institutional discretion be permitted when

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This should be done at the institution's discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions should not be required to pay back money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they have not received, i.e., guaranty and origination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fees. Institution should be permitted to include these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fees if they choose. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. How should the guaranty agencies monitor students to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that multiple FFEL funds are treated as one for the purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
billing and deferments from one lender? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Guaranty agency monitoring of students to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple FFEL funds are treated as one for the purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of billing and deferments from one lender should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handled under the FFEL program. This is not a consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information issue. [Kansas City, San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Guaranty agency monitoring of students to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple FFEL funds are treated as one for the purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of billing and deferments from one lender should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
done through the National Student Loan Data Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies should identify all loans obtained through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that agency. [Atlanta]

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What information should the Secretary require on the form to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplement the specific information required by the statute? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Information should include documentation of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's accreditation or preaccreditation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree-granting authority, authority to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postsecondary education, and State licensure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;With one exception, participants were satisfied that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information currently collected on the Department's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application forms is adequate, and new requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would needlessly add burden. One participant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended a separate application for proprietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Specific categories should be established for different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of institutions and academic functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information should include the names and social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security numbers of key administrative personnel and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
board members. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provided that new information required by statute is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected (financial statements, description of student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid processing at the institution, information on main 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and branch campuses, and information on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's third-party servicers), information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently collected is sufficient. However, additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information should be collected on whether an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's owner has had substantial control over a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed institution that owes refunds to students or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should the Audit Guide be revised to require the auditor to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify the information on the application form? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Participants recommended no changes in the audit guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A minority of participants indicated that there should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be changes, without specifying what changes are needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Section 498(c)(1) addresses financial responsibilities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires an institution to show that it is able to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promised services, to provide administrative resources necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Title IV duties, and the meet all of its financial obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including refunds and repayments to the Secretary for Title IV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What information should be required from an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit the Secretary to determine that the institution provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the services described in its official publications and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No additional information needs to be collected from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. [Kansas City, San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the Secretary needs additional information, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary should be able to collect it from data made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available through State and accrediting functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City, New York, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The best way to obtain information would be through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site visits. [New York, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department needs to take action on institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with failing financial statements, rather than simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collect them. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The establishment of uniform financial standards would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be difficult, because different standards need to apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to different types of institutions. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
2. What supporting information should be submitted to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution has the administrative resources to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with its program responsibilities? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The financial information concerning each branch campus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an institution should be evaluated, without simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relying on the financial information of an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a whole. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Employee biographies with social security numbers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be provided. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What level of financial resources are needed to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution can meet potential refund and repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations, and should institutions be required to set aside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds for these purposes? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution should be able to provide for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment of refunds that could occur over a 30-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, but the institution should not be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set aside funds specifically for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The statutory provisions for institutions to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cash reserves unless they are covered by State tuition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery plans should be sufficient. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No requirements are necessary. The Department should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the discretion to review and establish amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when necessary. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Section 498(c)(2) requires that, notwithstanding section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
498(c)(1), if an institution fails to meet the criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed by the Secretary with respect to operating losses, net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worth, asset-to-liabilities ratios, or operating fund deficits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution must provide the Secretary with satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence of its financial responsibility in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 498(c)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What standards should be set for each of these criteria? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;One standard should not be applicable to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be allowed to explain their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements before decisions in this area are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The institutions financial condition should be examined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over a certain time period so that decisions regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its financial responsibility are based on a trend. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should particularly consider an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's statement of cash flow. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ratios that are used to measure stability in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business world should be used. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Current standards should be used with Departmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Standards for these criteria should be: a ratio of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets to liabilities of 1:1, showing a positive net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worth, and not having two consecutive years of negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating cash flow or its equivalent for fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting purposes. These should be indicators of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility, not absolute minimums. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance of each criteria should be given its proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Section 498(c)(3) provides that the Secretary may find an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to be financially responsible, notwithstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure under 498(c)(1) and 498(c)(2), if the institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provides third-party guarantees of at least one-half of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual potential liabilities, (2) is backed by the full faith and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit of a State or its equivalent, (3) establishes that it is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
going concern capable of meeting all its obligations, or (4) has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met comparable standards set by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What type of third-party guarantees will be acceptable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Acceptable third-party guarantees should include bonds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional collateral, or a tuition recovery fund. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Acceptable third-party guarantees should include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance bonds, letters of credit, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparable instruments. [Kansas City, Atlanta]

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;Acceptable third-party guarantees should include performance bonds, letters of credit, third-party escrow
arrangements, and certificates of deposit. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Under what conditions will each type of instrument be used? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;These measures should be used for institutions that close or institutions that don't properly repay any required
refunds. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;These measures should be used only if the institution can find no other way to prove its financial status. The
institution should have an opportunity to negotiate with the Department before the third-party guarantees are imposed.
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;These measures should be used anytime the Secretary determines that the institution is not meeting its financial
responsibilities. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;These measures should be used if an institution fails to satisfy a liability established by the Secretary after
an administrative review process. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How does the Secretary determine the amount equal to one-half of the annual potential liabilities of an institution,
which is the minimum guarantee amount? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;This should be determined based on the institution's retention or refund history. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The annual potential liability should be defined as the sum of the difference between charges paid by the student
(regardless of the source of payment) and the pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 amounts earned by the institution according to its applicable refund policy. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The annual potential liability should be based upon the institution's annual Title IV funds multiplied by
one-half of its withdrawal rate. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What standards will be used to determine when guarantees in excess of the minimum amount will be required for an institution
that fails to demonstrate financial responsibility? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Guarantees in excess of the minimum amount should be required if the institution must also have funds to make
teach out arrangements. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Guarantees in excess of the minimum amount should not be imposed. [Kansas City, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Guarantees in excess of the minimum amount should be required when the institution cannot meet its current
financial obligations. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. How can an institution that does not demonstrate financial responsibility otherwise show that it is capable of
meeting all of its financial obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All factors must be analyzed as a whole. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should use the process used by accrediting agencies to determine financial responsibility.
[New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be considered financially responsible if they are on reimbursement. [Kansas City, Atlanta]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be considered financially responsible if they are funded through an escrow arrangement.
[San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Section 498(c)(4) provides that the determination that an institution has met certain standards of financial
responsibility will be based on an audited and certified financial statement, done in accordance with standards
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Additional audits may be required.

Issues that the community was asked to address and the community's views:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. When would the Secretary require additional audits, and what additional items should be required for such audits?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should be able to request a more detailed audit of a particular segment of the audited financial
statement. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should take into account the cost of requests for additional information. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should be able to request the more frequent submission of audited financial statements in cases
of fraud, abuse, or a negative program review finding. For additional submissions requested at the Secretary's discretion,
it is suggested that the Secretary be willing to look at something other than a full audited financial statement. [Kansas
City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;At the discretion of the Secretary, additional reports could include CPA prepared 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
statements, cash forecasts, enrollment forecasts, and operating budgets with comparisons of actual to budget.
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There should be no need for interim reports since they are now required annually. If interim information is
requested, it should be unaudited. However, if an institution is seeking relief from a previously imposed fiscal
restriction before its next scheduled statement, the interim statement should be audited. [Atlanta]

2. What guidelines and time periods should be set for provisional certification? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Each institution should be treated on a case-by-case basis subject to the Secretary's discretion. [New York]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A two-year time period should be used for provisional certification. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The time period should not exceed three-years and the institution should have the ability to achieve full certification
sooner. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Section 498(c)(5) provides that an institution must maintain sufficient cash reserves to ensure repayment of
any required refunds. Institutions that participate in and contribute to a State tuition recovery fund would be exempt
from this requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the community's views
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What are sufficient cash reserves? How are they measured, what types of funds may be included, and how are they protected
from use for other purposes? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Sufficient cash reserves should be defined as a certain percent of unearned tuition based on the institution's
refund history and established only when there is an indication of a problem or high-risk institution. This could
be part of provisional certification. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Sufficient cash reserves should be defined as 100 percent of any unearned tuition liability from Title IV awards.
A minority of the group thought an amount to cover loans where the loan guarantee might be invalidated because of fraud
should also be included. Cash reserves should include cash, accounts receivable, and liquid assets that can be converted
to cash within 30 days. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the institution has been timely (60 days) in processing refunds for one year, no cash reserves should be required.
If the institution has not been timely, an increasing percentage should be reserved based on the total Title IV funds
processed by the institution. The regulations should be written to provide incentives for institutions with a good
performance record. The Department should take into account whether the refunds were delinquent because of personnel
problems as compared to a poor financial position. When an institution is required to reserve cash, any earnings should
accrue to the institution. Letters of credit should be permitted as a substitute for a cash reserve. [San Francisco]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A cash reserve is sufficient if it equals anticipated refund to be paid during a 30 day period based on the average
of refunds paid during the preceding 12 month period. Cash reserves are defined as cash and cash equivalents plus other
current assets that can be converted to cash within 30 days. Segregation of the cash reserve is not required by law nor
is it desirable. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What are the components of a state tuition recovery fund that demonstrates that an institution contributing to
the fund will be able to pay refunds? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If an institution contributes to a State tuition recovery fund they should be exempt automatically from this
requirement. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The components of a State tuition recovery fund that will demonstrate that an institution contributing to
the fund will be able to pay refunds are those tuition recovery components that will pay a lender the required refund
and/or pay the student the required refund. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What information must institutions provide to permit the Secretary to determine that an institution will be able
to use the tuition recovery fund to pay refunds if the institution itself is unable to do so? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution should provide a letter from the State that confirms that they will be able to use the State tuition
recovery fund to pay refunds. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution should provide a description of the legal structure of the fund and audited financial statements
so the Secretary may determine that the institution will be able to use the tuition recovery fund. [San Francisco]

4. Should the Secretary compile and maintain a list of State

tuition recovery funds if that meets the requirements that permit

an institution's participation in that fund to operate in lieu of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution should provide the name and address of

the State tuition recovery fund to confirm that they

G. Section 498(d) authorizes the Secretary to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures and standards relating to administrative capability, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the consideration of past performance of institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or individuals in control of such institutions and maintenance of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What measures of past performance will be used, and what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time periods should be included in the review? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No other standards of administrative capability or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility should be considered. There 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is an inundation of oversight responsibility and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements placed on institutions is sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In certain cases, institutional administrators should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet a minimum experience requirement (e.g., five years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of prior experience in administration.) [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;School owners, corporate directors and officers, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the chief school administrator should be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor and investigate school compliance, take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whatever steps are within the person's authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect the correction of non-compliance, and report to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department, the accrediting agency, and the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing agency any non-compliance that has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected. California law requires this. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The current &sect;668.14 and &sect;668.15 should be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure administrative capability with the exception of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the withdrawal rates. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A minority of the group recommended that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
look into all complaints filed against institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the local law enforcement authorities even though 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the complaint may not warrant pulling of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's license or loss of accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should look at the past two audits to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
see that performance reviews have corrected all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies as a basis that the institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administratively capable. This should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined arbitrarily, but should be determined by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Research data is needed to establish a basis for past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. Other measures of past performance that

should be used: Placement, default and withdrawal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates, past performance reviews and implementation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations, personnel turnover, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Default rates, course completion and withdrawal rates, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and job placement rates must be considered together. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These should be triggers that, in certain combinations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should cause more review of administrative capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mitigating circumstances must be considered.

[New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;Standards for default rates, course completion and

applicable to all institutions. No new standards

should be set without historical data. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Student or consumer complaints against an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be taken into consideration if a pattern of

legitimate complaints indicate a need for review by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside entity. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There should be no standard measure of an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability with respect to student or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer complaints against an institution. The

&bull;In cases where the eligibility process requires a site

visit, and the Secretary is unable to perform the site

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the expiration date until the eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is completed. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Section 498(h) provides that the Secretary may provisionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify an institution for not more than one year for initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, or three years under certain conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisional certification may be withdrawn if the institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unable to meet its responsibilities. Also, if an accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's recognition is withdrawn, the Secretary may continue the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility of accredited institutions for up to 18 months.

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What standards should be used to determine whether an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may be granted provisionally certification? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution could be provisionally certified if it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not meet the third criterion for financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility in section 498(c) of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For an initial application, the Secretary should rely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the statutory language. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution should be provisionally certified if it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is unable to meet a regulatory standard for a reason 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the institution's control. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Secretary should use the same standards that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for determining financial responsibility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution that meets all requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification other than the completion of a required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site visit should be provisionally certified if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary is unable to conduct the site visit in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely manner. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What procedures and standards should the Secretary use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decide whether an institution that has received provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification is unable to meet its responsibilities? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Before revoking an institution's participation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary should conduct proceedings for a hearing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should provisionally certify an institution until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion of those proceedings. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Secretary should use the same standards that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for determining financial responsibility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Secretary should use the results of audits, audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements, and program reviews to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether to certify an institution provisionally and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct a site visit at the institution. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Under what circumstances should the Secretary continue the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility of accredited institutions where their accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency loses its recognition? Should the period of extension be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same for all institutions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;According to a minority of participants, an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified as having administrative capability problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be provisionally certified for no more than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All institutions should be provisionally certified for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18 months, and the Secretary should ensure that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is available for such institutions to become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accredited by another agency. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Eligibility should be continued in all cases and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same period of time for all institutions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary should notify an institution promptly of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's action, the institution should promptly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply for accreditation with another agency and notify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution of that fact, and the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should make a good-faith effort to expedite its

accreditation. [Atlanta]

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to document the analysis and disclose the
environmental impacts of proposed actions to salvage harvest timber and improve productivity of stands of trees
in portions of the Muddy Creek, Twelvemile Creek, Sixmile Creek, and Ferron Creek Drainages. The project is located
approximately 10 air miles southeast of Manti, Utah.

The entire proposal area involves some 30,000 acres of which approximately 10,000 acres is forested with an Engelmann
spruce cover type. A bark beetle epidemic has affected the major portion of this type. the need for the proposal is established
by the silvicultural condition of the affected timber stands and forest goals as outlined in the Manti-La Sal National
Forest Land and Resource Management Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six areas that were inventoried as roadless as part of the RARE II evaluation are adjacent to and in some cases overlap
the proposal. These areas were released back to full Multiple Use management by the Utah Wilderness Act and were evaluated
for a variety of designations in the Forest's analysis during the Forest Land and Resource Plan process which was completed
in 1986. The current analysis will document effects that would substantially alter the undeveloped character of
these areas.

This EIS will tier to the final EIS for the Manti-La Sal National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan).
The Manti-La Sal Forest Plan provides the overall guidance (Goals, Objectives, Standards, and Management Area Direction)
to achieve the Desired Future Condition for the area being analyzed, and contains specific management area prescriptions
for the entire Forest.

A National forest Management Act Analysis for this proposal was completed in 1993. As a result of that analysis and
additional scoping the Manti-La Sal concluded the proposal may have a significant effect on the roadless character
of some of the surrounding areas, and because of the scope of the project size it was decided to prepare this EIS. The
previous scoping and analysis also identified the following potential issues related to the proposed action:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What will be the effects of the proposal on the habitats, behavior, and local population of certain wildlife species?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What effect will the proposed activities have on the access, quality, and safety of the recreational opportunities
of the area?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How will the proposal alter the present visual quality?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What will be the effects of the proposal on cultural resources?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How will potential build up of dead, down, woody, ground fuels be effected by the proposal?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How will the proposal contribute to a healthy, productive forest that will economically provide timber for the market
place on a sustainable basis for the present and the future?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What effect will the proposal have on the transportation systems presently serving the area?

Steps 2, 3, and 4 will be completed through the scoping process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 5 will consider a range of alternatives developed from the key issues. One of these will be the ``No Action'' alternative.
Other alternatives will consider various methods, levels and locations of harvest, regeneration, and related road
development/improvement in response to issues, and non-timber objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 6 will describe the physical attributes of the area to be affected by this proposal, with special attention to
the environmental factors that could be adversely affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 7 will analyze the environmental effects of each alternative. This analysis will be consistent with management
direction outlined in the Forest Plan. The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of each alternative will be analyzed
and documented. In addition, the site specific mitigation measures for each alternative will be identified and the
effectiveness of these mitigation measures will be disclosed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approximate boundary of the area covered for this analysis will be from the southern Forest boundary along White
Mountain north along Skyline Drive to the Ferron and Sixmile drainages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed management activities would be administered by the Sanpete and Ferron Ranger Districts of the Manti-La
Sal National Forest in Sanpete and Sevier Counties, Utah.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency representatives and other interested people are invited to visit with Forest Service officials at any time
during the EIS process. Two specific time periods are identified for the receipt of formal comments on the analysis.
The two comment periods are, (1) during the scoping process, the next 30 days following publication of this Notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and (2) during the formal review period of the Draft EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Draft EIS is estimated to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review
in June, 1994. At this time the EPA will publish an availability notice of the Draft EIS in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability
appears in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time. To be the most helpful,
comments on the Draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits
of the alternatives discussed (See The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural
provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of draft environmental impact statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewers' position and contentions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns related to the proposed action, comments
on the Draft EIS should be as specific as possible. Referring to specific pages or chapters of the Draft EIS is most helpful.
Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed
in the statement. (Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing
the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, 40 CFR 1503.3, in addressing these points.)

The Forest Supervisor for the Manti-La Sal National Forest, who is the responsible official for the EIS, will then
make a decision regarding this proposal, after considering the comments, responses, and environmental consequences
discussed in the Final Environmental Impact Statement, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The reasons
for the decision will be documented in a Record of Decisions.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to requests from interested parties, the Department of Commerce has conducted administrative reviews
of the antidumping duty orders on antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. The classes or kinds of merchandise
covered by these orders are ball bearings, cylindrical roller bearings, and spherical plain bearings. The reviews
cover 38 manufacturers/exporters and the period May 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993 (the POR). Although we initiated
reviews for nine other manufacturers/exporters, we are terminating the reviews because the requests for these reviews
were withdrawn in a timely manner. As a result of these reviews, the Department has preliminarily determined the weighted-average
dumping margins for the reviewed firms to range from 0.37 percent to 132.25 percent for BBs, from zero to 51.82 percent
for CRBs, and from zero to 92.00 percent for SPBs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Specifically, these orders cover BBs, CRBs, and SPBs from France, Germany, and Japan; BBs and CRBs from Italy, Sweden,
and the U.K.; and BBs from Singapore and Thailand. On June 28, 1993, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(c)(1993), we initiated
administrative reviews of those orders for the period May 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993 (58 FR 34563). The Department
is now conducting these administrative reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended
(the Tariff Act). These reviews cover the following firms and classes or kinds of merchandise:

Subsequent to the publication of our initiation notice, we received timely withdrawals of review requests for INA
(France), SNECMA (France and Italy), Asahi Seiko (Japan), Fujino Iron Works (Japan), Tottori Yamakei Bearing Seisakusho
(Japan), and Revolvo (U.K.). Because there were no other requests for review of these companies from any other interested
parties, we are terminating the reviews with respect to these companies, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5).

On January 13, 1994, GMN also requested that the Department allow GMN to withdraw its request for review and terminate
the review of the order on BBs from Germany with respect to GMN. Although its request to withdraw was submitted well
after the deadline for doing so, GMN claimed that the circumstances of the firm's bankruptcy rendered it unable to
proceed further with the review. After giving careful consideration to GMN's circumstances, we find that it would
be inappropriate to terminate the review. GMN's request to terminate the review was submitted during the verification
process, which is an advanced stage of the review process, and at a point at which it had become clear that the company
would be unable to complete verification successfully. Furthermore, a domestic interested party objected to termination
of the review at that stage. Therefore, we are not terminating the review of GMN.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we initiated reviews for SST Bearing Corp. (SST), and Peer International (Peer) with respect to subject
merchandise from Japan. SST informed us that it neither produced AFBs in Japan nor exported Japanese-produced bearings
to the United States. Peer informed us that although it is a reseller of Japanese-made bearings, all of its suppliers
had knowledge at the time of sale that the merchandise was destined for the United States. Consequently, Peer is not
a reseller as defined in 19 CFR 353.2(s) because its sales cannot be used to calculate the U.S. price. Therefore, we
are preliminarily terminating the reviews with respect to SST and Peer. If we obtain any information that contradicts
these companies' assertions, we will complete the reviews with respect to these companies.

Best Information Available
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, we have preliminarily determined that the use of best information
available (BIA) is appropriate for certain firms. The Department's regulations provide that we may take into account
whether a party refuses to provide information in determining what is the best information available (19 CFR 353.37(b)).
For purposes of these reviews and in accordance with past Commerce practice, we have used the most adverse BIA_generally
the highest rate for any company for the class or kind of merchandise from the same country from this or any prior segment
of the proceeding, including the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation_whenever a company refused to cooperate
with the Department or otherwise significantly impeded the proceeding. When a company substantially cooperated
with our requests for information, but failed to provide all information requested in a timely manner or in the form
requested, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest rate (including the ``all others'' rate) ever applicable to
the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from the same country from either the LTFV investigation or a prior
administrative review; or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for any firm for the class or kind of merchandise
from the same country (see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping
Duty Order, 58 FR 39728 (July 26, 1993)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because Franke &amp; Heydrich, General Bearing Corp., and SNFA failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire,
we have used the highest rate ever found for each relevant class or kind of merchandise and country of origin. Also,
because GMN had substantially cooperated with our requests for information, but was unable to complete verification,
we used as BIA its highest previous rate, in this case the rate from the LTFV investigation.

Intent to Revoke
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The following firms have submitted requests, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(b), to revoke the orders covering the
indicated merchandise:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(a)(2)(iii), these requests were accompanied by certifications from the firms that
they had not sold the relevant class or kind of merchandise at less than fair value for a three-year period including
this review period, and will not do so in the future. Each of these firms also agreed to its immediate reinstatement
in the relevant antidumping orders, as long as it is subject to those orders, if the Department concludes under 19 CFR
353.22(f) that, subsequent to revocation, it sold the subject merchandise at less than fair value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the two prior reviews of these orders, we determined that SPBs from France sold by SKF, BBs from Germany sold by NTN
Kugellagerfabrik and GMN, CRBs from Italy sold by SKF, and BBs, CRBs, and SPBs from Japan sold by Honda were not sold
at less than fair value. In this review, we preliminarily determine that these firms, with the exception of NTN Germany
and GMN, have not sold these products at less than fair value, which will satisfy the three-year period of no sales at
less than fair value, if these preliminary findings are affirmed in our final results. Therefore, we intend to revoke
the orders with respect to the following firms and merchandise:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
With respect to SPBs from Japan sold by NTN and BBs from Germany sold by NTN and GMN, we have not established that there
has been a three-year period of sales at not less than fair value. The final results of the previous administrative
review indicated the existence of dumping margins on NTN's sales of SPBs from Japan (see Final Results of Antidumping
Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order, 58 FR 39729, July 26, 1993). In addition,
we preliminarily determine in this review that there are dumping margins on NTN's sales of BBs from Germany. Therefore,
we do not intend to revoke the orders on SPBs from Japan with respect to NTN or on BBs from Germany with respect to NTN.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning GMN, as BIA, (see ``Best Information Available'' section above), we have preliminarily determined that
dumping margins exist on GMN's sales of BBs from Germany during the 1992&hyph;93 review period. Furthermore, on February
10, 1994, the company withdrew its request for revocation. Therefore, we do not intend to revoke the order on BBs from
Germany with respect to GMN.

United States Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating United States price (USP), the Department used purchase price (PP) or exporter's sales price (ESP),
as defined in section 772 of the Tariff Act, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the extremely large number of transactions that occurred during the POR and the resulting administrative burden
involved in calculating individual margins for all of these transactions, we sampled sales to calculate USP, in accordance
with section 777A of the Tariff Act. When a firm made more than 2,000 ESP sales transactions to the United States for
a particular class or kind of merchandise, we reviewed ESP sales which occurred during sample weeks. We selected one
week from each two-month period in the review period, for a total of six weeks, and analyzed each transaction made in
those six weeks. The sample weeks included May 31&hyph;June 6, 1992; July 26&hyph;August 1, 1992; October 18&hyph;24,
1992; November 22&hyph;28, 1992; February 14&hyph;20, 1993; and April 18&hyph;24, 1993. We reviewed all PP sales
transactions during the POR because there were few PP sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States price was based on the packed f.o.b., c.i.f., or delivered price to unrelated purchasers in, or for exportation
to, the United States. We made deductions, as appropriate, from PP and ESP for movement expenses, discounts and rebates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made additional deductions from ESP for direct selling expenses, indirect selling expenses, and repacking in
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made an addition to USP for value-added taxes (VAT) in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act. In
making our adjustment for VAT, we followed the instructions of the United States Court of International Trade (CIT)
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT October 7, 1993). The Department added to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market
tax rate by the price of the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market
tax was applied to foreign market sales. The Department also adjusted the tax amount calculated for USP and the amount
of tax included in foreign market value (FMV). We deducted the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax that
are the result of expenses that are included in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and in
the United States price used to calculate the USP tax. Because these expenses are later deducted to calculate FMV and
USP, these adjustments are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating the USP tax from creating dumping
margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign market sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to subject merchandise to which value was added in the United States, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 parts of bearings that were imported and further processed into finished bearings by U.S. affiliates of foreign exporters,
prior to sale to unrelated U.S. customers, we deducted any increased value in accordance with section 772(e)(3) of
the Tariff Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those bearings otherwise subject to the order that are incorporated into nonbearing products, which collectively
comprise less than one percent of the value of the finished products sold to unrelated customers in the United States,
are not subject to the assessment of antidumping duties. In Roller Chain, Other Than Bicycle, from Japan (48 FR 51801;
November 14, 1983), roller chain, which was subject to an antidumping duty order, was imported by a related party and
incorporated into finished motorcycles. The finished motorcycles were the first articles of commerce sold by the
subject producer to unrelated purchasers in the United States. Because the roller chain did not constitute a significant
percentage of the value of the completed product, the Department found that a USP could not reasonably be determined
for the roller chain. The Department, therefore, did not assess dumping duties on these transactions. We have applied
this same principle to these reviews.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The home market was viable for all companies and all classes or kinds of merchandise. The Department used home market
prices or constructed value (CV), as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, as appropriate, to calculate foreign
market value (FMV). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the extremely large number of transactions that occurred during the POR and the resulting administrative burden
involved in examining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of these transactions, we sampled sales to calculate FMV, in accordance with section 777A of the Tariff Act. When
a firm had more than 2,000 home market sales transactions for a particular class or kind of merchandise, we used sales
from sample months that corresponded to the sample weeks selected for U.S. sales sampling plus one contemporaneous
month prior to the POR and one following the POR. The sample months included March, June, July, October, and November
of 1992, and February, April, and June of 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department relies on monthly weighted-average prices in the calculation of FMV in administrative
reviews. Because of the significant volume of home market sales involved in these reviews, we examined whether it
was appropriate to average, in accordance with section 777A of the Tariff Act, all of each respondent's home market
sales on an annual basis. In this case, the use of POR weighted-average prices results in significant time and resource
savings for the Department. To determine whether a POR weighted-average price was representative of the transactions
under consideration, we performed a three-step test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We first compared each monthly weighted-average home market price for each model with the weighted-average POR price
of that model. We calculated the proportion of each model's sales whose POR weighted-average price did not vary meaningfully
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was within plus or minus 10 percent) from the monthly weighted-average prices. We did this for each model within each
class or kind of merchandise. We then compared the volume of sales of all models within each class or kind of merchandise
whose POR weighted-average price did not vary meaningfully from the monthly weighted-average price with the total
volume of sales of that class or kind of merchandise. If the POR weighted-average price of at least 90 percent of sales
in each class or kind of merchandise did not vary meaningfully from the monthly weighted-average price, we considered
the POR weighted-average prices to be representative of the transactions under consideration. Finally, we tested
whether there was any correlation between fluctuations in price and time for the home market sales. Where the correlation
coefficient was less than 0.05 (where a coefficient approaching 1.0 means a direct relation between price and time,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that prices consistently rise from month to month, and a coefficient approaching zero means no relation between prices
and time), we concluded that there was no significant relation between price and time. We calculated a weighted-average
POR FMV only for those classes or kinds that satisfied our three-step test for the factors of price, volume, and time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We compared U.S. sales with sales of such or similar merchandise in the home market. We considered all non-identical
products within a bearing family to be equally similar. As defined in the questionnaire, a bearing family consists
of all bearings within a class or kind of merchandise that are the same in the following physical characteristics:
load direction, bearing design, number of rows of rolling elements, precision rating, dynamic load rating, and outer
diameter, inner diameter, and width. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home market prices were based on the packed, ex-factory or delivered prices to related or unrelated purchasers in
the home market. Where applicable, we made adjustments for movement expenses, differences in cost attributable
to differences in physical characteristics of the merchandise, and differences in packing. We also made adjustments
for differences in circumstances of sale in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56. For comparisons to PP sales, we deducted
home market direct selling expenses and added U.S. direct selling expenses. For comparisons to ESP sales, we deducted
home market direct selling expenses. We also made adjustments, where applicable, for home market indirect selling
expenses to offset U.S. commissions in PP and ESP calculations and to offset U.S. indirect selling expenses deducted
in ESP calculations, but not exceeding the amount of the indirect U.S. expenses. For comparisons to both ESP and PP
sales, we adjusted for VAT using the methodology detailed in the ``United States Price'' section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We used sales to related customers only where we determined such sales were made at arm's length,

 at prices comparable to prices at which the firm sold identical merchandise to unrelated customers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where we found home market sales below the cost of production in the previous administrative review period, we concluded
that reasonable grounds exist to believe or suspect that home market sales during the POR were made at prices below
the cost of production, and we therefore initiated cost investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 773(b) of the Tariff Act, in determining whether to disregard home market sales made at
prices below the cost of production, we examined whether such sales were made in substantial quantities over an extended
period of time. When less than 10 percent of the home market sales of a particular model were at prices below the cost
of production, we found that substantial quantities of such sales were not made and did not disregard any sales of that
model. When 10 percent or more, but not more than 90 percent, of the home market sales of a particular model were determined
to be below cost, we determined that substantial quantities of such sales were made and excluded the below-cost home
market sales from our calculation of FMV provided that these below-cost sales were made over an extended period of
time. When more than 90 percent of the home market sales of a particular model were made below cost over an extended period
of time, we disregarded all home market sales of that model from our calculation of FMV and went to CV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine if sales below cost had been made over an extended period of time, we compared the number of months in which
sales below cost had occurred for a particular model to the number of months in which the model was sold. If the model
was sold in three or fewer months, we did not find that below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time unless
there were sales below cost of that model in each month. If a model was sold in more than three months, we did not find that
below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time unless there were sales below cost in at least three of the
months in which the model was sold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since none of the respondents has submitted information indicating that any of its sales below cost were at prices
which would have permitted ``recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade,''
within the meaning of section 773(b)(2) of the Tariff Act, we were unable to conclude that the costs of production of
such sales were recovered within a reasonable period. As a result, we disregarded below-cost sales when the conditions
described above were met.

Home market sales of obsolete merchandise and distress sales were not disregarded in our cost analysis unless there
was documented information on the record demonstrating that such sales were outside the ordinary course of trade.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to FAG Germany, we disregarded certain sales reported by the company in its home market database. The
disregarded sales pertain to two unrelated German resellers of FAG bearings. Although FAG reported that it did not
know whether these resellers sold its bearings in Germany or abroad, we preliminarily determine, based on the following
information obtained at verification, that FAG, at a minimum, should have known that the two resellers would export
its bearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At verification, we found that FAG referred, both orally and in its records, to these resellers as ``indirect exporters.''
We learned that one FAG subsidiary sold to one of these resellers from its export price list, rather than from its domestic
price list. Finally, we contacted one of the resellers independently and were told that it only sells in export markets
and that its suppliers were aware of this. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During verification, we inquired of other German producers/exporters about potential sales to ``indirect exporters.''
We did not obtain conclusive evidence that reported home market sales were in fact export sales. However, if we obtain
additional information indicating that other producers reported home market sales that we ultimately conclude
were export sales, we will delete these sales from their home market databases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Tariff Act, we used constructed value as the basis for FMV when there were
no usable sales of such or similar merchandise for comparison. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated CV in accordance with section 773(e) of the Tariff Act. We included the cost of materials, fabrication,
general expenses, profit and packing. To calculate CV we used: (1) actual general expenses, or the statutory minimum
of 10 percent of materials and fabrication, whichever was greater; (2) actual profit or the statutory minimum of 8
percent of materials, fabrication costs and general expenses, whichever was greater; and (3) packing costs for merchandise
exported to the United States. Where appropriate, we made adjustments to CV in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56, for differences
in circumstances of sale. For comparisons to PP sales, we deducted home market direct selling expenses and added U.S.
direct selling expenses. For comparisons to ESP sales, we deducted home market direct selling expenses. We also made
adjustments, where applicable, for home market indirect selling expenses to offset U.S. commissions in PP and ESP
calculations. For comparisons involving ESP transactions, we made further deductions for constructed value for
indirect selling expenses in the home market, capped by the indirect selling expenses incurred on ESP sales in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2).

 duty assessment rate for each class or kind of merchandise based on the ratio of the total value of antidumping duties
calculated for the examined sales made during the POR to the total customs value of the sales used to calculate those
duties. This rate will be assessed uniformly on all entries of that particular importer made during the POR. (This
is equivalent to dividing the total value of antidumping duties, which are calculated by taking the difference between
statutory FMV and statutory USP, by the total statutory USP value of the sales compared, and adjusting the result by
the average difference between USP and customs value for all merchandise examined during the POR.)

particular importer during the POR. The Department will issue appropriate appraisement instructions directly
to the Customs Service upon completion of these reviews.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of these
administrative reviews, as provided by section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) the cash deposit rates for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed companies will be those rates established in the final results of these reviews; (2) for previously reviewed
or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published
for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV
investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period
for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will
continue to be the ``all others'' rate made effective by the final results of the most recent administrative reviews
of the orders (see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping
Duty Order, 58 FR 39729, July 26, 1993). As noted in those previous final results, these rates are the ``all others''
rates from the relevant LTFV investigations. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until
publication of the final results of the next administrative reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate

regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 26, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the final results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping
duty orders on antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand and the United Kingdom. The classes or kinds of merchandise covered
by these reviews are ball bearings and parts thereof, cylindrical roller bearings and parts thereof, and spherical
plain bearings and parts thereof. The reviews covered 41 manufacturers/exporters and the period May 1, 1991 through
April 30, 1992. Based on the correction of ministerial errors, we are amending the final results with respect to Japanese
ball bearings, cylindrical roller bearings and spherical plain bearings sold by one company.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 26, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the final results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty orders on antifriction bearings (other than
tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof (AFBs) from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden,
Thailand and the United Kingdom (58 FR 39729). The classes or kinds of merchandise covered by these reviews were ball
bearings and parts thereof (BBs), cylindrical roller bearings and parts thereof (CRBs), and spherical plain bearings
and parts thereof (SPBs). The reviews covered 41 manufacturers/exporters and the period May 1, 1991 through April
30, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After publication of our final results, we received timely allegations of ministerial errors from Honda Motor Company
concerning the final results for AFBs from Japan sold by Honda. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree with one of these allegations and have made the necessary correction. Specifically, Honda had submitted
two sets of home market data. Although we had intended in our final results to use only certain portions of each of these
datasets, we used the wrong portions in our final results. We have therefore corrected our analysis by using the correct
portions of Honda's submitted home market datasets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 31, 1994, we received a petition filed in proper form by the member companies of the Fresh Garlic Producers
Association (collectively petitioner). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, the petitioner alleges that fresh garlic
from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value
within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports materially
injure, or threaten material injury to, a United States industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner has stated that it has standing to file the petition because it is an interested party, as defined under
section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petition is filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product
subject to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section
771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file a written notification
with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this investigation are all grades of fresh garlic, whether or not chilled or frozen, and include
whole garlic, whole garlic that has been separated into constituent cloves (cracked garlic), and peeled garlic (skin
removed), whether or not packed in any substance. The differences between the grades are based on color, size, sheathing
and level of decay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fresh garlic is used principally as a food product and for seasoning. Fresh garlic, whether or not chilled or frozen,
is currently classifiable under subheadings 0703.20.0000, 0710.80.7060, and 0710.80.9750 of the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes,
our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
United States Price and Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner based United States price (USP) on October 1993 invoices from U.S. importers of the subject merchandise
from the PRC. In calculating USP, petitioner deducted amounts for the following: U.S. duties, ocean freight, marine
insurance, foreign inland freight expenses, brokers' commission, harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing
fees, and commissions charged by the U.S. importers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner alleges that the PRC is a non-market economy (NME) country within the meaning of section 773(c) of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined the PRC to be an NME, within the meaning of section 771(18)(A) of the Act, in previous
cases (see e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Compact Ductile Iron Waterworks Fittings
and Accessories Thereof from the PRC, 58 FR 37908 (July 14, 1993). In accordance with 771(18)(C) of the Act, that determination
continues to apply for purposes of this initiation. In the course of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity
to address this NME determination and provide relevant information and argument on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, because of the extent of central government control in an NME, the Department considers that a single antidumping
margin, should there be one, is appropriate for all exporters from the NME. Only if individual NME exporters are free
of central government ownership and can demonstrate an absence of central governmental control with respect to the
pricing of exports, both in law and in fact, will they be considered eligible for separate, owner-specific deposit
rates. (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Helical Spring Lock Washers from the People's Republic
of China, 58 FR 48833 (September 20, 1993) for a discussion of the information the Department considers appropriate
to warrant calculation of separate rates.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner based foreign market value on the PRC's factors of production for producing the subject merchandise.
To value the factors of production, petitioner used India as a surrogate country. Petitioner argues that India is
a country at a comparable level of economic development as the PRC and India is a significant producer of comparable
merchandise pursuant to section 773(c)(4) of the Act. Further, India's garlic production is labor intensive and
relies on rudimentary agricultural techniques similar to agricultural methods used in the PRC. For purposes of this
initiation, we have accepted India as an appropriate surrogate country selection. There appear to be no other countries
with comparable economies to the PRC that produce the subject merchandise. In addition, the Department has used India
as an appropriate surrogate country selection in other investigations involving merchandise from the PRC. (See
Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sulfanilic Acid from the People's Republic of China (57 FR 29705,
July 6, 1992).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner first attempted to value the factors of production using Indian information. Where this was not possible,
petitioner valued the factors of production using the U.S. industry's costs, where it was determined that this provided
a reasonable basis upon which to value certain factors of production. Petitioner valued the factors of production
of the subject merchandise in the PRC as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For material costs (seed and fertilizer), petitioner relied on Indian factors based on its foreign market
research, using public information whenever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For most labor costs (seed cracking, field preparation, planting, weed control, fertilization, irrigation,
digging, windrowing and harvesting), petitioner relied on an industry expert's estimate of Chinese factors which
was based on the expert's knowledge of the Chinese industry and the expert's own experience with nonmechanized garlic
production, using public information whenever possible. Petitioner valued such labor costs on the basis of Indian
production experience as developed in its foreign market research. For other labor costs related to hauling, sorting,
grading, inspecting, and shrinkage, petitioner relied on the U.S. industry's cost-per-pound for these operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Petitioner added an amount for all other manufacturing costs and related overhead equal to 10 percent of direct
material and labor costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Petitioner added an amount for shrinkage loss of 7 percent of the cost of production, based on U.S. experience.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A), petitioner used the statutory minimum of ten
percent of the cost of production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For profit, petitioner used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of manufacture plus SG&amp;A.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Petitioner added an amount for packing based on the average, actual experience of the U.S. industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on petitioner's calculations, the dumping margins range from 266.73 to 376.67 percent. For purposes of this
initiation, no adjustments were made to petitioner's calculations.

Initiation of Investigation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have examined the petition on fresh garlic and have found that the petition meets the requirements of section 732(b)
of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether imports of fresh
garlic from the PRC are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.

The ITC will determine by March 17, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States
is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of fresh garlic from the PRC. A negative
ITC determination will result in a termination of the investigation; otherwise, the investigation will proceed
according to statutory and regulatory time limits.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 17, 1993, Koyo Seiko Company Ltd. and Koyo Corporation of U.S.A. (Koyo) requested that the Department
of Commerce (the Department) issue a ruling that Koyo's imported forgings, including tower forgings, hot forgings,
and cold forgings, be found outside the scope of the antidumping duty order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof
from Japan (52 FR 37352, October 6, 1987). The Department initiated its scope inquiry on September 28, 1993, and granted
interested parties an opportunity to comment on whether these forgings fall within the scope of the order. We received
comments on November 15, 1993, from the petitioner, the Timken Company, and rebuttal comments from Koyo on November
22, 1993. Due to the significant difficulty presented by this scope inquiry, we have determined that it is appropriate
to issue a preliminary determination, in accordance with the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.29(d)(3) (1993)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Koyo requested the scope ruling in response to a change in the U.S. Customs classification of Koyo's imported forgings.
At the time of the original investigation, Koyo's imported forgings were classified as forgings under the Tariff
Schedules of the United States (TSUS) 606.7340. When the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) replaced the TSUS in 1989
and a specific provision for forgings ceased to exist, Koyo classified its forgings as ``semifinished steel'' under
HTS 7224.90, and later, based on the advice of a Customs port, as ``steel articles'' under HTS 7326.19. Customs recently
examined the subject forgings and informed Koyo that it considers them to be ``parts of tapered roller bearings (TRBs)''
under HTS 8482.99. Customs generally classifies an article as a ``part'' of another article if that is its chief or
principal use. Based on this general principle, Customs determined that under the HTS Koyo's forged rings should
be classified as TRB parts as long as they are chiefly used for incorporation into TRBs. Although Koyo's scope clarification
request was prompted at least in part by the action of Customs, neither classification choices made by producers nor
classification decisions made by Customs determine the scope of antidumping duty orders. Rather, the scope of antidumping
duty orders is determined by the Department at the time of the original investigation and issuance of an order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(i)(1), in analyzing the scope request in this proceeding, the Department took into
account the descriptions of the merchandise contained in the petition, the initial investigation, and the determinations
of the Department and the International Trade Commission (ITC). The regulations provide that if the Department determines
these descriptions are ambiguous, it will further consider the factors provided for under 19 CFR 353.29(i)(2), known
commonly as Diversified Products criteria (see

Koyo makes the forgings at issue from bearing grade steel bar, which is sheared, pierced, and extruded into the shape
of the forging. The forgings are not machined in any way prior to exportation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We note that the term ``forgings'' covers a broad spectrum of products. The Summaries of Trade and Tariff Information
(Schedule 6, Volume 4) identifies two basic types of forgings in its description of the product. Open-die forgings
are large shapes produced by hammering or pressing heated ingots, blooms, billets, slabs, or bars on regulation press-and-hammer
forging equipment with dies that are flat or slightly shaped. Closed-die or drop forgings are small- or medium-size
shapes forged by using dies accurately formed to the size and shape of the desired finished product. Open-die forgings
require machining to acquire the desired dimensions of the finished product. Closed-die forgings require little
or no subsequent machining and are generally considered parts for import classification purposes. The forgings
at issue have not been categorized as either open-die or closed-die forgings.

The Language of the Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original petition describes the subject merchandise as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise covered by this petition is all tapered roller bearings, tapered rollers and other parts thereof
(both finished and unfinished) including, but not limited to, single-row, multiple-row (e.g., two-, four-), and
thrust bearings and self-contained bearing packages (generally pre-set, pre-sealed, and pre-greased), but only
to the extent that such merchandise is not presently covered by an outstanding antidumping duty order or finding in
the United States.

In the petition, Timken stressed that it had identified TSUS numbers to the best of its ability, but that it did not intend
that products under other classification numbers be excluded from the scope if they fell within the description of
the product in the petition. Timken argues that the language of the petition unambiguously includes Koyo's forgings,
since the petition requested coverage for all unfinished TRB parts not included in the A&hyph;588&hyph;054 finding
which covers TRBs four inches or less in outside diameter. Timken takes the position that the instant forgings fall
under the category of unfinished parts and they should properly have been classified that way. The fact that they were
not named specifically in the petition does not imply that Timken did not intend to include them. Timken states that
it was impossible for it to name each item that might be considered a TRB part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Koyo, however, claims that since the petition never mentioned forgings, they were not included. In its ruling request
Koyo argues that forgings are outside the scope of the order because they are ``precursor materials'' that have not
yet begun the manufacturing process. Koyo claims that including forgings would be tantamount to including bearing
grade steel in the scope of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's position is that the petition clearly includes unfinished TRB parts in its scope. However, the language
in the petition is ambiguous with respect to whether forgings are considered unfinished parts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by the preliminary and final determinations and the order as it was published in 1987 are ``tapered
roller bearings and parts thereof, currently classified under Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) item
numbers 680.30 and 680.39; flange, take-up cartridge, and hanger units incorporating tapered roller bearings,
currently classified under TSUS item number 661.10; and tapered roller housings (except pillow blocks) incorporating
tapered rollers, with or without spindles, whether or not for automotive use, and currently classified under TSUS
item number 692.32 or elsewhere in the TSUS. Products subject to the outstanding antidumping duty order covering
certain tapered roller bearings from Japan (T.D. 76&hyph;227, 41 FR 34974) were not included within the scope of this
investigation'' (see Antidumping Duty Order: Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished,
from Japan, 52 FR 37352, October 6, 1987). At issue is whether forgings should be considered unfinished parts within
the scope of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Timken claims that at the time of the order Koyo's imported forgings should have properly been classified as TRB parts,
and that they are clearly included within the scope of the order. Koyo argues that the language of the order unambiguously
excludes forgings, since at the time of the investigation Koyo was importing forgings under TSUS 606.7340 as ``non-machined
steel forgings'', a provision not mentioned in the order. Koyo clearly stated in each of the first three administrative
reviews that it considered its imported forgings to be outside the scope of the order, and neither the Department nor
the petitioner objected. Therefore, Koyo argues that forgings have been considered outside the scope since the order
was published.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's position is that, absent the rare case in which there is no narrative description of the subject merchandise,
any TSUS or HTS numbers mentioned in the scope of an order are for reference only, and do not limit the scope in any way.
The Department's position in this respect is supported by the fact that the scope description for each of the administrative
reviews has contained a statement to the effect that the Customs classification numbers are provided for reference
purposes only. However, the language used in the order to describe the products is ambiguous with respect to forgings,
since forgings are not mentioned and there is no explicit indication of what products are included as unfinished parts.
Moreover, while Koyo stated in its review responses that it did not report forgings, it is not apparent from these statements
the form the imports took. As was described earlier, the term ``forgings'' covers a wide range of products. The question
this scope inquiry poses for the Department is whether the instant forgings are advanced to the point that the Department
considers them TRB parts.

The ITC's Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The International Trade Commission's (ITC) questionnaires in the investigation defined unfinished parts as ``*&blank;*&blank;*
those that have been shaped sufficiently that they may be used only in the manufacture of tapered roller bearings.''
(p. 5). Likewise, the ITC considered whether to treat unfinished parts as separate like products in its final determination.
It rejected Koyo's request to consider each of the following groups as discrete like products: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. ``Precursor materials'' (i.e., unfinished forged rings) and ``finished bulk parts'' (i.e., rollers and cages)
of tapered roller bearings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Unfinished tapered roller bearing components (i.e._unfinished outer rings and inner rings); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Finished tapered roller bearings.

(Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, and Certain Housings Incorporating Tapered Rollers, from Japan, Inv.
No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;343 (Final), USITC Pub 2020, September 1987, p. 5). The ITC reasoned that all parts are destined
to become complete, finished TRBs and that neither finished nor unfinished parts have commercial value except as
components of TRBs. To the extent that the ITC considered the items in this list a single like product, this statement
suggests that the ITC considered forged rings to be unfinished parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ITC also states in its final determination that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Unfinished bearing components are the cones, cups, and rollers that have been green machined and heat treated, but
that require final finishing *&blank;*&blank;* Green machining is an industry term that relates to the machining
operations performed on the raw materials prior to heat treatment for cups, cones, and rollers. (p. A&hyph;8) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
However, Timken points out that the ITC was discussing cups and cones made from tubing rather than forgings, and argues
that the ITC's view that green machining is the first stage in the production process applies only to tubing. Timken
claims that, in the bar-based manufacturing process Koyo uses, the first step in production is forging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is consistent with an ITC footnote (p. A&hyph;8) that the forging process is used instead of green machining,
indicating that at least some of the green machining necessary on rings cut from tube steel is not necessary on forgings.
Although the ITC considered green machining to be the turning point in Timken's tube-based production process, the
distinction is blurred when forgings are used. Since forging can accomplish some of the same results as green machining,
the ITC's description of the production process does not necessarily imply that forged rings are outside the scope
of the order.

Diversified Products Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While stages of production can be helpful in determining when raw material becomes an unfinished part, the descriptions
of the merchandise in the petition and the Department's determinations are ambiguous with respect to the question
of whether these forgings are unfinished parts. The ITC's final determination, though not perfectly clear, points
toward the conclusion that forgings are within the scope of the order. However, because there is some ambiguity, the
Department considered it appropriate to analyze the Diversified Products criteria. The four additional criteria
the Department considered in determining if forgings are within the order are listed at 19 CFR 353.29(i)(2): (1) the
physical characteristics of the product; (2) the expectations of the ultimate purchasers; (3) the ultimate use of
the product; and (4) the channels of trade.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Physical Characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Timken points out that forgings are similar in size and shape to finished cups and cones. However, Koyo argues that
there are dramatic differences between forgings and finished cups and cones. Some forgings are split in two to form
both the cup and the cone. In the manufacturing steps that take place during the turning process, between 24% and 30%
of the steel is removed from a forging, resulting in a green machined ring with the specific dimensions and tolerance
of the finished cup or cone, or inner and outer raceways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Koyo argues further that the forged rings are most similar to steel tube rings, which undergo the same processes (green
machining, heat treatment, polishing, and grinding) before becoming a finished TRB part. Koyo states that ``both
rings cut from tube and forged rings are intermediate donut-shaped pieces of steel that are first produced from steel
bar and later further processed into parts for bearings'' (Koyo's letter to the Department, November 22, 1993, p.4).
Both parties agree that rings cut from tube are outside the scope of the order, as indicated by Koyo's statement to that
effect on page 24 of its letter and Timken's reference to rings cut from tube as raw material (p.23). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Timken points out that the forgings in question are a much more processed product than rings cut from tube
steel. Forged rings have the approximate shapes of the cups and cones that they will be turned into. Indeed, forging
gives them much of the definition that green machining would otherwise give. As a result, the forgings are effectively
dedicated to use as TRB parts. Conversely, rings cut from tube steel bear little resemblance to cups or cones. Tube
rings lose 50% to 75% of the weight of the ring during green machining, and can only be considered TRB parts after this
process takes place. Given the advanced shape that forging gives the components, and the consequent reduction in
green machining, the green machining process does not appear determinative in this case. Rather, it is the advanced
physical characteristics of the component forgings that are definitive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department preliminarily determines that forged rings are more processed than rings from tube stock, and, as
such, are physically distinct from rings cut from tube steel. While some final machining is necessary, the forging
process used in this case effectively transforms the metal input into a product sufficiently advanced in state that
it is essentially a TRB component. Consequently, an examination of physical characteristics indicates that forgings
are included in the scope of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Channels of Trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The forgings at issue are either produced by Koyo or purchased from steel forgers and sold by Koyo to AKBMC, its related
subsidiary. Forgings move through the same channel of trade as unfinished parts, namely, to bearings producers for
incorporation into tapered roller or antifriction bearings. Therefore, the Department preliminarily determines
that the channels of trade criterion indicates that forgings are within the scope of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Expectations of the Ultimate Purchaser 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The forgings in question are imported into the United States for use in the production of TRBs. Timken points out that
these forgings have undergone initial processing which renders them dedicated to use in a limited range of part numbers.
Timken notes that the bearings producers who purchase these forgings have no expected use other than the production
of finished bearings. Koyo submits, however, that finding forgings to be within the scope of the order based on the
expectation criterion is comparable to concluding that bearing grade steel is also within the scope, since it too
is imported for use in production of TRBs and has almost no alternative uses. Koyo argues further that rings cut from
tube steel, which are outside the scope, are also limited to use in a specific range of models.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department notes that although the expectations of the purchasers of bearing grade steel and of rings cut from
tube steel are the same as those of purchasers of in-scope TRB parts, no one argues that bearing grade steel or rings
cut from tube are steel are covered by the order. Moreover, bearing steel might be destined for bearing-related production
but it has not been advanced to the point of dedicating it to a TRB component, finished or unfinished. By the same token,
it is also possible that some rings cut from tube steel may not necessarily be intended for use in TRBs. However, the
forgings in question have been advanced to the point that some use other than a TRB component is highly unlikely. Because
the expectation of the parties importing the instant forgings is to make TRBs, the Department's position is that this
criterion indicates that forgings are within the scope of the order.

Timken points out that forgings are more dedicated to use in TRBs than rings cut from tube steel, since these forgings
more closely approximate the dimensions of the finished cup or cone and do not require as extensive a turning process
as steel tube rings. Koyo contends that a ring cut from steel tube is as dedicated to use in TRBs as a forging is, because
both are made from bearing grade steel, which Koyo claims is too expensive to be used for other purposes. Furthermore,
Koyo argues, a steel tube ring and these forgings are equally limited in the range of bearings for which they can be used.
However, Koyo uses the overwhelming portion of its imported forgings in the production of TRBs. Koyo suggests that
it is possible to use some of the forgings to make both TRB and ball bearing parts (Koyo submitted an example of a ball
bearing and a TRB that have inner rings made from the same forged ring), and it is theoretically possible for the manufacturer
to use a forging originally intended for use in a TRB to produce a ball bearing instead, if production needs change after
importation. In practice, this possibility is seldom realized because it is not cost efficient to create a forging
with multiple uses. Forgings are used to limit the amount of machining that is necessary. The very concept of forging
embodies shaping a blank to the degree that it appears dedicated to one product.

The Department preliminarily determines that since the instant forgings appear dedicated to the production of TRBs,
these forgings are essentially parts of TRBs. Therefore, the ultimate use criterion indicates that these forgings
are within the scope of the order.

Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on our analysis of the comments provided by interested parties on the language of the petition and the determinations
of the ITC and the Department, and on the physical characteristics, channels of trade, expectations of the ultimate
purchasers, and the ultimate use of the product, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(i), we preliminarily determine
that such forgings are the same class or kind of merchandise as unfinished TRB parts, and therefore are within the scope
of the order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof from Japan. The Department preliminarily determines these
forgings to be within the scope based on the totality of the facts presented above and especially for the following
reasons: (1) the ITC clearly includes precursor materials such as forgings within its definition of like product;
(2) the physical characteristics, channels of trade, ultimate use of forgings, and expectations of ultimate purchasers
indicate that such forgings are within the scope of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We invite interested parties to comment on this preliminary determination no later than March 18, 1994. Rebuttal
comments are due no later than March 25, 1994. The Department will consider such comments in reaching its final determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This preliminary scope ruling is in accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(d)(3).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance
award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) to Urban Energy and Transportation Corporation
(UETC) under Cooperative Agreement Number DE&hyph;FC01&hyph;94EW54065. Estimated total funding in the amount
of $15,000,000 will be provided to obtain local officials' participation and expertise in transportation activities
including collection and dissemination of information, conducting regional and national workshops, providing
technical assistance, and identification and analyses of issues related to transportation of hazardous materials
through large urban areas. This activity will promote better understanding of local views concerning clean-up technologies,
emergency management and training issues, and transportation operations and outreach. As a result, this will enable
DOE to develop programs that will better meet those local needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) that UETC will provide continued
activity which is necessary to the satisfactory completion of an activity presently being funded by DOE, and for which
competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed effort is to establish and maintain networks of senior decision-makers from local communities who are
responsible for or concerned about technology development, transportation, and emergency issues associated with
energy-related facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
UETC has a vast array of techniques to accomplish the objectives of the proposed project, including professional
techniques in structured meeting design and facilitation, information dissemination through printed products
such as newsletters and electronic media, opinion surveys, planning and program evaluation, and public and institutional
involvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The anticipated period of performance is 60 months from the effective date of award.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The subject study represents a review and evaluation of readily available pertinent technical reports which were
discussed among the participating agencies during the course of the preparation of the study from October to December
1992. After reviewing the hazards posed by plutonium, applicable transportation safety and physical protection
regulations, pertinent research and experience, and contingency plans, the agencies participating in this study
conclude that plutonium can be shipped safely by sea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 102&hyph;486 also requires the preparation and submittal to Congress of an Implementation Plan that describes
the plan for implementing the recommendations contained in the study. The Implementation Plan must be submitted
to Congress and made available for public viewing 90 days after issuance of the study. Subsequent to enactment of the
legislation calling for this study and Implementation Plan, and subsequent to preparation of the study, several
individual members of Congress have raised additional concerns relating to the shipment of radioactive materials
by sea. These concerns include the safety of shipment of other material proposed to be shipped (e.g., glassified high-level
nuclear waste and mixed oxide fuel), as well as the need to evaluate risk assessment elements. These elements are shipping
routes, adequacy of the revised International Maritime Organization code for radioactive shipments, the consequences
and probability of the ``maximum credible accident'' in shipping by sea, and the examination of threats of sabotage
and terrorism. The participating Federal agencies will address these additional concerns in the Implementation
Plan to the extent that they relate to the recommendations in the study. Where certain issues raised do not fall within
the framework of the study and Implementation Plan, the agencies will ensure that they are addressed through direct
communication with the members of Congress who raised them.

Florida Power requests that the Commission waive the 60 day minimum notice requirement of the Federal Power Act to
achieve the March 2, 1994 effective date for the rate changes proposed for that date for (1) the parties to the pre-filing
settlement agreement, (2) customers not parties to the pre-filing settlement agreement but consenting to the pre-filing
settlement procedures and (3) any other customers who do not oppose the March 2, 1994 requested effective date. Florida
Power further requests that the Commission establish an effective date of April 9, 1994, 60 days from the date of the
filing, for any customers who oppose the March 2, 1994 effective date. The Company further requests that the rate increases
proposed for March 2, 1994, April 9, 1994, if applicable, and May 1, 1994 be permitted to become effective without suspension
or, if suspended, that the suspension be for the minimum one day period.

Take notice that on February 9, 1994, Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern), 1111 South 103rd Street, Omaha, Nebraska
68124&hyph;1000 filed an application pursuant to sections 7 (b) and (c) of the Natural Gas Act for: (a) A certificate
of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of approximately 11.95 miles of
various size mainline and branchline looping pipeline; and (b) permission and approval to abandon and a certificate
of public convenience and necessity for certain facilities for the modification of nine town border stations (TBS)
in the State of Minnesota in order to expand pipeline capacity to provide incremental firm transportation service
to Minnegasco, a Division of Arkla, Inc. (Minnegasco) and Great Plains Natural Gas Company (Great Plains), all as
more fully set forth in the application, which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern proposes to construct the following facilities in order to provide firm transportation service Minnegasco
and Great Plains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Approximately 2.82 miles of 30-inch pipeline at the end of the existing D-Line in a northerly direction parallel
to Northern's existing mainline in Steele County, Minnesota. A tie-in to the B and C-Lines would be made at the end of
the D-Line extension and the existing D to C regulator setting would be moved to the new tie-over point; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Approximately 1.28 miles of 30-inch pipeline as an extension of Northern's C-Line parallel to Northern's existing
mainline and ending with a tap on the B-Line in Washington County, Minnesota; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Approximately 7.85 miles of 8-inch pipeline loop on the Alexandria Branchline in a westerly direction in Morrison
County, Minnesota to accommodate a portion of the increased requirements for Minnegasco; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern proposes to modify the Clarkfield No. 1 TBS serving Great Plains and 8 TBS' serving Minnegasco as follows:

1; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Replace existing regulator valve trim at Mound No. 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern estimates the cost of these facilities to be $6,065,000 which would be financed with internally generated
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern proposes to construct the facilities to provide additional capacity on Northern's mainline north between
its Owatonna Compressor Station (Owatonna) in Steele County, Minnesota and its North Branch Compressor Station
in Chicago County, Minnesota to serve additional market requirements of 19,788 Mcf of natural gas per day requested
by Minnegasco and Great Plains during a thirty day open season from November 10, 1993 to December 9, 1993. Northern
states that the Alexandria Branchline loop is required to meet Minnegasco's increased requirements served from
the branchline. Northern states that the mainline facilities would increase the capacity of the mainline north of
Owatonna by 19,288 Mcf of natural gas per day and is required for the 1994&hyph;95 heating season. The balance would
be transported through existing capacity, it is indicated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on February 14, 1994, Chandeleur Pipe Line Company (Chandeleur), P.O. Box 740339, New Orleans, LA
70174, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;233&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act
for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the increase of maximum operating pressures and
total system maximum capacity of its pipeline, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the
Commission and open to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chandeleur states that it consists of a 79.9 mile 12-inch mainline, a parallel 82.3 mile 16-inch mainline (which loops
the 12-inch line) and an 11.3 mile 12-inch lateral gas supply pipeline. The maximum operating pressure of the 12-inch
mainline is 1100 psig. The maximum operating pressure of the 16-inch mainline 1000 psig. The maximum operating pressure
of the 12-inch lateral is 1318 psig. The current authorized system capacity is 205,000 Mcf per day, with maximum capacity
of 240,000 Mcf per day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Chandeleur requests authorization to increase the maximum operating pressures of both its 12-inch
and 16-inch mainlines to 1200 psig. Chandeleur states that it has recently completed a new interconnection with Texas
Eastern Transmission Corporation's (``TETCO'') 24-inch mainline in offshore Louisiana in OCS Breton Sound Block
42 for the purpose of allowing Chandeleur's shippers to transport gas into TETCO's system, thereby increasing the
shippers' delivery options. Chandeleur states that TETCO's maximum operating pressure is 1200 psig. To allow delivery
of natural gas from Chandeleur into TETCO's 24-inch mainline when TETCO is operating at maximum pressure, Chandeleur
states that its maximum operating pressure must match TETCO's and therefore must be increased to 1200 psig.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chandeleur states that the requested increase in pressure to 1200 psig is within maximum allowable operating pressures
for Chandeleur's pipeline as established by the Department of Transportation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chandeleur states that the requested increase in operating pressure and maximum capacity will allow its current
and future shippers to increase the amount of gas they can transport to existing markets and to new markets which are
not now economically accessible through Chandeleur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before March 3,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 18 CFR
385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will
be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties
to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or participate as a party in any hearing therein
must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and
Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene

I. EPAct's IRP Reporting Requirements of DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) contains several requirements of DOE to report to the President and Congress
on the status and likely impacts of electric and gas IRP development across the nation. These IRP-related reporting
requirements can be found in EPAct, Title I_Energy Efficiency, Subtitle B_Utilities, Sections 111(e) and 115(e).
The purpose of this notice is to obtain information relevant to the IRP evaluation and small business impact reporting
requirements by soliciting the opinions of IRP stakeholders concerning the impact of IRP on electricity costs to
consumers, reliability of electric service, dependence on particular energy sources, and small businesses engaged
in providing energy services. In the near-term, DOE must satisfy these EPAct requirements which call for DOE to prepare
this report to the President and Congress within two years of EPAct's enactment. The report must contain, among other
IRP-related items, an evaluation which determines:

&bull;Whether and to what extent IRP (electric only) is likely to result in_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Higher or lower electricity costs to an electric utility's ultimate consumers or to classes or groups of such consumers;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

b. Enhanced or reduced reliability of electric service; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Increased or decreased dependence on particular energy resources; as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The competitive impact of implementation of energy conservation, energy efficiency, and other DSM programs
by utilities (electric and gas) on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation, or servicing
of similar energy conservation, energy efficiency, or other DSM measures; and whether any unfair, deceptive, or
predatory acts exist, or are likely to exist, from implementation of such programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The DOE IRP Program will also use responses to this request for providing insight into the direction of the Program's
longer-term research agenda related to assessing the national impacts of IRP. Responses to this request will be analyzed
and reported by the staff of DOE's Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) Program, which is under the auspices of the Office
of Utility Technologies which is under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Energy. This summary will characterize what various groups believe to be the likely impacts of electric IRP on the
nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Purpose of Request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The overall legislative intent of Subsection 111 of EPAct is to promote energy efficiency, in particular by encouraging
utilities and States to adopt the planning principles of IRP. The legislative intent of the requirements to report
the impact of IRP on electricity costs to consumers, reliability of electric service, and dependence on particular
energy resources is to assess the likely results of IRP implementation against the intended purpose and goals of EPAct's
IRP-related provisions. It is also the intent of the provision to determine the competitive impacts of the energy
conservation, energy efficiency, and other demand-side management programs of electric and gas utilities on small
businesses to ensure that State regulatory commissions are considering the impact which expanded DSM programs may
have on small businesses already engaged in similar activities, and are implementing measures to assure that utility
actions will not provide utilities with an unfair competitive advantage over such small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DOE's IRP Program is responsible for this report. The program views the Federal role in IRP development as a collector
of important data, a conduit of the lessons learned by experienced IRP practitioners to new IRP adopters, a developer
of new tools and data bases and monitorer of the outcomes of IRP processes around the country. Among the priorities
in this effort is the fulfillment of these EPAct reporting requirements concerning the likely impacts of IRP on the
nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Submitting this report to the President and Congress will be a component of a continuing effort by DOE's IRP Program
to monitor and evaluate the impact of IRP on the nation's States, utilities and consumers. The IRP Program views as
part of its role to think critically about IRP and its expected benefits. Because DOE implements national energy policies
that emphasize IRP as a potential solution to some of the problems affecting the nation's utility energy services,
an assessment as to whether and to what extent IRP is providing overall benefit to the nation, as it is practiced, is
a necessary and important DOE responsibility.

III. Definitions of IRP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
To ensure that all respondents to this notice have a common understanding of DOE's perspective on the role of IRP in
utility planning, DOE offers the following to define IRP's scope and parameters and to describe the characteristics
which distinguish IRP from traditional planning approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Traditional planning techniques used by utilities once focus only on investing in supply-side resources to satisfy
customers' needs. A distinguishing factor of the IRP process is that it includes both supply- and demand-side resources
in meeting demands for utility energy services. According to Section 111 of EPAct, IRP for electric utility service
is: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
A planning and selection process for new energy resources that evaluates the full range of alternatives, including
new generating capacity, power purchases, energy conservation and efficiency, cogeneration and district heating
and cooling applications, and renewable energy resources, in order to provide adequate and reliable service to its
customers at the lowest system cost.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In addition to promoting a mix of alternative resources, IRP infuses the interests of all stakeholders: Utilities,
ratepayers, regulators, stockholders, and interest groups. The following explanation of IRP, also taken from EPAct
Section 111, reflects the idea that IRP is a process that evaluates the issues raised by different stakeholders. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
The Process [will] take into account necessary features for system operation, such as diversity, reliability, dispatchability,
and other factors of risk; [will] take into account the ability to verify energy savings achieved through energy conservation
and efficiency and the projected durability of such savings measured over time; [and will] treat demand and supply
resources on a consistent and integrated basis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The DOE approach to IRP for utility and State energy planning is to treat all options_supply, storage, delivery, and
demand-side_on a consistent basis using a systems approach without preconceptions or bias for or against any particular
option, fuel type, or form of ownership. The following characteristics distinguish IRP from traditional planning
techniques. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
1. IRP examines the full range of energy and capacity resources including demand-side management programs, transmission
and distribution systems, and non-traditional supply alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. IRP gives consideration to the full range of economic, environmental, social, and technological factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. IRP facilitates public involvement in utility planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. IRP facilitates consideration of the risks and uncertainties posed by different resource portfolios and by external
factors such as fluctuations in energy prices and economic conditions.

 Title II of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.), provides that
no new baseload electric powerplant may be constructed or operated without the capability to use coal or another alternate
fuel as a primary energy source. In order to meet the requirement of coal capability, the owner or operator of such facilities
proposing to use natural gas or petroleum as its primary energy source shall certify, pursuant to FUA section 201(d),
to the Secretary of Energy prior to construction, or prior to operation as a base load powerplant, that such powerplant
has the capability to use coal or another alternate fuel. Such certification establishes compliance with section
201(a) on the day it is filed with the Secretary. The Secretary is required to publish a notice in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Effective February 28, 1994, the EPA is announcing the availability of a new edition of its National Directory of AHERA
Accredited Courses (NDAAC). This publication, updated quarterly, provides information to the public about training
providers and courses approved for accreditation purposes pursuant to the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act
(AHERA). As a nationwide listing of approved asbestos training programs and courses, the NDAAC has replaced the similar
listing which was formerly published quarterly by EPA in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The February 28, 1994, directory, which supersedes the version released on November 30, 1993, may be ordered through
the NDAAC Clearinghouse along with a variety of related reports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA), contractors
who prepare management plans for schools, inspect for asbestos in schools or public and commercial buildings, or
design or conduct response actions with respect to friable asbestos-containing materials in schools or public and
commercial buildings, are required to obtain accreditation by completing prescribed training requirements. EPA
therefore maintains a current national listing of AHERA-accredited courses and approved training providers so
that this information will be readily available to assist the public in accessing these training programs and obtaining
the necessary accreditation. The information is also maintained so that the Agency and approved state accreditation
and licensing programs will have a reliable means of identifying and verifying the approval status of training courses
and organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Previously, EPA had published this listing in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on a quarterly basis. The last 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 listing required by law was published on August 30, 1991. EPA recognized the need to continue publication of this document
even though the legislative mandate had expired. The NDAAC fulfills the public need for this information while at
the same time, it reduces EPA cost and improves the service's capabilities.

Description:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) will conduct A Descriptive Study of the Head Start Health
Component. The study, conducted in 80 Head Start centers around the country, will include interviews with 1200 parents
who have a 4-year-old child in Head Start, with a review of the Head Start health records of these children. There will
also be interviews with the key Head Start staff responsible for administration and implementation of the Health
Component.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During Phase I of the study, a Technical Advisory Panel, consisting of experts in the four health domains, assisted
in developing the sampling, data collection and analysis plans, as well as the data collection instruments. In Phase
II, the research team will collect health screening, examination, referral, treatment and services data for 15 randomly
selected four-year-old children at each of the 80 participating Head Start centers, also selected at random from
around the country. All data collection must be completed prior to the end of the Head Start academic year. These data
will be analyzed to provide a description of how this nationwide sample of programs is implementing the Head Start
Health Component.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), as amended by
the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), requires that ATSDR and the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) annually revise the Priority List of Hazardous Substances to include additional substances most commonly
found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL). This announcement provides notice that the agencies
have developed and are making available a revised CERCLA Priority List of 275 Hazardous Substances, based on the most
recent information available to ATSDR and EPA. This revised priority list includes newly listed substances which
have been determined to pose the most significant potential threat to human health at or around NPL hazardous waste
sites. Each substance on the priority list is a candidate to become the subject of a toxicological profile prepared
by ATSDR and subsequent identification of priority data needs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 CERCLA establishes certain requirements for ATSDR and EPA with regard to hazardous substances which are most commonly
found at facilities on the CERCLA NPL. Section 104(i)(2) of CERCLA, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(2)), requires that
the two agencies prepare a list, in order of priority, of at least 100 hazardous substances that are most commonly found
at facilities on the NPL and which, in their sole discretion, are determined to pose the most significant potential
threat to human health (see 52 FR 12866, April 17, 1987). CERCLA also requires the agencies to revise the priority list
to include 100 or more additional hazardous substances (see 53 FR 41280, October 20, 1988), and to include at least
25 additional hazardous substances in each of the three successive years following the 1988 revision (see 54 FR 43619,
October 26, 1989; 55 FR 42067, October 17, 1990; 56 FR 52166, October 17, 1991). CERCLA also requires that ATSDR and
EPA shall, not less often than once every year thereafter, revise the list to include additional hazardous substances
which are determined to pose the most significant potential threat to human health. Each substance on the CERCLA priority
list of hazardous substances is a candidate to become the subject of a toxicological profile prepared by ATSDR and
the subsequent identification of priority data needs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The previous priority lists of hazardous substances were based on the most comprehensive and relevant information
available when the lists were developed. More comprehensive sources of information on the frequency of occurrence
and the potential for human exposure of substances at NPL sites became available for use in the 1991 priority list with
the development of ATSDR's HazDat database; additional information from HazDat has become available for this year's
listing activity. In the initial listing activities (1987&hyph;1990), new substances were added to the end of the
list, without a comparative reranking. A notice announcing the intention of ATSDR and EPA to revise and rerank the
priority list of hazardous substances was published on June 27, 1991 (56 FR 29485). In this year's listing activity,
as in the previous two years, new candidate substances (substances found at three or more NPL sites) were assigned
a toxicity/environmental score (TES) using the EPA Reportable Quantity methodology, and were added to the pool of
substances previously considered for the annual list. All substances were then evaluated together for consideration
on the priority list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approach used to generate the 1991 revised priority list was summarized in the ``Revised Priority List of Hazardous
Substances'' (56 FR 52166, October 17, 1991). Using the same approach, and the same algorithm this year, over 700 candidate
substances have been ranked to create the current list of 275 substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional information used in this year's listing activity was entered into ATSDR's HazDat database since the
development of the 1992 Priority List of Hazardous Substances. As with other site-specific information used in the
listing activity, this information has been collected from ATSDR Public Health Assessments and from site file data
packages used in the development of Public Health Assessments. The new information includes more recent NPL frequency
of occurrence data, additional concentration data, and more information on exposure or potential exposure to substances
present at NPL sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time the list includes 275 substances which ATSDR and EPA have determined to pose the most significant potential
threat to human health based on the criteria of CERCLA section 104(i)(2) (42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(2)). All candidate substances
have been analyzed and ranked with the current algorithm, and may become the subject of toxicological profiles in
the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of approximately 12,800 contaminant data records (for air, water and soil) to the HazDat database since
October 1992 has allowed the agencies to better assess the potential for human exposure to substances at NPL hazardous
waste sites. With this additional data, 10 new candidate substances have been added to the list, and 13 substances
under consideration last year have moved onto the list. Accordingly, 23 substances have been replaced on the list
of the 275 substances. These changes in the order of substances appearing on the CERCLA priority list of hazardous
substances will be reflected in the program activities which rely on the list for future direction. For example, Dicofol
moved up significantly (to number 107) on the 1993 list when compared to last year's list. As a result it will be included
in the pool of substances that may become the subject of new toxicological profiles in the next fiscal year. Similarly,
alpha-Endosulfan (number 33) moved well into the range of those substances to be considered for the development of
updated toxicological profiles (CERCLA also requires ATSDR to evaluate new information on profiled substances
for potential revision every three years). These changes reflect the dynamic nature of scientific data on substances
present at NPL (and other) hazardous waste sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This annual evaluation activity and announcement of a revised priority list of hazardous substances fulfills the
conditions of CERCLA section 104(i), as amended, which requires ATSDR and EPA to revise the list yearly to include
additional hazardous substances. The agencies intend to revise the list of hazardous substances annually thereafter
to reflect changes and improvements in data collection and availability. Additional information on the methodology
used in the development of the CERCLA Priority List of Hazardous Substances can be found in the

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a videoconferencing facility. The videoconferencing
facility was established to improve communications between the agency and interested parties. The facility will
be used for a variety of purposes, including meetings, with the public and regulated industries, internal FDA meetings,
and training. The facility will be used to supplement face-to-face meetings and allow broader participation in discussions
with FDA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA has established a videoconferencing facility for general use by FDA. The facility, which became operational
on June 1, 1993, is located in rm. 13B&hyph;37 in the Parklawn Bldg., 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. The facility
has a capacity for 25 to 30 people and can be used to conduct videoconferences with FDA. The establishment of the facility
culminates a 3-year project by FDA and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association to improve communications
between the agency and interested parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency does not intend to restrict the use of the videoconferencing facility to any specific purpose. The facility
can be used to expedite meetings with the public and regulated industries, or to facilitate training and internal
FDA meetings. In addition to improving communications, FDA believes that the facility may even shorten FDA review
times for applications because the facility can be used to facilitate prompt resolution of specific issues. Videoconferencing
will also facilitate broader participation by industry staff in FDA meetings and make meetings more productive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Policies and Procedures for Use
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has established videoconferencing as an optional means of communicating with FDA. The decision on whether to
conduct a face-to-face meeting or videoconference, or a combination of meetings and videoconferences, must be agreed
to by both the agency and the interested party. Use of the videoconferencing facility is not intended to limit, in any
way, either face-to-face, telephone, written, or any other type of interaction involving FDA personnel. In fact,
videoconferences can be used to supplement face-to-face meetings and enable more persons outside the Rockville,
MD area to participate in discussions with FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All existing confidentiality rules that apply to face-to-face meetings also apply to videoconferences. The transmission
signal between the videoconferencing sites is conducted through cables and is scrambled to provide security. Ordinarily,
there will be no videotaping of videoconferences, but videotaping may be permitted if all parties agree to videotaping
before the videoconference is held. FDA will not permit videoconferences to be broadcasted, however, because some
information presented at such meetings may be confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All current FDA procedures for conducting meetings will apply to videoconferences. Because some participants may
not always be in view of the camera, FDA recommends that each videoconference begin by introducing or identifying
all participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA will schedule videoconferences in response to a specific request. The request should be made to the contact person
listed above. FDA recommends that parties request a videoconference at least several weeks in advance, and there
is no time limit on how far in advance a videoconference may be scheduled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scheduling will be done on a first-come, first-served basis. FDA will consider the geographical location of the parties
when scheduling a videoconference; thus, for example, FDA will schedule morning meetings with parties in the Eastern
United States, and schedule afternoon meetings with parties in the Western United States. The agency does not intend
to establish prereserved blocks of time for parties in the Western United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once a videoconference has been scheduled, the agency will not reschedule the videoconference except in emergencies.
This policy is in consideration of the substantial amount of scheduling and preparation involved in setting up a videoconference.
Additionally, videoconferencing should be reserved for meetings that are likely to run at least 30 minutes. If a videoconference
extends beyond its scheduled time, the videoconference may be extended, provided the facility is still available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda and all materials planned to be presented during a videoconference should be sent to the Project Management
Officer, Consumer Safety Officer, or appropriate official (in nonindustry-related meetings) at least 14 days before
the scheduled videoconference. The materials will be used as reference or backup material and will help assure high
quality communication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the videoconferencing facility's first year of operation, FDA will maintain a log on the use of the facility
to determine the demand and variety of uses for the facility and to determine how much use is for internal FDA purposes
or for FDA and nongovernmental entities. In addition, FDA will provide a questionnaire to participants to obtain
their opinions on the value of the videoconferencing facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons interested in obtaining information concerning the policies and procedures, which are continuing to evolve
at this time, for using FDA's videoconferencing facility, as well as a listing of public videoconferencing rooms,
should notify the contact person listed above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The IRTA Program is designed to provide opportunities for developmental training and practical research experience
in the laboratories of the NIH. Training fellowships are available to postdoctoral scientists at the beginning stages
of their professional research careers, and to high school, college, graduate and professional (e.g. medical dental,
etc.) school students pursuing studies in academic disciplines related to biomedical research. Candidates must
be U.S. citizens, noncitizen nationals of the United States, or individuals lawfully admitted for permanent residence
in the U.S. Applicants may not be excluded from consideration for the IRTA Program on the basis of race, color, religion,
sex, handicap, age, national origin, political affiliation, or any other nonmerit factor. Subject to the availability
of funds, IRTA Fellowship awards are made on the basis of NIH's assessment of the mutuality of research interests,
the qualifications of the candidates, and their potential to benefit from the training assignment. Recipient are
not Federal employees.

Predoctoral Fellowships are awarded to students enrolled in Ph.D., M.D., D.D.S., D.M.D., D.V.M., or equivalent
degree programs at fully accredited U.S. universities. Predoctoral Fellowships are designed to support a period
of full-time research training in NIH laboratories, undertaken as an integral part of participants' academic program.
Awards are generally granted for the purpose of developing and writing a thesis in an NIH intramural laboratory, although
other academically related training may occasionally be supported. For students pursuing a degree for which a thesis
is not required (e.g., M.D., D.V.M., etc.), a full-time training program in biomedical research will be designed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Students must be admitted to graduate or professional school and be a doctoral degree candidate before they can be
considered. Normally, most students will have completed their first year of graduate course work before beginning
the Program. Written agreement from the school is required. Predoctoral IRTA Fellows are normally expected to devote
full-time to their NIH training assignments. IRTA awards are not intended as grants to support academic training
and Predoctoral IRTA Fellows are normally expected to pay any university tuition, fees, or other costs themselves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Predoctoral awards are made initially for one or two years, and may be renewed in one-year increments. The maximum
duration is normally three years or until students receive their doctoral degree, whichever comes first. In individual
cases, renewals beyond three years may be approved provided the student is making reasonable and acceptable progress
towards obtaining the doctoral degree.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3600&hyph;3619), the Department is authorized to investigate complaints alleging
discrimination in housing. Section 810(f) of the Fair Housing Act requires the Department to refer complaints to
agencies that have ``substantially equivalent'' fair housing standards, as determined and certified by the Department.
The certification standards and procedures are set forth in 24 CFR part 115. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP), the regulations for which are codified in 24 CFR part 111, the Department
may provide assistance to ``substantially equivalent'' State and local agencies. This assistance is designed to
provide support for complaint processing, training, technical assistance, data and information systems, and other
fair housing projects. The regulations in 24 CFR part 111 provide for FHAP funding to be announced through a Notice
of Funding Availability (NOFA) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the regulations in part 111 provide for the announcement of the availability of FHAP funding through a NOFA
(and 24 CFR part 12 also makes note of the NOFA requirement), FHAP is not a competitive program. FHAP funds are not awarded
on the basis of a competition. Accordingly, a waiver of the requirement to make FHAP funding available through a NOFA
was requested and granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the requirements of section 106 of the HUD Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)(g)), the Secretary,
on June 2, 1993, waived the FHAP NOFA requirement set forth in 24 CFR part 12 on the basis that the FHAP is not a competitive
program. The Department intends to amend 24 CFR part 12 to reflect the fact that FHAP is not a competitive program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the requirements of section 102(a)(4)(C) of the HUD Reform Act of 1989, the names and addresses
of the substantially equivalent agencies which received FHAP funds for FY 1992, on a noncompetitive basis, and the
amount of the awards, are set forth in Appendix A to this notice.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishing Federal jurisdictional boundaries for offshore facilities,
including pipelines, became effective on February 3, 1994. The MOU divides the responsibilities associated with
oil-spill prevention and control, response planning, and response equipment inspection for offshore facilities.
The MOU is among the Department of the Interior (DOI), Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coast line marks the boundary that determines which agency is responsible for a facility. The MMS of the DOI is responsible
for offshore facilities, including pipelines but not deepwater ports, located seaward of the coast line. The EPA
is responsible for non-transportation-related offshore facilities located landward of the coast line. The U.S.
Coast Guard and the Research and Special Programs Administration of the DOT will handle transportation-related
offshore facilities, including pipelines, located landward of the coast line.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any exceptions to the MOU will be determined on a facility-specific basis, and the affected parties will be notified.

Executive Order (E.O.) 12777 (56 FR 54757) delegated to DOI, DOT, and EPA various responsibilities identified in
the Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;380). The E.O. 12777 assigned
the responsibilities associated with oil-spill prevention and control, contingency planning, and response equipment
inspection for offshore facilities to DOI. However, section 311(a)(11) of the CWA defines ``offshore facility''
to include facilities of any kind located in, on, or under navigable waters of the United States. By using this definition,
the traditional DOI role of regulating facilities in the Outer Continental Shelf is expanded by E.O. 12777 to include
inland lakes, rivers, streams, and any other inland waters. Without this MOU, as many as four Federal agencies could
have overlapping responsibilities for some coastal facilities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To avoid any confusion caused by the definition of ``offshore facility'', MMS coordinated an effort to establish
jurisdictional boundaries for oil-spill prevention and control, response planning, and response equipment inspection
activities. Pursuant to section 2(i) of E.O. 12777, the Secretary of the Interior redelegated those functions vested
in DOI to give EPA non-transportation-related offshore facilities located landward of the coast line and give DOT
transportation-related offshore facilities landward of the coast line. The divisions agreed to in the MOU (Appendix
A) is more consistent with traditional agency expertise and jurisdiction. This MOU does not include jurisdictional
boundaries for oil-spill financial responsibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) establishes the jurisdictional responsibilities for offshore facilities,
including pipelines, pursuant to section 311 (j)(1)(c), (j)(5), and (j)(6)(A) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended
by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;380). The Secretary of the Department of the Interior (DOI),
Secretary of Department of Transportation (DOT), and Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
agree to the division of responsibilities set forth below for spill prevention and control, response planning, and
equipment inspection activities pursuant to those provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->

Executive Order (E.O.) 12777 (56 FR 54757) delegates to DOI, DOT, and EPA various responsibilities identified in
section 311(j) of the CWA. Sections 2(b)(3), 2(d)(3), and 2(e)(3) of E.O. 12777 assigned to DOI spill prevention and
control, contingency planning, and equipment inspection activities associated with offshore facilities. Section
311(a)(11) defines the term ``offshore facility'' to include facilities of any kind located in, on, or under navigable
waters of the United States. By using this definition, the traditional DOI role of regulating facilities on the Outer
Continental Shelf is expanded by E.O. 12777 to include inland lakes, rivers, streams, and any other inland waters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 2(i) of E.O. 12777, DOI redelegates, and EPA and DOT agree to assume, the functions vested in DOI
by sections 2(b)(3), 2(d)(3), and 2(e)(3) of E.O. 12777 as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this MOU, the term ``coast line'' shall be defined as in the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301(c))
to mean ``the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and
the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To EPA, DOI redelegates responsibility for non-transportation-related offshore facilities located landward
of the coast line.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To DOT, DOI redelegates responsibility for transportation-related facilities, including pipelines, located
landward of the coast line. The DOT retains jurisdiction for deepwater ports and their associated seaward pipelines,
as delegated by E.O. 12777.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The DOI retains jurisdiction over facilities, including pipelines, located seaward of the coast line, except
for deepwater ports and associated seaward pipelines delegated by E.O. 12777 to DOT.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act,
25 U.S.C. 3003(d), of the completion of the inventory of human remains and funerary objects from Hawaii in the control
of the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station, Kaneohe Bay. The remains are curated in the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, Honolulu,
HI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed inventory and assessment of these human remains and funerary objects has been made for the U.S. Marine Corps
by the staff of the Bishop Museum, in consultation with representatives of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hui Mlama I N Kpuna 'O Hawai'i Nei 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. The latter two organizations qualify as Native Hawaiian organizations as defined
in 25 U.S.C. 3001(11).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The human remains and funerary objects represent a minimum of 1582 individuals and 281 funerary objects recovered
from the Mokapu Peninsula, U.S. Marine Corps Air Station, Kaneohe Bay, Island of Oahu, and curated at the Bishop Museum.
The majority of the remains were recovered during archaeological excavations conducted in 1938&hyph;1940 by Gordon
T. Bowles (University of Hawaii) and Kenneth P. Emory (Bishop Museum), and in 1957 by Robert N. Bowen (University of
Hawaii). The rest of the remains were recovered from inadvertent discoveries and archaeological monitoring of construction
activities on the peninsula.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A minimum of 1,544 individuals were recovered from pre-contact (prior to 1778) graves. A number of these individuals
were represented by incomplete sets of skeletal remains, and several of the isolated individuals represented secondarily
deposited incomplete sets of remains removed from their original context. The pre-contact funerary objects included

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Aleurites moluccana) nuts, and the bones of fish, birds, pigs, dogs, and turtles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A minimum of 38 individuals were recovered from post-Contact (after 1778) graves during a construction project in
1975. The post-Contact funerary objects included

 (pendants made of calcite, shell, and whale bone), as well as bone and shell buttons, metal fragments, mirror glass,
bottle fragments, a metal ring, ivory beads, bone and glass, metal nails, and metal parts of a smoking pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the Bishop Museum report of the results of the inventory and assessment, officials of the U.S. Marine Corps
have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be
reasonably traced between these remains and present-day Native Hawaiian organizations. U.S. Marine Corps officials,
based on the Bishop Museum report, determined that no lineal descendants of the human remains could be identified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) and (11) require that the public be provided a 30-day period in which to comment on the routine uses
of a new system; the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which has oversight responsibilities under the Act, requires

By the authority vested in me as Attorney General under section 102(a)(1) of the Brady Handgun Violence Protection

individuals listed in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Violent Felon File. The second inquiry will be
to the Interstate Identification Index, which will furnish automated criminal history records available through
NCIC.

Detroit Edison Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;43 which authorizes
operation of the Fermi 2 Nuclear Plant at steady-state reactor power levels not in excess of 3430 megawatts thermal.
The Fermi 2 facility is a boiling water reactor located at the licensee's site in Monroe County, Michigan. The license
provides, among other things, that it is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph III.A.6.(b) of Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 requires, in part, that if two consecutive periodic Type A tests
fail to meet the applicable acceptable criteria in III.A.5.(b), a Type A test shall be performed at each refueling
shutdown or approximately every 18 months, whichever occurs first, until two consecutive Type A tests meet the acceptance
criteria, after which the normal inspection interval specified in III.D may be resumed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), the NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations (1) which are authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and
security; and (2) where special circumstances are present.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
III
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated May 24, 1993, the licensee requested a one-time exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix
J, III.A.6.(b) identified above, which were in effect due to ``As-Found'' Type A failure in 1989 and 1992. The licensee
has verified that Type C leakage rates were the reason for the ``As-Found'' failures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two ``As-Found'' Type A failures were caused by the addition of Type C penalties. The licensee indicated that to
date all containment deficiencies have been identified during Type C testing and; therefore, it is proposed that
Type C testing be relied upon in lieu of the increased frequency Type A test. Fermi 2 has established stringent LLRT
[local leak rate test] administrative leak rate acceptance criteria on a per valve basis, based on ASME Code guidance,
individual valve test maintenance history, design, function, and service. Test acceptance criteria range from
0.20 scfh [standard cubic feet per hour] to 15.00 scfh. This ensures valve leak tight integrity is maintained from
Type A test to Type A test. The licensee indicated that if valves are repaired when they exceed their individual administrative
acceptance criteria, and corrective modifications or replacement are implemented, the overall containment integrity
will be assured with future integrated leak rate tests (ILRTs) meeting their ``As-Found'' acceptance criteria.
The licensee indicated that the implementation of the proposed Corrective Action Plan and continued Type C leakage
testing provide reasonable assurance that the underlying purpose of Appendix J is being met. For details concerning
the licensee's corrective actions for the previous Type C valve leakage, see the staff's Safety Evaluation dated
February 22, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Notice (IN) No. 85&hyph;71, ``Containment Integrated Leak Rate Tests,'' states that if Type B and C local
leakage rates constitute an identified contributor to the failure of the ``As-Found'' Type A test, the licensee may
submit a Corrective Action Plan with an alternate leakage test program proposal as an exemption request. If the submittal
is approved and an exemption granted, the licensee may implement the corrective action and alternate leakage rate
test program in lieu of the required increase in Type A test frequency incurred after the failure of two successive
Type A tests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IV
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission concluded that the licensee's Corrective Action Plan and proposed alternative test
schedule are acceptable and that a Type A test during refueling outage four (RFO 4) is not necessary. The licensee has
identified the problem penetrations that caused previous Type A failures in 1989 and 1992, and has implemented corrective
actions to address these problems. There is reasonable assurance that the containment leakage-limiting function
will be maintained. The normal Type A test schedule in Section III.D of Appendix J (three tests in 10 years) will require
the next Type A test to be performed during RFO 5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The special circumstances for granting this exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12 have also been identified. As stated
in part in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), special circumstances are present when application of the regulation in the particular
circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. The purpose of Section III.A.6.(b)
of Appendix J is to establish an increased testing frequency for Type A tests, where previous testing has demonstrated
unsatisfactory performance, in order to provide increased assurance that previous problems have been corrected.
After two consecutive tests at the increased testing frequency pass, the normal testing frequency of Section III.D.
may be resumed. By verifying that previous Type A test failures were due to Type C leakage and by implementing a Corrective
Action Plan to effectively correct previous Type C failure, the licensee has provided additional assurance that
containment integrity will be maintained. Consequently, the Commission concludes that the special circumstances
of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) exist in that application of the regulation in these particular circumstances is not necessary
to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, this exemption as described in Section
III above is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with
the common defense and security. The Commission further determines that special circumstances as provided in 10
CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) are present justifying the exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Commission hereby grants a one-time exemption as described in Section III above from the requirement
in 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, III.A.6.(b) to perform Type A containment ILRTs at an increased test frequency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 6977).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated July 21, 1993, Kennecott Uranium Company, holder of Source Material License SUA&hyph;1350 for the
Sweetwater Uranium Mill, requested an amendment to License Condition No. 10.6 to allow for disposal of byproduct
material from U.S. Energy's Green Mountain Ion Exchange Facility, which is being decommissioned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

2. Reason for Request to Amend License
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Kennecott Uranium Company's Sweetwater Mill is currently in a standby status. As a result, License Condition No.
10.6 limits disposal in the tailings impoundment to byproduct material in the form of debris generated by routine
site maintenance. Kennecott has requested that the license condition be amended to allow for disposal of byproduct
material from U.S. Energy Corporation's Green Mountain Ion Exchange Facility. This material is characterized as
byproduct material as defined in 10 CFR 40.4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon completion of the NRC staff's review of Kennecott's request, notice of the action to be taken regarding the amendment
request will be published in the

The Public Service Company of Colorado (PSC or the licensee) is the holder of Possession-Only License (POL) No. DPR&hyph;34,
which authorizes possession and maintenance of the Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating Station (FSV). The license
provides, among other things, that the plant is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission now or hereafter in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSV is a high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor that is located at the licensee's site in Weld County, Colorado. FSV
operated from January 31, 1974, to August 18, 1989. PSC shut down FSV due to control rod drive failures, and subsequently
made the shut down permanent due to a discovery of degradation of the steam generator ring headers. On November 5, 1990,
PSC submitted a Decommissioning Plan (DP) pursuant to 10 CFR 50.82 that proposed dismantling of FSV. On May 21, 1991,
the NRC revised License No. DPR&hyph;34 to POL that allows possession but not operation of FSV. The DP was approved
by NRC Order dated November 23, 1993. PSC is activately dismantling FSV. In addition, FSV has been defueled and all
fuel was transferred to the PSC Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) The ISFSI is licensed under 10
CFR part 72.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated February 25, 1993, the licensee requested a reduction in their primary financial coverage and an exemption
from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan for secondary level coverage as required in 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The justification presented by the licensee for the exemption request is that FSV is not authorized to operate, all
nuclear fuel has been removed from the reactor facility and transferred to the ISFSI, and the risk of accidents resulting
in a radiological release is now considerably less than during plant operation. The licensee contends that, with
all nuclear fuel removed from the reactor facility, the potential accidents as evaluated in the FSV DP only involve
events such as fires, electrical power outages, and the dropping of activated or contaminated materials during dismantling.
PSC concludes that these events result in doses to an individual located at the emergency planning zone boundary that
are orders of magnitude below 10 CFR part 100 guidelines, and are a small fraction of U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's ``Protective Action Guidelines.'' The NRC staff Safety Evaluation of the FSV DP (NRC Decommissioning Order
dated November 23, 1992) confirmed the PSC conclusion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the possession-only license and the decommissioning order prohibits operation of FSV, and all spent fuel
has been transferred from the reactor, the licensee contended that FSV is outside the ambit of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4)
and that 10 CFR 140.12 applies with its minimum requirement of $4,500,000 for financial protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the licensee indicated that it believed that reduced financial protection is warranted and that $50,000,000
in primary financial protection provides adequate coverage for liability stemming from any potential accident.
PSC also cited the FSV DP to demonstrate that there were no credible accidents associated with FSV that are comparable,
in consequence or severity, to the design basis accidents of an operating facility. PSC concluded that the requested
$50,000,000 in primary financial protection insurance coverage is adequate for any fire, accident, or other hazardous
event that could credibly occur while decommissioning FSV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PSC concluded that the requirement for secondary insurance only applies to plants licensed to operate and is not applicable
to FSV. PSC stated that it should not be unfairly burdened with financial liability at another nuclear facility because
potential damages from an accident at FSV are reduced to the extent that it could not benefit from the secondary protection.
The NRC staff independently evaluated the legal and technical issues associated with the application of the Price-Anderson
Act to permanently shutdown reactors in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, ``Financial Protection Required of Licensees
of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,'' May 10, 1993. In this evaluation, the staff concluded that
the NRC has discretionary authority to respond to licensee requests for reduction in the level of primary financial
protection and withdrawal from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan. Lastly, the staff concluded
that accidents and hazards insured against under Price-Anderson go beyond design basis accidents and beyond those
considered ``credible'' as that term is used in 10 CFR part 100 and in interpreting the application of that regulation.
The Commission issued a Staff Requirements Memorandum (SRM) based on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127 on July 13, 1993. In
the SRM, the Commission approved the staff's recommendation to permit, through the exemption process, a reduction
of primary level coverage to $100,000,000 and a withdrawal from participation in the secondary financial protection
layer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the exercise of its discretionary authority, the NRC may, so long as a potential hazard exists at a permanently shutdown
reactor, require the full amount of primary financial protection and full participation in the industry retrospective
rating plan. At such time that the hazard is determined to no longer exist, the NRC may reduce the amount of primary financial
protection and permit the licensee to withdraw from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the legislative history does not explicitly consider the potential hazards that might exist after termination
of operation, the staff generically evaluated the offsite consequences associated with normal and abnormal operations,
design basis accidents, and beyond design basis accidents for reactors that have been permanently defueled and shutdown.
The staff concluded that, aside from the handling, storage, and transportation of radioactive materials, no reasonably
conceivable potential accident exists at FSV that could cause significant offsite damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A severe transportation accident could potentially result in local contamination requiring cleanup and offsite
liabilities resulting from traffic disruption and loss of use. This type of accident would warrant maintaining some
level of liability insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most significant accident sequence for a permanently defueled and shut down reactor with no fuel onsite involves
a fire or the dropping of contaminated or activated components during decommissioning operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff independently evaluated the legal and technical justifications for the exemption presented by PSC.
The NRC recognizes that FSV is: (1) Permanently shutdown; (2) defueled; (3) licensed with ``possession only'' status
under a decommissioning order and an amended license that does not permit fuel at the reactor facility; and (4) actively
being dismantled. The staff concurred with the PSC's evaluation of credible accidents at FSV and their minimal associated
offsite consequences. The licensee identified need for continuing liability coverage, $50,000,000, was limited
to liability stemming from any fire, accident, or other hazardous events. However, coverage needs associated with
transportation of radioactive materials or precautionary evacuations were not identified. Although the licensee
presented legal views and opinions regarding the applicability of 10 CFR 140.12 versus 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4), the staff
did not concur with these legal views and opinions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee also contended that compliance with existing regulations would result in potential payment of retrospective
assessments under the secondary indemnity plan and payments of insurance premiums under the primary financial protection
plan. These payments would constitute an ``unfair burden'' to the licensee and its ratepayers. The staff recognizes
that relief from financial protection requirements is warranted because the potential hazards and consequences
associated with a permanently shut down reactor with no spent fuel are greatly reduced, and that a permanently shut
down reactor does not contribute a level of risk to the participants in the secondary pool proportionate to that of
an operating reactor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff, on its own initiative, did consider liability coverage needs associated with decommissioning activities
and transportation of radioactive materials. The results of our evaluation, as embodied in the July 13, 1993, SRM,
based on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, allow a reduction in the amount of financial protection required of licensees of
large nuclear plants that have been prematurely shut down. FSV meets the criterion established in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127
for relief from financial protection requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the licensee requested a new primary financial protection coverage level of $50,000,000, the staff has
also concluded that claims settlement experience at the Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI&hyph;2) (an accident which
did not result in a significant release of radioactivity) provides a reasonable basis for establishing the appropriate
level of primary insurance coverage. Because TMI&hyph;2 claims have reached $60,000,000 and a large number of TMI&hyph;2
claims are still unsettled, the staff concluded that a level of $100,000,000 for primary financial protection coverage
is warranted. This level of primary insurance coverage is consistent with the SRM dated July 13, 1993.

The staff, based on its independent evaluation as embodied in the July 13, 1993, SRM on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127 ``Financial
Protection Required of Licensees of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,'' has concluded that sufficient
bases exist for our approval of relief from the financial protection requirements for the FSV. The staff has also concluded
that granting the proposed exemption does not increase the probability or consequences of any accidents or reduce
the margin of safety at this facility.

Based on Sections III and IV above, the NRC has determined, that pursuant to 10 CFR 140.8, that this exemption is authorized
by law and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the NRC grants an exemption from the requirements from 10
CFR 140.11(a)(4) to the extent that primary financial protection in the amount of $100,000,000 shall be maintained
and that an exemption from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan (secondary level financial protection)
is granted for FSV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the NRC has determined that the granting of this exemption will not have a significant effect

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1377 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 3106) requires the U.S. Trade Representative
(USTR) to review annually the operation and effectiveness of each telecommunications trade agreement in force between
the United States and another country or countries, and to determine whether any act, policy, or practice of the foreign
country that entered into the agreement (1) is not in compliance with the terms of the agreement, or (2) otherwise denies,
within the context of the agreement, mutually advantageous market opportunities to U.S. telecommunications products
and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 1377, USTR has determined that certain practices of Japan with respect to cellular telephone
products and services are not in compliance with Japan's commitments under a June 28, 1989 agreement on third party
radio and cellular telecommunications equipment. Section 1377 requires this affirmative determination to be treated
as an affirmative determination under section 304(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(1)(A)).
Accordingly, USTR will request the section 301 Committee to recommend what action, if any, should be taken under section
301 (19 U.S.C. 2411). USTR will publish notice of any proposed action and will provide an opportunity for interested
persons to present views.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This determination is the second affirmative determination under section 1377 on this issue. In the first determination,
made on April 28, 1989 (54 FR 19624), USTR found that, for the reasons cited below, Japan was not in compliance with agreements
on third party radio and cellular telecommunications equipment encompassed in a series of letters and joint communications
between the United States and Japan pursuant to the ``MOSS'' (Market-Oriented Sector-Selective) discussions that
took place between 1985 and 1987.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, USTR found that the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) had declined to license
the operation in the Tokyo and Nagoya area of a cellular telephone system based on U.S. technology. This system was
licensed in the rest of Japan, but subscribers to the system could not use their cellular telephones in the Tokyo-Nagoya
area, i.e. they could not ``roam'' into Tokyo-Nagoya. Users of competing Japanese-technology cellular systems
could ``roam'' throughout the country. USTR determined that the failure to approve operation of a U.S. technology-based
system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area was inconsistent with the MOSS agreements, in which the Government of Japan committed
to take measures with respect to roaming in Tokyo-Nagoya by users of the U.S. technology-based system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following that determination, consultations led to the June 28, 1989 third party radio and cellular agreement that
is the subject of this determination. In the 1989 agreement, the Government of Japan committed to measures to enable
users of the U.S. technology-based system to roam in the Tokyo-Nagoya region. In the agreement, Japan reaffirmed
its commitment to the principle of ``comparable market access.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its review of the 1989 agreement, USTR found the following. To install the U.S. technology-based system in the Tokyo-Nagoya
region, MPT selected, notwithstanding concerns expressed by USTR and U.S. industry, a company that operates a competing
system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area using Japanese technology. This company has substantially delayed installing the
U.S. technology-based system in Tokyo. Nearly five years after the 1989 agreement, and nine years after the MOSS discussions
began, the new system covers only 40 percent of the Tokyo-Nagoya area. As a result, because users of the U.S. technology-based
system still are unable to roam throughout Tokyo-Nagoya, the U.S. technology-based system does not have comparable
market access with the Japanese systems, which offer full geographic coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USTR has consulted with other executive agencies and the private sector during this review, and has had discussions
with the Japanese Government regarding this agreement on more than seven occasions between July, 1993 and February
15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this review, USTR has determined that MPT's failure to ensure full coverage for the U.S. technology-based
system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area nearly five years after the 1989 third party radio and cellular agreement is inconsistent
with the terms of that agreement, and denies, within the context of the terms of that agreement, mutually advantageous
market opportunities in Japan for telecommunications products and services of the United States.

The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33291 (December 6, 1993),
58 FR 65207. No comments were received on the proposed rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, paragraph (g)(1) of Exchange Rule 17.50 provides the following fine schedule for persons who violate
the position limits established in CBOE Rule 4.11, ``Position Limits,'' and 24.4, ``Position Limits for Board-Based
Index Options:'' (1) A letter of caution plus $1 per contract over 5% of the applicable limit for one to three position
limit violations within one calendar year; (2) $1 per contract over the limit for four to six position limit violations
within one calendar year; and (3) $5 per contract over the applicable limit for seven or more position limit violations
within one calendar year. The CBOE proposes to amend paragraph (g)(1) to establish a separate fine schedule for position
limit violations which occur in non-CBOE member customer accounts (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
accounts of customers who are not CBOE members) carried by CBOE member firms, including the accounts of non-member
broker-dealers. The proposal will increase the number of cumulative infractions that may occur in non-member customer
accounts before a fine is triggered. Specifically, under new subparagraph (a), the following fines, which will be
imposed on CBOE member firms, will apply to position limit violations occurring in non-member customer accounts:
(1) A letter of caution for position limit violations up to 5% in excess of the applicable limit plus $1 per contract
above that level for one to six violations within one calendar year; (2) $1 per contract over the applicable limit for
seven to 12 position limit violations within one calendar year; and (3) $5 per contract over the applicable limit for
13 or more position limit violations within one calendar year. In calculating the fine thresholds for each CBOE member,
all non-member customer account position limit violations occurring within a single calendar year in all of the member's
non-member customer accounts will be added together.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Exchange proposes to rephrase the current language of subparagraph (b) to indicate more clearly
that a letter of caution is given for position limit violations of up to 5% of the applicable limit for one to three position
limit violations occurring within a single calendar year, and that a fine of $1 per contract applies to violations
exceeding that limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the proposal accommodates key monitoring-related differences between non-member customer
accounts and the accounts of members. The CBOE states that although CBOE members are well positioned generally to
prevent, or to detect and promptly correct, position limit infractions in their own accounts or in accounts they carry
for CBOE market makers, the CBOE and its member are positioned less effectively to monitor the aggregate trading commitments
of non-CBOE broker-dealers or customers and to ensure the prompt correction of position limit violations by such
persons. The CBOE states that factors such as customers trading through multiple firms, customers entering into
Clearing Member Trade Assignment (``CMTA'') agreements,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 firms having multiple registered representatives, and investment advisors managing several accounts make it more
difficult as a practical matter for member firms to prevent, or to detect and correct, a position limit violation by
a customer, including a broker-dealer ``customer,'' who is not a CBOE member. As a result, the CBOE believes that the
fine tiers suitable with respect to CBOE members' own accounts can be inappropriately strict when applied to firms
carrying a number of non-member customer accounts.

The CMTA is a process offered by the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') which enables an OCC clearing member to
have trades executed on its behalf on an exchange without holding exchange membership. In order to participate in
this process, the OCC clearing member who has authorized an exchange member to execute trades on its behalf must file
a CMTA agreement with the OCC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the proposal will permit the effective enforcement of the Exchange's position limit rules
while taking into account compliance and monitoring realities. The CBOE states that situations involving numerous
violations and/or substantial overages will continue to be referred to the CBOE's Business Conduct Committee (``BCC'')
for appropriate sanctions on a case by case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just
and equitable principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. In addition, the
Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(6) requirement that the rules of an exchange
provide that its members, and persons associated with its members, be appropriately disciplined for violation of
the rules of the exchange. Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposal, in this limited context, should
provide the CBOE with a prompt and effective means to enforce compliance with position limits while taking into account
the difficulties of CBOE members in detecting and correcting position limit infractions by non-member customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the CBOE's proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the Exchange's need to enforce
its position limit rules and its desire to take into consideration the difficulties of CBOE members in detecting position
limit violations that occur in non-member customer accounts. Further, the Commission believes that the revised
fine schedule will prove sufficient to deter position limit violations. In this regard, by tallying the infractions
in all of a member's non-member customer accounts cumulatively for purposes of the fine schedule, the proposal will
require members to continually monitor compliance for position limit violations in non-member customer accounts.
In addition, the Commission notes that the CBOE plans to refer cases involving numerous violations and/or substantial
overages to the Exchange's BCC, thus providing the Exchange with the flexibility to impose a stricter sanction for
more egregious infractions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the CBOE's rephrasing of the current language of new subparagraph (b) is consistent with
the Act in that it clarifies Exchange Rule 17.50(b), thereby facilitating the enforcement of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,

Exchange Rule 96 currently prohibits a member registered as a Competitive Trader
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 or Registered Competitive Market Maker (``RCMM'')
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 from initiating, while on the Floor of the Exchange, the purchase or sale, for his own account or his member organization's
account, of any stock in which he has an option position, or in which he knows his firm has an option position. Rule 96
currently applies to all options, including those traded on a national securities exchange (``listed options'').
The proposed rule change would remove the prohibition in Rule 96 as to listed options.

A Competitive Trader is a NYSE member who is authorized to initiate proprietary transactions on the Floor of the Exchange
but who is not registered as a specialist, odd-lot dealer or Registered Competitive Market Maker. See NYSE Rules 111

of the Act. See also SEC Rule 11a1&hyph;1(T). In addition, the NYSE requires that 75 percent of a Competitive Trader's
monthly transactions must be stabilizing transactions under the tick-test. See NYSE Rule 112(d).

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 96 was adopted in the mid-1930's after extensive investigations and public hearings by the Commission concerning
manipulative practices and ``pool'' operations involving the use of options. At present, Rule 96 prohibits a member
registered as a Competitive Trader or RCMM from initiating, while on the Floor, the purchase or sale, for his own account
or his member organization's account, of any stock in which he has an option position, or in which he knows his firm has
an option position. Rule 96 does not prohibit a Competitive Trader or RCMM from trading in options; rather, the rule
simply provides that such members may not initiate a proprietary trade in a stock on the Floor where they have an option
position in the stock. Rule 96 currently applies to all options, including those traded over-the-counter (``OTC
options``) and listed options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to remove the prohibition in Rule 96 as to listed options. Thus, under the
proposed rule change, a Competitive Trader or RCMM would be permitted to initiate a proprietary purchase or sale of
stock on the Floor where he has a listed option position in that stock, but not where he has an OTC option position in that
stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is appropriate for three reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) By removing a restraint on members' initiating transactions on the Floor, the proposed rule change can be expected
to add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Listed options are substantially different from the OTC options which Rule 96 was originally intended to regulate,
and any regulatory concerns that might arise as to listed options can be addressed by monitoring and surveillance
of revised Rule 96.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed rule change will remove a competitive barrier to fair competition, since no other professionals
are subject to comparable restrictions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Enhancement to the Exchange Market
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange established the membership categories of Competitive Trader and RCMM to provide a means whereby members,
subject to certain conditions, could add to the quality of the Exchange market by initiating proprietary transactions
on the Floor. The current restriction in Rule 96 defeats this purpose in some instances by precluding Floor professionals
from initiating such Floor transactions in any stock where they have an option position overlying such stock (or where
they know their member organization has such an option position).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes the proposed rule change will further the purposes of Rule 107 by facilitating RCMM participation
as dealers on the Exchange. Currently, the prohibition in Rule 96 conflicts with the purposes of Rule 107 by effectively
precluding RCMMs from participating as dealers in any stock where they have an option positin in that stock. By deleting
the prohibition in Rule 96 as to listed options, the proposed rule change will eliminate this barrier to RCMM dealer
participation, thereby permitting RCMMs to add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market in situation where
they currently may not do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a similar vein, the proposed rule change will facilitate transactions by Competitive Traders on the Floor by permitting
them to initiate such transactions in a stock where they have an option position in such stock. This enhanced ability
to initiate transactions on the Floor will, as with RCMMs, add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Concerns
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 96 was adopted in the mid-1930's to regulate trading where members have a position in OTC options, not listed options,
and the trading abuses in the OTC market that gave rise to Rule 96 are simply not present with respect to today's closely
surveilled trading in listed options. The Exchange believes that regulatory concerns as to listed option trading
can be addressed by monitoring and surveillance of revised Rule 96.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange notes that if the prohibition in Rule 96 were to be removed as to listed options, RCMMs and Competitive
Traders would remain subject to the restrictions on members' on-Floor proprietary transactions stated in Rules
108 and 112,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and thus would not be in any greater position to exploit their alleged time and place advantage over public investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Rule 108, an on-Floor order placed by a member to establish or increase a position in the member's proprietary
account is not entitled to priority, or precedence based on size, over an off-Floor order placed by a public customer.
On-Floor and off-floor are defined in rule 112; that rule also prohibits frontrunning of block transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Removal of Barrier to Fair Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange notes that off-Floor professionals (including specialists and market makers on regional exchanges)
are not subject to any restrictions in effacing off-Floor proprietary trades in a stock where they have an option position
(whether a listed or OTC option) in that stock. Thus, off-Floor professional can be said to enjoy a significant competitive
advantage over Floor professionals on the Exchange, who are restricted in their on-Floor proprietary transactions
in a stock where they have an option position in that stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange acknowledges that a floor professional my initiate an off-Floor order in a stock where he has an option
position in that stock. However, a significant reason why Competitive Traders and RCMMs become registered as such
is to be able, in the routine conduct of their business, to initiate proprietary trades 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
on the Floor rather than ``upstairs.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, the ability of Floor professionals to initiate off-Floor orders in a stock in which they have an option position
is largely meaningless when viewed in the context of the way such professionals routinely conduct their business.
The Exchange does not believe that any viewed in the context of the way such professionals routinely conduct their
business, when off-Floor professionals are not subject to comparable restrictions in the routine conduct of their
business.

SEC Staff Comments on SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;76&hyph;54
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to proposed changes to Rules 96, 102, and 105 that were submitted in file No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;76&hyph;54,
the SEC staff suggested that the Exchange's proposals be revised so that Floor professionals would be permitted to
use listed options only for hedging purposes.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Most of the SEC staff's comments were directed specifically at specialists' trading of specialty stock options pursuant
to Rule 105.

The NYSE submitted File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;76&hyph;54 to the Commission on October 22, 1976. The proposed rule
change was noticed for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release 12924 (October 27, 1976), 41 FR 48430 (November
3, 1976). The file, like other options proposals that raised significant regulatory issues, became dormant during
the ``options moratorium'' in order to allow the Commission to complete its Special Study of the Options Markets.
Shortly thereafter, the NYSE refiled its proposals to amend Rule 96 (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;82&hyph;19) and
Rules 102 and 105 (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;82&hyph;20). In early 1985, the Commission approved the latter rule
filing, thereby permitting NYSE specialists to trade options on their specialty stock but, consistent with the staff's
earlier comments, only for hedging purposes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21710 (February 4, 1985), 50 FR 5708 (February 11, 1985). The amendments to Rule
96, however, were noticed but never received Commission approval.

 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20006 (July 26, 1983), 48 FR 35217 (August 3, 1983). On March 15, 1993, the NYSE
withdrew File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;82&hyph;19 and resubmitted the substance of that proposal as this File No.
SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;17.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While Rule 105 permits specialists to use listed options to offset the risks of making markets in stocks in which they
are registered, the Exchange does not believe that it would be appropriate to re-structure Rule 96 along the lines
of Rule 105. A ``hedging limitation'' in such a re-structured version of Rule 96 would have the effect of requiring
Competitive Traders and RCMMs to use listed options only to offset the risk of loss in stock positions which they acquired
as a result of orders in such stocks that were initiated on the Floor. In practice, such a limitation would be even more
restrictive than the current regulation, which, as noted above, permits Floor professionals to trade in listed options,
but simply precludes them from initiating an order on the Floor in a stock which underlies such option position. The
Exchange does not believe that making Rule 96 even more stringent than it is today would serve any valid regulatory
purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, Rule 96 does not prohibit a Competitive Trader or RCMM from trading in options, but provides only that
he may not initiate a proprietary order on the Floor in any stock where he has an option position in that stock. The Exchange
does not believe that any sort of ``reverse hedging limitation'' in Rule 96 would make sense because it would mean,
in effect, that a Competitive Trader or RCMM could initiate a proprietary trade on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Floor if necessary to hedge an option position. However, the primary dealings of RCMMs and Competitive Traders are
in stocks, not the overlying options. In the Exchange's view, a ``reverse hedging limitation'' in Rule 96 would bear
no relation to the practical business dealings of RCMMs and Competitive Traders, and would constitute an unnecessary
burden of over-regulation given the minimal potential for trading abuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory bases for the proposed rule change are sections 6(b)(5), 6(b)(8) and 11A(a)(1)(c)(ii) of the Act. By
removing the prohibition on Competitive Traders and RCMMs initiating proprietary transactions on the Floor in a
stock where they have a listed option position in such stock, and thereby permitting such members to add to the depth
and liquidity of the Exchange market in situations where they may not currently do so, the proposed rule change will
have the effect of ``facilitating transactions in securities'' and will ``perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market,'' as called for in section 6(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that the proposed rule change permits Floor professionals to initiate transactions on a more equal regulatory
footing with other securities professionals, the proposed rule change is designed to eliminate unfair discrimination
between brokers or dealers, as called for in section 6(b)(5); to remove a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as called for in section 6(b)(8); and to promote fair competition among brokers
and dealers, as called for in section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii).

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. In fact, the proposed rule change will enhance competition
by permitting Floor professionals to initiate proprietary transactions on a more equal regulatory plane with all
other securities professionals.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant is an internally managed, diversified closed-end registered investment company. As of December 31,
1993, applicant had outstanding 3,875,600 shares of common stock. Applicant's common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ
National Market System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Before March 26, 1993, applicant was licensed to operate as a small business investment company (``SBIC'') under
the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, and provided long-term, primarily variable rate, secured
loans to finance the growth, expansion, and modernization of small businesses. Applicant was granted an exemption
from various provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder to permit it to create a holding company structure.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The purpose of the holding company structure was to allow applicant to expand its business beyond that of an SBIC. Although
applicant is no longer an SBIC, it will continue to provide secured loans to finance the growth, expansion, and modernization
of small business entities.

3. On March 26, 1993, applicant transferred its SBIC license to Bando McGlocklin Small Business Investment Corporation
(the ``Subsidiary''), a Wisconsin corporation, under a plan of reorganization under section 351 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code''). Under the plan, virtually all of applicant's assets were transferred to the Subsidiary;
virtually all of applicant's liabilities were assumed by the Subsidiary; and all of the issued and outstanding shares
of the Subsidiary's common stock were issued to applicant. Since March 26, 1993, substantially all of applicant's
business has been conducted through the Subsidiary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. As an internally-managed investment company, applicant employs its own personnel and advisory staff. Applicant
currently maintains two incentive stock option plans in accordance with two orders issued to applicant when it was
an SBIC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. To induce key employees to remain in the employ of applicant and its subsidiaries and to increase the incentive and
personal interest of such employees in the welfare of applicant and its subsidiaries, applicant's Board of Directors
on August 25, 1993, approved the 1993 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the ``Plan''). Applicant's shareholders subsequently
approved the Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Plan, which is substantially similar to the previous plans, provides for the grant of options to purchase a maximum
of 100,000 shares of applicant's common stock. Applicant has agreed not to issue more than 85,672 shares under the
Plan, so that the total number of shares that may be issued under all of applicant's incentive stock option plans will
not exceed 7.5% of applicant's currently issued and outstanding shares without a subsequent SEC order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Only key employees of applicant and its subsidiaries will be eligible to receive options. The Plan provides that
if an option granted under the Plan expires or is terminated unexercised, the shares of common stock covered by that
option will again be available for the grant of new options under the Plan. In addition, the Plan provides that not more
than 29,985 shares may be issued to one participant through the exercise of options granted under the Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicant currently has five key employees (its three executive officers, its controller, and its general counsel),
who serve in identical capacities with the Subsidiary. Applicant anticipates that options to purchase shares of
common stock under the Plan will be granted to applicant's three executive officers when and if the requested order
is received. The number and specific terms of the options to be granted to such persons have not yet been determined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicant's executive officers not only have the responsibility for making applicant's investments, but also
for making all executive and operational decisions. As the executive officers of applicant, their performance directly
affects applicant's performance and the value of applicant's common stock. To a lesser extent, the performance of
applicant's controller and its general counsel, who participate in operational decisions, but do not make executive
decisions, also directly affects the value of applicant's common stock. The performance of applicant's other employees
does not directly affect applicant's performance. It therefore would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Plan
to grant such employees stock options, since no matter how competently they performed their duties, their performance
probably would not affect the value of applicant's common stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of applicant's Board of Directors. The Compensation
Committee consists of five directors of applicant, a majority of whose members are not ``interested persons'' of
applicant, as defined in section 2(a)(19). Members of the Compensation Committee may not receive options under the
Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. All of the options to be granted pursuant to the Plan will be incentive stock options within the meaning of section
422 (formerly section 422A) of the Code. As incentive stock options, the following restrictions apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Plan must state the aggregate number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of options and the
class of employees eligible to receive options; the Plan also must be approved by applicant's shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All options must be granted within ten years of the date the Plan was adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Options may not be exercised more than ten years after the date on which they are granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The exercise price of the options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of
grant. In accordance with this provision, options will be granted at the last quoted sale price of the underlying stock
on the date of grant or, if there is no sale on such date, the options will be granted at the mean between the closing bid
and asked quotations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Options may not be transferable by an optionee (otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution),
and may be exercised during the lifetime of the optionee only by the optionee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Options may not be granted to persons owning more than 10% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of applicant's
common stock at the time the options are granted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(g) The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the option is granted) of the stock with respect to which
options are exercisable for the first time by an individual in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Stock acquired upon exercise of options may not be sold for two years from the grant date or one year from the exercise
date, whichever is later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Options may be exercised by the optionee only if the optionee was an employee or officer of applicant during the
entire period commencing with the grant date and ending three months prior to the exercise date, unless termination
of employment is caused by death or disability, in which case the option may be exercised within one year following
termination of employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The Plan does not provide for the grant of stock appreciation rights. The Plan does permit the exercise price of
an option to be paid in cash or by tendering previously acquired shares of stock, valued at the fair market value as determined
by the Compensation Committee. In placing a fair market value on previously acquired shares of applicant's common
stock, applicant will use the same standards as are used in determining the fair market value at the time of the grant
of the option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The Compensation Committee may determine in its sole discretion that an adjustment in the number or kind of shares
reserved for issuance under the Plan but not yet covered by options or of the stock then subject to options is necessary,
or that an adjustment in the option price in each stock option agreement is necessary because of a change in the number
or kind of outstanding shares of stock of applicant (or of any stock or other securities into which such shares of stock
shall have been changed or for which it shall have been exchanged), whether through reorganization, recapitalization,
stock split, combination of shares, merger or consolidation, or any other change in the number or kind of outstanding
shares of stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Applicant also has a profit sharing plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, which is intended to provide
a source of retirement income for employees. In accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended, applicant's profit sharing plan does not discriminate in favor of shareholders,
officers, and highly compensated employees as to coverage, benefits, contributions, or otherwise. Applicant to
date has not contributed the maximum permissible amount in any year. The Plan is not a substitute for a profit-sharing
plan qualified under section 401(a), as it is intended to provide incentive compensation and does not establish a
source of income for an employee's retirement years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant's Legal Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 18(d) prohibits any registered management investment company from issuing warrants or rights to subscribe
to or purchase its securities except those issued ratably to a class of security holders with an exercise period of
up to 120 days, or in exchange for warrants in connection with a reorganization. The issuance of stock options by applicant
to its employees would not satisfy these statutory exceptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The issuance of stock options to applicant's employees also would be prohibited under section 23. Section 23(a)
generally prevents a registered closed-end investment company from issuing any of its securities for services or
for property other than cash or securities. Because the issuance of stock options by applicant may constitute the
issuance of securities for services, absent exemptive relief, it would be prohibited by section 23(a). Section 23(b)
prohibits the sale by a closed-end investment company of any stock of which it is the issuer at a price below current
net asset value, except with the consent of a majority of its common stockholders at the time of issuance or under certain
other enumerated circumstances. If the net asset value of applicant's common stock were to increase following the
grant of an option, the option exercise price may be less than the net asset value of a share of applicant's common stock
on the date of exercise. Furthermore, section 23(c) generally prohibits the purchase by a registered closed-end
investment company of any securities of which it is the issuer. Thus, to the extent that payment for stock options with
previously acquired shares of applicant's common stock is considered to be a purchase by applicant of its own securities,
section 23(c) would prohibit the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1(a) thereunder also prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment
company from participating in, or offering a transaction in connection with, any joint enterprise or other joint
arrangement or profit-sharing plan in which the registered company is a participant unless an order permitting the
transaction has been granted by the SEC. Paragraph (c) of rule 17d&hyph;1 includes stock option plans in the definition
of joint enterprise, joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan prohibited by section 17(d). These provisions therefore
may prohibit any stock option plan absent an order from the SEC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Although applicant is engaged primarily in the business of making loans to small businesses, it is no longer an SBIC
and therefore is unable to rely on an existing SEC order permitting SBICs to issue stock options to their employees
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 or on rule 17d&hyph;1(d)(4). Additionally, both the order and the rule specifically provide that the options granted
must be ``qualified stock options'' under former section 422 of the Code and must conform to the requirements of 13
CFR 805(b) adopted by the Small Business Administration. ``Qualified stock options'' were eliminated in 1976. Thus,
although the incentive stock options provided for in the Plan have many of the same characteristics as qualified stock
options under former section 422, they have some minor differences, which are fully described in the application.
Applicant is also unable to rely upon a similar order granted to the Association of Publicly Traded Investment Funds
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 because the order does not extend to registered closed-end investment companies that are engaged primarily in the
business of making loans to small businesses.

5. Section 6(c) provides that the SEC may grant an exemption from the provisions of the Act if such exemption is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes intended by
the policy and provisions of the Act. Rule 17d&hyph;1(b) requires the SEC, in passing upon an application regarding
a joint enterprise, joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan, to consider whether the participation of the investment
company in the transaction is consistent with the policies and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation
is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. Section 23(c)(3) requires the SEC
to insure that repurchases by closed-end funds of their own securities are on a basis which does not unfairly discriminate
against any holders of the class of securities to be purchased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicant submits that the limitations on the requested order will provide protection to investors against dilution
of their 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
interests that are similar to those the SEC previously has found consistent with the purposes and policies of the Act
and even greater than those Congress imposed on stock options to be issued by business development companies. The
Plan has been approved by applicant's shareholders, and any options granted under the Plan must be approved by a majority
of applicant's directors who are not interested persons of applicant and who cannot participate in the Plan. In addition,
the total percentage of shares that could be issued under the Plan, the 1987 Plan, and the 1990 Plan will be limited to
7.5% of the outstanding shares of applicant's common stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicant states that the abuses and adverse effects of investment company stock options would have no applicability
to stock options granted under the Plan. The limited stock options that could be granted under the Plan would offer
no opportunity for any change in control of applicant or quick sale at a profit. Additionally, the options themselves
would not be transferable. Moreover, the existence and nature of the stock options granted by applicant would be fully
disclosed in accordance with the standards or guidelines adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board for
operating companies and the requirements of the SEC, and will be neither so extensive nor so complex as to make the financial
statements of applicant or management remuneration more difficult to understand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicant's investments (other than investments in idle funds) are in small businesses, the securities of which
will not be publicly traded. In addition, all of applicant's investments in small businesses consist of non-convertible
secured loans. Under these circumstances, applicant believes that it is difficult to conceive a scenario in which
applicant's portfolio investments could create a short-term artificial increase in the price of applicant's stock.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Applicant submits that, in the event this application is granted, any adverse impact on investor interests protected
by the Act will be minimal, and further, will be more than outweighed by the benefits to investors that will result from
permitting applicant to compete for top quality personnel on a more equal footing with its competitors. Applicant
competes primarily with banks and other entities that are not investment companies registered under the Act. These
organizations are able to offer stock options to employees and have an advantage over applicant in attracting and
retaining highly qualified personnel. In order for applicant to compete on a more equal basis with such organizations,
it has to have personnel as competent as such organizations, and in order to attract and retain such personnel, applicant
must be able to offer comparable compensation packages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. For the foregoing reasons, applicant believes that the applicant satisfies the standards for relief set forth
in sections 6(c), 17(d), and 23(c) of the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder.

Applicant agrees that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Applicant's directors, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of applicant, will
review periodically the potential impact that the grant or exercise of stock options could have on applicant's earnings
and net asset value per share, such review to take place prior to any decisions to grant stock options, but in no event
less frequently than annually. Adequate procedures and records will be maintained to permit such review by applicant's
directors, and the directors will have the authority to take appropriate steps if necessary to ensure that neither
the grant nor the exercise of stock options would have an effect contrary to the interests of investors in these areas.
The directors' authority will include, in addition to the authority to prevent or limit the grant of additional stock
options, the authority to limit the number of stock options exercised in a given period of time if the directors conclude
that the effect on applicant's expenses or earnings would be contrary to the interests of investors or that net asset
value per share might be excessively diluted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. No more than 85,672 shares will be issued pursuant to the Plan, absent a subsequent exemptive order from the SEC with
respect to the remaining 14,328 shares authorized under the Plan.

DQE, Inc. et al. (70&hyph;8096)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DQE, Inc. (``DQE''), P.O. Box 68, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15230&hyph;0068, and its wholly owned subsidiary company,
Duquesne Enterprises, Inc. (``DE''), Grant Building, 330 Grant Street, suite 2420, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219,
both Pennsylvania public-utility holding companies exempt from registration under section 3(a)(1) of the Act pursuant
to Rule 2, have filed an application under sections 9(a)(2) and 10 of the Act in connection with the acquisition of Allegheny
Development Corporation (``ADC''), a wholly owned subsidiary of DE, that operates an energy services business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DQE was organized in 1989 for the purpose of becoming a holding company for Duquesne Light Company (``DLC''), an electric
utility company, and other energy-related subsidiaries. DLC is engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution
and sale of electric energy and serves an area of approximately 800 square miles which includes the City of Pittsburgh.
DE's subsidiaries other than ADC are engaged in real estate ventures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987 a competitive bidding process was initiated by the County of Allegheny, Pennsylvania (``County'') for the
design, installation and operation of facilities to provide a complete energy services package to the new Midfield
Terminal Complex being developed to replace the then existing airline terminal at the Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport (``Airport''). DLC was the supplier of electric energy to the Airport at that time. The applicants state that
DLC, a utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, was not in a position to
submit a competitive bid; however, it was important to participate in the bidding to avoid the loss of a significant
DLC customer when the Airport ceased operation. Consequently, ADC then a wholly-owned subsidiary of DLC, submitted
a bid to the County and was awarded the contract out of a field of 12 bidders. As a result, ADC became a public utility company
within the meaning of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 7, 1989, DLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of QE by virtue of a merger transaction. ADC was still a wholly-owned
subsidiary of DLC. An Energy Services Agreement (``Agreement'') dated May 31, 1989 between the County and ADC was
entered into on July 27, 1989. In December 1989, DLC distributed all of the stock of ADC to DQE as a dividend and later
in December 1989, DQE contributed the ADC stock to the capital of DE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agreement requires ADC to supply all of the electrical and thermal requirements of the Midfield Terminal Complex,
including electricity, hot water and chilled water. ADC purchases electricity at tariff rates from DLC and sells
a portion to the County at the unit costs specified in the Agreement. The County also is required to pay to ADC an annual
fixed charge related to ADC's investment in the facilities. The County is the sole customer for the energy services
provided by ADC.

OLS Acquisition Corp., et al. (70&hyph;8311) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OLS Acquisition Corporation (``Acquisition Corp.'') and OLS Energy-Berkeley (``Berkeley''), One Upper Pond Road,
Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, both indirect nonutility subsidiaries of Energy Initiatives, Inc. (``EII''), an
indirect subsidiary of General Public Utilities Corporation, a registered holding company, have filed an application-declaration
pursuant to sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(a), and 12(b) of the Act and Rule 45 thereunder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated August 1, 1989 (HCAR No. 24931), the Commission authorized OLS Power Limited Partnership, a Delaware
limited partnership and an indirect subsidiary of EII, to, among other things, acquire indirectly through Acquisition
Corp. all of the outstanding common stock of OLS-Energy-Chino, a California corporation (``Chino''), OLS Energy-Camarillo,
a California corporation (``Camarillo''), and Berkeley. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Berkeley, Chino and Camarillo are each lessees, pursuant to leases (``Leases'') with General Electric Capital Corporation
or a wholly owned subsidiary (collectively, ``GECC'') of operating cogeneration facilities (``Facilities'')
located in California, which are all qualifying facilities under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.
The Leases expire, in the cases of Chino and Camarillo, on December 31, 2007, and in the case of Berkeley, on August 7,
2007, but may be renewed, subject to certain conditions, for up to 10 years at the lessee's option. Rent payable during
such renewal term would be the then fair market rent for the respective Facility, or, for an initial three year renewal
term, an amount which has been agreed upon if the renewal option which provides for payment of rent in such agreed upon
amount is elected by the lessee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of the acquisition, Berkeley, Chino and Camarillo each were parties to revolving credit agreements (``Credit
Agreement(s)'') with FECC that provided for the short-term working capital requirements of their respective Facilities.
Berkeley, Chino and Camarillo have issued secured promissory notes to GECC evidencing these borrowings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the acquisition, each company was unable to generate sufficient revenue from sales of steam and electricity
to pay its operating expenses and rent under its Lease on a current basis. In order to remedy the problem, the OLS Companies
ultimately reached agreement with GECC and their host institutions to restructure their Leases and the energy services
agreements under which they sell electricity and steam to their host institutions (``Energy Services Agreements'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 30, 1991, Chino and Camarillo entered into agreements with GECC and their respective host institutions
which, among other things, reduced the rent payable to GECC under their respective Leases, increased the amount each
could borrow and reduced the rate of interest payable under their respective Credit Agreements and reduced certain
rebates payable to their host institutions under their respective Energy Service Agreements. The amendments to
Chino's and Camarillo's Credit Agreements were authorized by orders of the Commission dated February 9, 1990 and
December 26, 1990 (HCAR Nos. 25038 and 25230). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to authorization granted in five previous orders of the Commission issued from 1990 through 1992, Berkeley
has previously amended its Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the aggregate amount of the borrowings
which may be outstanding at any time from $1 million to $1.25 million, extend the time period for borrowings to December
31, 1994, and reduce the rate of interest from 5% over the prime rate, as defined, to 3% over the prime rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to negotiations with GECC and the University of California at Berkeley (``University''), where the Berkeley
Facility is located, Berkeley now proposes to restructure (``Restructure'') the Lease with GECC as well as the Energy
Services Agreement with the University and related agreements. Berkeley also proposes to further amend the Credit
Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Restructure contemplates, among other things, that (i) rent payable to GECC under Berkeley's Lease will be reduced,
effective December 31, 1993, by approximately $780,000 per year and will be payable quarterly in amounts which track
expected revenue, rather than semi-annually in equal payments, and (ii) rebates payable to the University under
the Energy Services Agreement will be reduced or deferred to increase the cash retained by Berkeley to pay operating
expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the Restructure, Berkeley proposes to borrow, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent,
up to an aggregate amount outstanding of $1 million under a loan facility (``Overhaul Loan Facility'') as part of the
Berkeley Credit Agreement with GECC. The Overhaul Loan Facility would be used to fund the cost of major repairs, nonroutine
maintenance activities and overhauls of its Facility; provided that the initial advance under the Overhaul Loan
Facility may be used to pay amounts due fuel suppliers and the operator of the Facility, costs incurred to consummate
the Restructure, prepayments of working capital advances and rent under Lease.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Borrowings under the Overhaul Loan Facility may be made from time to time until August 7, 2007, and would bear interest
at a rate per annum of 3% in excess of the rate of interest per annum publicly announced by Morgan Guaranty Trust Company
as its commercial reference rate, or certain substantially equivalent rates of interest per annum if Morgan Guaranty
Trust Company ceases to announce such a rate of interest. Borrowings would be repayable on a fixed amortization schedule
over the lesser of three years or the remaining term of Berkeley's restructured Lease (August 7, 2007).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The obligation of GECC to make each loan under the Overhaul Loan Facility would be subject, among other conditions,
to the delivery of certain documentation, the absence of a material adverse change in the financial condition of Berkeley,
the showing by Berkeley in form and substance satisfactory to GECC that Berkeley will have sufficient cash to repay
the loan and the absence of a default under, among other agreements, the amended Lease and the amended Credit Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Berkeley also proposes to make the following amendments to the Credit Agreement: (1) Provide for the Overhaul Loan
Facility with GECC and borrow thereunder from time to time prior to August 7, 2007 in amounts of up to $1 million at any
time outstanding and issue to GECC its promissory note evidencing such borrowings; (2) change the aggregate amount
of the borrowings which may be outstanding at any time thereunder to the lesser of $1.25 million or $1.5 million less
the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement; (3) extend until August
7, 2007, which is the end of the term of Berkeley's restructured lease, for borrowings to be made and letters of credit
to be outstanding under the Credit Agreement; (4) provide that borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be made only
upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, such as certain documentation and the absence of a default
under, among other agreements, the amended lease and the amended Credit Agreement; and (5) provide for an origination
fee of $2,500 for the issuance of letters of credit in replacement of those presently outstanding under the Credit
Agreement, plus an annual fee of 1% per annum of the face amount of any such replacement letter of credit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acquisition Corp. also proposes to enter into a pledge agreement with U.S. Trust Company of New York, the owner trustee
and lessor or Berkeley's facility under its lease, pledging Berkeley's stock as security for Berkeley's obligations
under its amended Credit Agreement and in connection with the Restructure. Outstanding borrowings under the amended
Credit Agreement would be required to be repaid in full annually and the amended Credit Agreement would contain certain
other mandatory and optional prepayment provisions.

Applicants will not enter into the proposed refunding transactions unless, in each instance, the estimated present
value savings derived from the net difference between interest payments on the new issue of comparable securities
and on the securities to be refunded is, on an after tax basis, greater than the present value of all redemption and issuing
costs, assuming an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate used shall be the estimated after tax interest rate
on the securities to be issued.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust.
On November 21, 1989, applicant filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act and a registration
statement pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on January 11, 1990,
and applicant commenced its initial public offering shortly thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On June 11, 1993, applicant's board of directors approved a plan of reorganization whereby applicant agreed to
transfer substantially all of its assets to Smith Barney Shearson Aggressive Growth Fund Inc. (the ``Acquiring Fund''),
in exchange for shares of beneficial interest of the Acquiring Fund and the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of certain
liabilities of applicant. In accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8 of the Act, applicant's directors determined that
the sale of applicant's assets to the Acquiring Fund was in the best interests of applicant's shareholders, and that
the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result.

<FOOTNAME>

1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant and the Acquiring Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other by reason of having a common investment
adviser. Although purchases and sales between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a) of the
Act, rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated
persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. In approving the reorganization, the directors considered various factors, including, (a) the generally similar
investment objectives and policies of applicant and the Acquiring Fund, (b) the fact that the funds have the same investment
adviser, administrator, custodian, and transfer agent, (c) the significant savings in expenses for application's
shareholders, and (d) the fact that the larger asset base of the combined funds should result in further reduction
of expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Proxy materials soliciting shareholder approval of the reorganization were distributed to applicant's shareholders
of record on or about August 18, 1993. Preliminary and definitive copies of the proxy materials were filed with the
SEC. Applicant's shareholders approved the reorganization at a special meeting held on October 12, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. As of October 15, 1993 (the ``Closing Date''), applicant had 2,634,771 and 48,102 shares of Class A and Class B, respectively,
outstanding, having a net asset value of $26,604,523 and $482,443, respectively, and a per share net asset value of
$10.10 and $10.03, respectively. On the Closing Date, the reorganization was consummated. Applicant transferred
all, or substantially all, of its assets and certain stated liabilities to the Acquiring Fund. In exchange, the shareholders
of applicant received shares of the Acquiring Fund having an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset
value of their investment in applicant. Holders of Class A shares of applicant received Class A shares of the Acquiring
Fund, and holders of Class B shares of applicant received Class B shares of the Acquiring Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. On the Closing Date, applicant paid a capital gain distribution of $0.5240 per share which, together with all previous
such dividends, had the effect of distributing to its shareholders all of its respective investment company taxable
income for the taxable year ending on or prior to the Closing Date (computed without regard to any deduction for dividends
paid) and all of its respective net capital gain realized in the taxable year ending on or prior to the Closing Date (after
reduction for any capital loss carry forward).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The expenses in connection with the reorganization consisted of legal, accounting, printing, and administrative
expenses totalling approximately $20,000. These expenses were borne by applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceedings. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage
in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Computers provide privacy and access limitations by requiring a user name and password match. Access to decentralized
segments are similarly controlled. Only those personnel with a need to have access to the system are given user names
and passwords. The magnetic tape backups have limited access in that users must justify the need and obtain tape numbers
and volume identifiers from a central source before they are provided data tapes. Paper record and microfilm records
are in limited access areas in locking storage cabinets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Leave and Earnings Statements, and pay records are microfilmed and retained on site four years, then archived at the
Federal Record Center, and destroyed when 50 years old. The official copy of the personnel record is maintained in
the Official Officer Service Records, DOT/CG 626 for active duty officers, the Enlisted Personnel Record System,
DOT/CG 629 for active duty enlisted personnel or the Official Coast Guard Reserve Service Record, OST/CG 576 for inactive
duty reservists. Duplicate magnetic copies of the pay and personnel record are retained at an off site facility for
a useful life of seven years. Paper records for waivers and remissions are retained on site six years three months after
the determination and then destroyed. Paper records to determine legal sufficiency for garnishment are retained
on site six years three months after the member separates from the service or the garnishment is terminated and then
destroyed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for Saipan International Airport
are in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150 effective February 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 103 of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which depict noncompatible
land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations, and the ways in
which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation with interested
and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by the Commonwealth
Ports Authority. The specific maps under consideration are Figures 4&hyph;1 and 6&hyph;2 in the submission. The
FAA has determined that these maps for Saipan International Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements.
This determination is effective on February 14, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure
maps is limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A
of FAR part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or
a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the maps depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act.
FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under &sect;150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Technical Standard Order (TSO) is being revised to incorporate standards for Global Positioning System (GPS)
technology into the standards for multi-sensor navigation systems. In December 1992, TSO&hyph;C129 was issued
to provide minimum operational standards for GPS navigation equipment. This TSO established requirements on multi-sensor
equipment that uses GPS as a navigation source. This revision to TSO&hyph;C115a incorporates those criteria in the
multi-sensor standard. No new criteria have been established by these changes. This revision incorporates only
previously published standards into this TSO.

Notice is hereby given that the Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN) has submitted a petition requesting that
the use of ``Bulldog'' Clamps be approved for an additional two years. BN had previously been granted a waiver of the
requirements of portions of the Track Safety Standards (49 CFR part 213) to allow the carrier to apply Bulldog Clamps
to certain internal rail defects in lieu of conventional rail joint bars on certain BN line segments. See 55 FR 50266
and 56 FR 13515. BN is presently required to remove the clamp within five days of its application to the rail. If the internal
defect has not been removed in that time, bolted joint bars have to be applied. In its petition, BN also requests that
the five day period be increased to twenty days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

FRA is seeking information and comments from all interested parties and are invited to participate in this proceeding
through written submissions. FRA does not anticipate scheduling an opportunity for oral comment because the facts
do not appear to warrant it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All written communications concerning this petition should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver
Petition Docket Number RST&hyph;93&hyph;3) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief

in the Los Angeles, California area, a transportation emergency now exists. To alleviate this situation SCAX has
arranged to lease 25 bi-level passenger cars and 7 power cars from GO Transit of Toronto, Ontario. The SCAX presently
operates 94 bi-level cars over Metrolink, a regional rail network which links downtown Los Angeles and surrounding
counties. The GO Transit cars are nearly identical to the 94 cars purchased by SCAX. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SCAX seeks waivers of compliance from certain sections of the Federal Railroad Administration regulations which
are described herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

FRA Docket Number SA&hyph;94&hyph;2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SCAX is requesting that it be permitted to operate 25 GO Transit bi-level commuter passenger cars and 7 power cars
which do not fully comply with the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR part 231). Section 231.14(b)(2) (``Passenger-train
cars without platforms'') requires that the top tread of the sill step have a minimum clear depth of 8 inches. Section
231.14(c)(3) requires that the side corner handholds be located specifically in relation to the center line of the
coupler. SCAX says that these safety appliances may not be properly configured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA Docket Number RSGM&hyph;94&hyph;3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SCAX seeks a temporary waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR part
223) for 25 GO Transit passenger cars and 7 power cars. The glazing material installed in the equipment is manufactured
to CSA-D263&hyph;1972 (ANSI Z.26.1) standards, laminated safety glass suitable for locomotives and railway cars.
The side facing and end facing glazing material is not in compliance with 49 CFR 223.15.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA Docket Number RST&hyph;94&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SCAX is requesting a waiver of compliance from the requirements of &sect;213.57(b) of the Track Safety Standards
(49 CFR part 213). Section 213.57(b) limits the operation of trains on curved track to speeds which produce no more
than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three 3 inches of underbalance. SCAX requests a waiver to operate their passenger equipment at curving speeds producing
no more than four 4 inches of underbalance. SCAX maintains that curving speeds producing 4 inches of underbalance
still provides a large measure of safety for passenger train operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the transportation emergency existing in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Los Angeles area, FRA has, on a temporary basis, conditionally waived compliance with the relevant portions of the
rail safety regulations. FRA has, however, reserved the right to withdraw such approval upon receipt by FRA of public
comment raising substantial issues of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written reviews, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comments, they should notify FRA, in
writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number SA&hyph;94&hyph;3) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Chief Counsel, Federal
Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications received
before March 29, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will
be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for
examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.&hyph;5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) hereby gives notice that the information collected on the schedule CMR will
not be available to the public. Schedule CMR replaced the previous schedule MR. This action is being taken pursuant

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 5(v) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1464(v), each savings association is required to make
reports of condition to the OTS in a form prescribed by OTS. Section 5(v) further requires that such reports and all
of the information they contain be available to the public unless the Director determines that public disclosure
of a particular item would not protect the safety or soundness of a particular institution or institutions or the Savings
Association Insurance Fund, or would not otherwise be in the public interest. If the Director restricts disclosure
of any item for savings associations generally, that fact and the reason therefor are to be disclosed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 7, 1990, the OTS gave notice that certain information collected on the Thrift Financial Report (TFR) would
not be publicly disclosed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In that notice, OTS specifically discussed maturity/repricing/rate information collected on Schedule MR and used
to measure interest rate risk. The agency indicated that it would be premature and misleading to release such information
at that time, because it was in the process of expanding and enhancing its collection and analysis of such data. OTS
anticipated that after such enhancements were complete, it might be appropriate to disclose this interest-rate-risk
related schedule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since that time, OTS has issued an interest-rate-risk regulation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and has replaced Schedule MR with Schedule CMR. As that regulation and schedule have evolved, it has become apparent
to the agency that releasing the information collected on Schedule CMR would not be in the public interest and would
be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the thrift industry.

58 FR 45799 (Aug. 31, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OTS uses the information collected on Schedule CMR to monitor the interest-rate-risk profiles of both individual
thrifts and the entire industry. Under the new regulation, however, small (under $300 million in assets), highly
capitalized (a risk-based capital ratio in excess of 12 percent) institutions are generally not required to file
Schedule CMR. This exemption covers well over half of the industry. OTS exempted these institutions from the filing
requirements applicable to other savings associations because it believed that they generally held sufficient
capital against potential interest rate risk. OTS encourages these savings associations to voluntarily file Schedule
CMR with the agency to enable it to measure the industry's overall interest rate risk more accurately. The OTS can then
provide these institutions with an assessment of their interest rate risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Making Schedule CMR data publicly available could have several adverse consequences. First, the publication of
data from only those required to file Schedule CMR would give a distorted view of the industry's interest rate risk
profile because such a large portion of the industry is exempt from filing this schedule of the TFR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, OTS is concerned that if Schedule CMR data from individual institutions were made publicly available, current
and potential voluntary filers would be far less likely to file Schedule CMR. In fact, a number of institutions have
indicated that they will not file Schedule CMR voluntarily if the information is disclosed publicly. They have indicated
that information on Schedule CMR has competitive significance. In particular, these institutions are concerned
that disclosure would allow their competitors to gain access to important financial information about their portfolios,
pricing strategies, and risk exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such voluntarily filing thrifts chose not to file Schedule CMR, OTS's ability to measure the interest rate risk
of these institutions would be severely hampered. Because understanding and effectively managing interest rate
risk has historically been, and remains, of critical importance to a healthy thrift industry, OTS believes it is in
the public interest to encourage, not discourage, voluntary reporting of Schedule CMR data by otherwise exempt savings
associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, if the data from only mandatory filers were made publicly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available, such institutions would be competitively disadvantaged in comparison not only to exempt thrifts, but
also to commercial banks and state-chartered savings banks, who are not required to file similar data with their regulators.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the OTS has determined not to make publicly available the data of individual institutions reported
on Schedule CMR. The agency, however, does intend to make publicly available aggregate CMR data for selected industry
peer groups.

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520). Information on
the estimated public reporting burden was provided for public comment in a separate notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 17, 1994 (59 FR 8012). The Department expects that a control number will be issued by OMB about March 22,
1994, after completion of a 30-day comment period for the paperwork burden notice. The OMB control number, when assigned,
will be announced by separate notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No person may be subjected to a penalty for failure to comply with the information collection requirements until they
have been approved and assigned an OMB control number. The public reporting burden for the collection of information
requirements contained in the February 17 notice is estimated to include the time for reviewing the instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. The February 17 notice invites interested persons to submit comments on the paperwork burden proposals
to Joseph F. Lackey, Jr., OMB Desk Officer, Office of Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503.

I. Purpose and Substantive Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437t) provides for the establishment of Family Investment
Centers (FIC). Implementing regulations for the program will be promulgated as part of a consolidated rule on resident
initiatives, which the Department anticipates publishing next year. This NOFA is being issued in conformity with
the statutory requirements before the final rule is in place in order to make funding available as soon as possible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Allocation Amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Act, 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389, approved October 6, 1992), Congress appropriated $25 million for Family Investment
Centers; an additional $25,674,991 is available for the program through an appropriation in the Departments of Veterans
Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124,
approved October 28, 1993). These amounts are being combined with excess recaptured funds carried over from FY 1993
to make a total of $75 million available for funding Family Investment Center activities. An additional $10 million
may become available pending Secretarial and congressional actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the $75 million total current funds, $74 million is being made available under this NOFA. The Department intends
to use $1 million for purposes of demonstrating ways for families living in public and Indian housing in a neighborhood
undergoing a concentrated effort of local revitalization to gain access to education and employment activities
to achieve self-sufficiency and independence, by enabling HAs to develop facilities for training and support services.
These funds will be used to mobilize public and private resources to expand and improve delivery of services, to provide
funding for essential training and support services that cannot otherwise be funded, to improve the capacity of management
to assess the training and services needs of eligible families, to coordinate the provision of training and services
that meet such needs and to ensure the long-term provision of such training and services. HUD expects that this funding
will demonstrate the importance of comprehensive support services in contributing to the local neighborhood revitalization.
A separate Notice announcing these funds and soliciting public comment is expected to be published soon in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the program is implemented on a broad, nationwide basis, each applicant may submit only one application
under this NOFA (published: February 28, 1994. A public housing agency/Indian housing authority (collectively,
HAs) may apply to establish one or more Family Investment Centers for more than one public or Indian housing development;
however the maximum grant amount per applicant under this NOFA is $1 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Overview and Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The stated purpose of section 22 is: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]o provide families living in public housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities to
achieve self-sufficiency and independence by: (a) developing facilities in or near public housing for training
and support services; (b) mobilizing public and private resources to expand and improve the delivery of such services;
(c) providing funding for such essential training and support services that cannot otherwise be funded; and (d) improving
the capacity of management to assess the training and service needs of families, coordinate the provision of training
and services that meet such needs, and ensure the long-term provision of such training and services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although Section 22 is phrased in terms of families living in public housing, the program is also available to Indian
Housing Authorities (IHAs), because of section 527 of the National Affordable Housing Act (104 Stat. 4216; 42 U.S.C.
1437aa note) (NAHA). Section 527 extends the applicability of many NAHA provisions affecting Title I of the 1937 Act
(including section 515, which added Section 22) to housing operated by an IHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIC provides funding to HAs to access educational, housing, or other social service programs to assist public and
Indian housing residents toward self-sufficiency. On May 13, 1993, 33 representatives from public/Indian housing
authorities, resident organizations, and nonprofit housing agencies were convened to discuss and make suggestions
during the design stage of the Family Investment Centers program. The Department envisions that FIC will complement
other self-sufficiency activities, such as the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) Program (see 58 FR 30858 (May 27, 1993)
for the interim rule that currently governs the FSS programs) and the requirements of Section 3 of the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u). As an incentive to become self-sufficient, the earnings of public or Indian
Housing families participating in the FIC shall not be treated as income for the purposes of any other program or provision
of State or Federal law, including rent assistance (see Section I.F(5) of this NOFA). The FIC is administered by the
Department's Office of Resident Initiatives in the Office of Public and Indian Housing, with assistance from a network
of Resident Initiatives Coordinators (RICs) in HUD's Regional and Field Offices.

Eligible Applicants.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Funding for this program is limited to public and Indian housing authorities. The factors for award reflect that more
than half of the points possible are for the provision of supportive services, whether provided by the HA or through
partnerships with other social service agencies. Facilities assisted shall be on or near the premises of public or
Indian housing. Two or more HAs may apply jointly if they demonstrate that it is feasible to run the program together;
however, the maximum grant per application under this NOFA is $1,000,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the program is intended to benefit public and Indian housing residents, an applicant that is otherwise eligible
and is combining FIC activities with FSS activities may use FIC funds to serve both HA residents and section 8 families
who are participating in the FSS Program. For all other families using FIC services, costs incurred are to be borne
by other resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible under this NOFA, a HA cannot have serious unaddressed, outstanding Inspector General audit findings
or fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring review findings or Field Office management review findings. In
addition, the HA must be in compliance with civil rights laws and equal opportunity requirements. A HA will be considered
to be in compliance if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) As a result of formal administrative proceedings, there are no outstanding findings of noncompliance with civil
rights laws unless the HA is operating in compliance with HUD-approved compliance agreement designed to correct
the area(s) of noncompliance;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) There is no adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against it by a private individual,
unless the HA demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order, or implementing a HUD-approved resident
selection and assignment plan or compliance agreement, designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) There is no deferral of Federal funding based upon civil rights violations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) HUD has not deferred application processing by HUD under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Attorney General's
Guidelines (28 CFR 50.3) and HUD's Title VI regulations (24 CFR 1.8) and procedures (HUD Handbook 8040.1) [PHAs only]
or under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD regulations (24 CFR 8.57) [PHAs and IHAs];
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) There is no pending civil rights suit brought against the HA by the Department of Justice; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) There is no unresolved charge of discrimination against the HA issued by the Secretary under section 810(g) of
the Fair Housing Act, as implemented by 24 CFR 103.400.

Resident Involvement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has a longstanding policy of encouraging HAs to promote resident involvement, and to facilitate cooperative
partnerships to achieve specific and mutual goals. Therefore, residents must be included in the planning and implementation
of this program. The HA shall develop a process that assures that RC/RMC/RO representatives and residents are fully
briefed and have an opportunity to comment on the proposed content of the HA's application in response to this NOFA.
The HA shall give full consideration to the comments and concerns of the residents. The process shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Informing residents of the selected developments regarding the preparation of the application, and providing

Training/Employment/Contracting of HA Residents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (a) Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u) (Section 3) requires that programs
of direct financial assistance administered by HUD provide, to the greatest extent feasible, opportunities for
job training and employment to lower income residents in connection with projects in their neighborhoods. For purposes
of training and employment, the HA may offer opportunities to Section 3 residents in the following priority: (i) Residents
of the housing development for which the assistance is being provided; (ii) residents who reside within a project
area as defined in 24 CFR 135.15 and who reside in developments managed by the HA that is expending the assistance; and
(iii) other residents of the Section 3 area. Therefore, at a minimum each HA and each of its contractors and subcontractors
receiving funds under this program shall make best efforts to employ HA residents to provide services and renovation
or conversion work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For purposes of the requirements under Section 3, a best effort means that the HA shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Attempt to recruit HA residents from the appropriate areas through local advertising media, signs placed at the
proposed FIC project site, and community organizations and public or private institutions operating within the
development area. The HA shall include in its outreach and marketing efforts, procedures to attract the least likely
to apply for this program because it includes construction/renovation type of activities, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 low-income households headed by women and persons with disabilities; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Determine the qualifications of HA residents when they apply, either on their own or on referral from any source,
and employ HA residents if their qualifications are satisfactory and the contractor has openings. If the HA is unable
to employ residents determined to be qualified, those residents shall be listed for the first available openings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 22(i) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act), no service provided to a HA resident
under this program may be treated as income for the purpose of any other program or provision of State, Tribal, or Federal
law. Program participation shall begin on the first day the resident enters training or begins to receive services.
Furthermore, the earnings of and benefits to any HA resident resulting from participation in the FIC program shall
not be considered as income in computing the tenant's total annual income that is used to determine the tenant rental
payment during: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

G. Ranking Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each application for grant award will be evaluated if it is submitted as required under Section II.B of this NOFA and
meets the eligibility requirements in Section I.E of this NOFA. Applications submitted for funds that include renovation,
conversion, or combination of dwelling unit activities will be competitively selected based on the highest scores
out of a possible 135 points. Applications submitted for funds solely to implement supportive services will be competitively
selected based on the highest scores out of a possible 140 points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initially, HUD will distribute funds geographically in order to seek diversity through an appropriate mix of public
and Indian housing authorities. Grants will be awarded to the two highest ranked eligible applicants in each funding
category per HUD region. In addition, grants will be awarded to the two highest ranked eligible IHA applications in
each funding category on a nationwide basis. All of the remaining applications will then be placed in overall nationwide
ranking order, with the remaining funds granted in order of rank until all funds are awarded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD will review and evaluate the application as follows, according to whether the application seeks funds for supportive
services only or for other activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(Maximum 135 points). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications for funds for these activities will be scored on the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Evidence of the need for supportive services by eligible residents [10 points]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) The extent to which the envisioned renovation, conversion and combination activities are appropriate to facilitate
the provision of FIC services [15 points]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The extent to which each service provider has evidenced that supportive services and other resources will be provided
until at least the later of: (i) five years following the initial receipt of funding under this NOFA; or (ii) one year
following the completion of activities funded under this NOFA [25 points]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The extent to which the HA has demonstrated that it has partnered with residents in the planning phase for the FIC,
and will further include the residents in the implementation phase [15 points]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The extent to which the HA has demonstrated that it will contract with or employ residents to provide services and
conduct conversion and renovation activities [15 points]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Certification that the HA is implementing a FSS program. IHAs, without FSS programs, that have established counseling
programs such as those found in Mutual Help (MH) may provide similar certification [5 points]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The ability of the HA or designated service provider to provide the supportive services [5 points];

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The extent to which the HA has coordinated implementation of the program, including those in target areas such
as Weed and Seed, Distressed, etc., with tribal, State, or local social service agencies [10 points]. In assigning
points for this factor, HUD shall consider the extent of the involvement of those agencies in the development of the
application and their commitment of assistance in the implementation of the FIC. The commitment of these agencies
may be demonstrated through evidence of intent to provide direct financial assistance or other resources, such as
social services (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
counseling and training); the use of public/Indian housing funds available through existing State and local programs;
or other commitments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The extent to which the HA has demonstrated success in modernization activities under the Comprehensive Grant/Comprehensive
Improvement Assistance (CIAP) Programs (see 24 CFR part 968), the extent to which the HA has a good record of maintaining
and operating public housing as determined by the Public Housing Management Assessment Plan (PHMAP) (see 24 CFR part
901) [10 points], and has utilized innovative and workable strategies to improve management (e.g., LEAP, which uses
highly skilled retired military personnel in key management positions); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The extent to which the HA has demonstrated that it will commit to its FIC part of its formula allocation of Comprehensive
Grant Program (CGP) funds for CGP-eligible activities that result in employment, training, and contracting opportunities
for eligible residents [25 points].

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review under the Order. The notice
announces the availability of funds to provide families living in public or Indian housing with better access to education

and job opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency and independence, and, thus, could benefit families significantly.
However, because the impact on families is beneficial, no further review is considered necessary.

E. Section 102 HUD Reform Act: Documentation and Public Access Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

F. Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42
U.S.C. 3537a) became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding
competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection
of successful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is
not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well.
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed
with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters
counsel for the program to which the question pertains.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Section 112 of the Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912). If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they
are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD)
(This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.

H. Freedom of Information Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications submitted in response to this NOFA are subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
To assist the Department in determining whether to release information contained in an application in the event a
FOIA request is received, and applicant may, through clear earmarking, or otherwise, indicate those portions of
its application that it believes should not be disclosed. The applicants's views will be used solely to aid the Department
in preparing its response to a FOIA request; however, the Department is required by the FOIA to make an independent
evaluation of the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD suggests that an applicant provide a basis, when possible, for its belief that confidential treatment is appropriate;
general assertions or blanket requests for confidentiality, without more information, are of limited value to the
Department in making determinations concerning the release of information under FOIA. The Department is required
to segregate disclosable information from nondisclosable items, so an applicant should be careful to identify each
portion of the application for which confidential treatment is requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department emphasizes that the presence or absence of comments or earmarking regarding confidential information
will have no bearing on the evaluation of applications submitted in response to this solicitation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal
contracts, grants or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of the
Federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.
The Department has determined that an IHA established by an Indian Tribe as a result of the exercise of its sovereign
power is not subject to the Byrd Amendment, but an IHA established under State law is subject to those requirements
and prohibitions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The goal of the Eisenhower National Program is to support projects of national significance in elementary and secondary
schools in mathematics and science education designed to improve the skills of teachers and the quality of instruction
in these areas and to increase the access of students to that instruction. The program is authorized under title II,
part A, subpart 1, section 2012 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 12, 1993, the Secretary announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 60007) a proposed priority for the Eisenhower National Program in model professional development in the use
of technology for mathematics and science instruction. Now, after considering the intent of the Senate Report that
accompanied the Fiscal Year 1994 Department of Education Appropriations Act, the Secretary has decided to propose
two additional priorities, announced herein. These priorities will serve (1) to encourage the interest and attainments
of female and minority students in mathematics and science and (2) to improve teacher professional development in
environmental education.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary may subsequently conduct an external study or studies of the effectiveness and lessons learned from
projects funded under this program. If he does so, projects will be required to cooperate with the conduct of the study,
by sharing their experiences, project evaluations, and data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding priority 1, the Secretary is concerned that the Nation's schools encourage too few minority and female
students to study and pursue careers in the fields of mathematics and science. The Secretary believes that the well-documented
underrepresentation of minorities and women in these disciplines represents a waste of human talent that the Nation
can ill afford. This priority would therefore support, and learn from, projects that seek to stimulate and sustain
the interest and attainments of female and minority children in mathematics and science. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding priority 2, the Secretary believes that environmental education can stimulate students' interest in
scientific fields and enhance their understanding of these disciplines. The Secretary also believes that environmental
issues are important in their own right and are, therefore, eminently worthy of study. The Secretary finds, however,
that environmental education programs of high quality are available in too few of the Nation's schools, in part because
American teachers have very limited opportunities to increase their knowledge of environmental issues and to learn
the most successful means of providing environmental education. The Secretary proposes, therefore, to support
and learn from projects in professional development for teachers in environmental education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary draws to the attention of potential applicants responding to priority 2 the National Consortium for
Environmental Education and Training (NCEET) at the University of Michigan, an undertaking funded by the Environmental
Protection Agency under section 5 of the National Environmental Education Act of 1990. NCEET's primary emphasis
is professional development for teachers in environmental education. Potential applicants should consult with
NCEET to ensure that their projects are not duplicative of the National Consortium's efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary will announce the final priorities in a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The final priorities will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations
of the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, the nature of the final priorities,
and the quality of the applications received. The publication of these proposed priorities does not preclude the
Secretary from proposing additional priorities; nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only these priorities,
subject to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.
