 This interim final rule authorizes expenses and establishes assessment rates for the Florida Lime Administrative
Committee and the Avocado Administrative Committee (Committees) under Marketing Orders 911 and 915 for the 1994&hyph;95
fiscal year. The Committees are responsible for local administration of the marketing orders which regulate the
handling of Florida limes and avocados. Authorization of these budgets enables the Committees to incur expenses
that are reasonable and necessary to administer their respective programs. Funds to administer these programs are
derived from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 911 [7 CFR part 911], as amended, regulating
the handling of limes grown in Florida; and Marketing Agreement and Order No. 915 [7 CFR part 915] regulating the handling
of avocados grown in Florida. These agreements and orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, limes and avocados grown in Florida are subject to assessments. It is intended that
the assessment rates as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable Florida limes and avocados handled during
the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, beginning April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt
any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 45 handlers of limes grown in Florida, and approximately 40 producers in the regulated area
who are subject to regulation under the lime marketing order. Also, there are approximately 65 handlers of avocados
grown in Florida, and approximately 95 producers in the regulated area who are subject to regulation under the avocado
marketing order. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of lime and avocado producers and handlers may be classified
as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lime and avocado marketing orders, administered by the Department, require that the assessment rates for a particular
fiscal year apply to all assessable limes and avocados handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses
are prepared by the Committees, the agencies responsible for local administration of their respective marketing
orders, and submitted to the Department for approval. Each Committee consists of producers, handlers and a non-industry
public member. They are familiar with the Committees' needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel
in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The Committees' budgets are formulated
and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide
input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rates recommended by the Committees are derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of limes and avocados (in bushels). Because those rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established
at rates which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committees' expected expenses. The recommended budgets
and rates of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committees shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred
on a continuous basis. Therefore, the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committees
will have funds to pay their expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida Lime Administrative Committee met on December 8, 1993, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 marketing
order expenditures of $89,697 and an assessment rate of $0.16 per 55-pound bushel of limes. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94
marketing year budgeted expenditures were $113,846, which is $24,149 more than the $89,697 recommended for this
fiscal year. The assessment rate of $0.16 per bushel remains the same as last year's assessment rate of $0.16. The major
budget categories for 1994&hyph;95 are $28,000 for administrative staff salaries and $10,100 for employee benefits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated to total $64,000 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments
of 400,000 55-pound bushels of limes. Interest on savings is expected to add an additional $2,000 to income. The assessment
and interest income will have to be augmented by $23,697 from the Committee's reserves to provide adequate funds to
cover budgeted expenses. Sufficient reserve funds are available to cover the projected deficit. Funds in the reserve
at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year are estimated to be $250,000. These reserve funds will be within the maximum
permitted by the order of three fiscal years' expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Avocado Administrative Committee also met on December 8, 1993, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 marketing
order expenditures of $97,000 and an assessment rate of $0.16 per 55-pound bushel of avocados. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 marketing year budgeted expenditures were $113,846, which is $16,846 more than the
$97,000 recommended for this fiscal year. The assessment rate of $0.16 per bushel remains the same as last year's assessment
rate of $0.16. The major budget categories for 1994&hyph;95 are $28,000 for administrative staff salaries, $15,600
for compliance, and $10,100 for employee benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated to total $96,000 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments
of 600,000 55-pound bushels of avocados. Interest on savings is expected to add an additional $1,000 to income. Sufficient
reserve funds are available to cover any unexpected shortfall in projected income. Funds in the reserve at the end
of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year are estimated to be $100,000. These reserve funds will be within the maximum permitted
by the order of three fiscal years' expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived from the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committees' recommendations, and other
available information, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause

 because: (1) The Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis; (2) the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year begins on April 1, 1994, and the marketing orders require that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal year apply to all assessable limes and avocados handled during the fiscal year; (3) handlers are aware
of this action which was recommended by the Committees at public meetings; and (4) this interim final rule provides
a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes.
This action requires inspections of the brake rod inner cylinder bolts on the main landing gear (MLG) wheels and brakes;
inspections of certain MLG bushings; installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect; inspection and
modification of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel; repair or replacement of discrepant parts; and revision
of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), as necessary. This amendment is prompted by numerous reports of brake failure
during landing and during a low energy rejected takeoff. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure
of two or more MLG brakes, which could adversely affect the stopping performance of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FAA has received reports from Boeing that certain Model 767 series airplanes, equipped with carbon brakes, have
experienced vibratory conditions, which resulted in damage or failure of the brake torque rod cross bolts and pins.
Recently, one operator experienced a two-brake failure on a low energy rejected takeoff, whereas previously, there
had been reports of two-brake failures occurring only during landings. To date, there have been 13 reported incidents
of one-brake failure and 5 incidents of a two-brake failure, all due to the vibratory phenomenon. This type of failure
could result in the loss of one or two brakes (out of eight total brakes), depending upon the location of the failure.
The possibility exists that more than one brake-couple pair could experience simultaneous failure of the cross bolts
or pins, which could result in the loss of more than two brakes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Boeing has advised the FAA that heat damage resulting from high vibrational loads could lead to fracture of the brake
rod inner cylinder bolts. If this should occur, the adjacent brake rods would disconnect from the inner cylinder,
causing the brakes not to operate at two MLG wheels. As a result, secondary damage to the hydraulic lines and damage
to wiring and the airframe could occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boeing has also advised the FAA that vibrations during braking can lead to separation of the brake disconnect. Separation
of brake hoses from the brakes would increase braking distances, which is of greatest concern if this should happen
during a rejected takeoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, Boeing has advised the FAA that the development of a fracture in a cross bolt in the brake rod pin assembly
could cause the brake not to operate at that MLG wheel. The brake rod could separate from the brake housing, permitting
the brake housing to turn on the axle. Under such conditions, while the wheel turns and brake pressure is applied, rotation
of the brake housing would cut the hydraulic line and electrical wires attached to the brake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These conditions, if not corrected, could adversely affect the stopping performance of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0116, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994,
that describes procedures for repetitive surface temper etch inspections and fluorescent magnetic particle inspections
to detect cracks or thermal damage of the existing brake rod inner cylinder bolts on the MLG wheels and brakes, and replacement
of cracked or damaged bolts with new or serviceable bolts. The service bulletin also describes procedures for performing
repetitive visual inspections to detect cracking of the inner cylinder fork lug bushings, and the brake rod bushings
at the inner cylinder fork lug end, and repair of cracked bushings. Accomplishment of the repetitive inspections,
and replacement or repair as necessary, will help prevent the possibility of a fracture developing in the brake rod
inner cylinder bolts. (The service bulletin limits the effectivity to Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon
brakes.)

The FAA has also reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0125, dated November 11, 1993,
that describes procedures for installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect. The alert service bulletin
also describes procedures for adjustment of the torque of the ``B''-nut on the hydraulic line connection to the disconnect
fitting. Accomplishment of the installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect will provide an improved
installation of the brake disconnect, which keeps the brake hose connected to the brake. (The alert service bulletin
limits the effectivity to Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon brakes, line positions 132 through 518,
inclusive.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has also reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0126, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994,
that describes procedures for performing a visual inspection of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel to detect
cracks, bronze transfer, corrosion, chrome discoloration, and areas of missing chrome plate; replacement of any
damaged brake rod pin assembly; modification of the brake rod pin assembly; installation of the modified brake rod
pin into the brake housing and brake rod; and installation of a new brake attach pin retainer configuration. The service
bulletin also describes a visual inspection to detect cracking, deformation, and/or missing pieces of material
in the brake housing, and the bushings in the end of the brake rod; and repair or replacement as necessary. Accomplishment
of this inspection and modification of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel, inspection of certain MLG bushings,
and replacement or repair as necessary, will help prevent the possibility of a fracture developing in a cross bolt.
The manufacturer has installed this modification on airplanes (equipped with carbon brakes) in production, starting
at line number 519 and subsequent. (The service bulletin limits the effectivity to Model 767 series airplanes equipped
with carbon brakes, line positions 132 through 518, inclusive.)

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Model 767 series airplanes
of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of two or more MLG brakes, which could adversely affect
the stopping performance of the airplane. This AD requires the following actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

thermal damage of the existing brake rod inner cylinder bolts on the MLG wheels and brakes, and replacement of cracked
or damaged bolts with new or serviceable bolts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Repetitive visual inspections to detect cracking of the inner cylinder fork lug bushings and the brake rod bushings
at the inner cylinder fork lug end; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect and adjustment of the torque of the ``B''-nut on the
hydraulic line connection to the disconnect fitting; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A one-time visual inspection of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel to detect cracks, bronze transfer, corrosion,
chrome discoloration, and areas of missing chrome plate; replacement of any damaged brake rod pin assembly with a
new or serviceable assembly; modification of the brake rod pin assembly; installation of the modified brake rod pin
into the brake housing and brake rod; and installation of a new brake attach pin retainer configuration; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A one-time visual inspection to detect cracking, deformation, and/or missing pieces in the bushings in the brake
housing, and the bushings in the end of the brake rod; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Subsequent repair or replacement of any cracked and/or deformed bushings, and/or any bushings having missing
pieces of material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This AD allows operation with one-brake-deactivated performance decrements for cracked or broken bushings, for
operators who comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD within the acceptable compliance
timeframe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD allows operation with two-brake-deactivated performance decrements, for operators who have not accomplished
the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD within the acceptable compliance timeframe. For those
operators, this AD requires revising the Limitations and Flight Performance Sections of the Airplane Flight Manual
(AFM) to include two-brake-deactivated performance decrements. Three options are provided: the first and second
options are simple, conservative corrections; the third option, while more complicated, can provide a less penalizing
correction, depending upon the conditions. The effect of this AD is to ensure that flight crews are advised of the potential
hazard and of the procedures to address it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicability of this AD is limited to only Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon brakes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed Model 382, 382B,
382E, 382F, and 382G series airplanes. This action requires inspections to detect loose, missing, or deformed fasteners
in the upper truss mounts of certain engines, inspections to detect cracking in the associated tangs, and replacement
of damaged parts with new or serviceable parts. This amendment is prompted by a report of fatigue cracking of the upper
tang of the truss mounts. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent multiple failures of the upper truss
mounts due to the problems associated with fatigue cracking, which could adversely affect the integrity of the engine
mount structure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recently, the operator of Lockheed Model C&hyph;130 (military) series airplanes reported that, during routine
maintenance inspections, the truss mounts on the upper tangs on the outboard engines of several airplanes were found
to be cracked. These airplanes had accumulated between 9,000 and 14,000 total hours time-in-service. Since these
military airplanes are typically subjected to more rigorous flight operations (such as low level penetration, air
drop, and soft landings during training missions) than their civilian aircraft counterparts, the fatigue life of
the components on these military airplanes are affected more adversely. These findings of cracking, which have been
attributed to fatigue, were found in the upper attach fittings between the engine truss mounts and the front wing spars.
This cracking occurred in the tangs that penetrate the front wing spars and progressed to the point of overload failure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similar cracking was also found on a civilian Model 382G series airplane that had accumulated approximately 23,000
total hours time-in-service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Complete fracture of a single upper truss mount would not adversely affect the fail-safe structure of the airplane;
however, the effect on the fatigue life of the remaining upper truss mount is unknown at this time. Additional failures
of the upper truss mount, if not corrected, could adversely affect the integrity of the engine mount structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The engine mountings on the military Model C&hyph;130 and the civilian Model 382G series airplanes are identical
in design to the mountings on civilian Model 382, 382B, 382E, and 382F series airplanes on which the outer wings have
been replaced in accordance with Manufacturing End Product (MEP) 12R/13R or MEP 9T/10T. Although cracking has not
been found on these specific civilian airplanes, the FAA has determined that those airplanes could be subject to the
same type of fatigue cracking in the subject engine mounts that was found in the military airplanes and in the civilian
Model 382G series airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, although cracking has been detected only on the engine mounts of the number one engine, the FAA has determined
that fatigue could similarly stress the engine mountings of both outboard (number one and number four) engines, and
that consequent fatigue cracking is likely to occur on the mountings of both engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Lockheed Alert Service Bulletin A382&hyph;71&hyph;19&hyph;A82&hyph;687, dated
December 23, 1993, that describes procedures for inspections to detect loose, missing, or deformed fasteners, and
cracking of the upper tangs of the truss mounts on the outboard engines.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Lockheed Model 382, 382B,
382E, 382F, and 382G series airplanes of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent multiple failures
of the upper truss mounts, which could adversely affect the integrity of the engine mount structure. This AD requires
repetitive general visual inspections to detect loose, missing, or deformed fasteners on the inboard and outboard
upper truss mounts of the number one and number four (left and right outboard) engines, and repetitive general visual
inspections to detect cracking in the upper tangs of the truss mounts of these engines. The actions are required to
be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD also requires replacement of loose, missing, or deformed fasteners with new or serviceable fasteners, and
replacement of cracked truss mount upper tangs with new or serviceable tangs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ``

ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be
amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions
is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking
action would be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;04&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``

 on September 10, 1993. That final rule removed Boise, ID, from the description of J&hyph;54 to improve existing air
traffic control (ATC) route continuity on frequently used high altitude routes. However, during recent flight checks
of J&hyph;54, it was determined that Boise, ID, should be reinstated and the jet route segment from Cherokee, WY, to
Laramie, WY, should be removed due to lack of frequency protection in the extended service volume. This action reflects
the restoration of Boise, ID, and the removal of the jet route segment from Cherokee, WY, to Laramie, WY, in the description
of J&hyph;54.

On September 10, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule that alters several jet routes
located in Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, and Oregon to coincide with the scheduled
opening date of the new Denver International Airport (58 FR 47633). However, during recent flight checks of jet route
J&hyph;54, it was determined that Boise, ID, should be reinstated and the jet route segment from Cherokee, WY, to Laramie,
WY, should be removed due to lack of frequency protection in the extended service volume. This action reflects the
reinstatement of Boise, ID, and the removal of the segment from Cherokee, WY, to Laramie, WY, in the description of

This amendment adopts miscellaneous amendments to the required IFR (instrument flight rules) altitudes and changeover
points for certain Federal airways, jet routes, or direct routes for which a minimum or maximum en route authorized
IFR altitude is prescribed. This regulatory action is needed because of changes occurring in the National Airspace
System. These changes are designed to provide for the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace under instrument
conditions in the affected areas.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to Part 95 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 95) amends, suspends, or revokes IFR altitudes
governing the operation of all aircraft in flight over a specified route or any portion of that route, as well as the
changeover points (COPs) for Federal airways, jet routes, or direct routes as prescribed in Part 95. The specified
IFR altitudes, when used in conjunction with the prescribed changeover points for those routes, ensure navigation
aid coverage that is adequate for safe flight operations and free of frequency interference. The reasons and circumstances
that create the need for this amendment involve matters of flight safety and operational efficiency in the National
Airspace System, are related to published aeronautical charts that are essential to the user, and provide for the
safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace. In addition, those various reasons or circumstances require making
this amendment effective before the next scheduled charting and publication date of the flight information to assure
its timely availability to the user. The effective date of this amendment reflects those considerations. In view
of the close and immediate relationship between these regulatory changes and safety in air commerce, I find that notice
and public procedure before adopting this amendment are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public
interest and that good cause exists for making the amendment effective in less than 30 days. The FAA has determined
that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments
are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order
12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979);
and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same
reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Agreement Implementation Act (Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 437 (December 8, 1993)).

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 110) on January 3, 1994, contains the interim regulations that represent fulfillment of the obligations of
the United States under Paragraph 1 of Annex 311 of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as implemented
under the North American Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 437 (December
8, 1993)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document corrects some errors published in T.D. 94&hyph;4, which did not represent a proper transcription from
the final version of edited drafts of the rules. Accordingly, some changes are made to remedy these transcription
errors. (An example of a transcription error was the inadvertent omission of many tariff shift rules in &sect;102.20(f)).
Other changes, also, are necessary to correct typographical errors, which if left uncorrected can have the effect
of changing the meaning of a specific provision. None of these corrections, however, represent a change of position
by Customs with respect to any of the rules published in T.D. 94&hyph;4.

&sect;102.20. Of special note is the definition of ``material'', another term that is used throughout this part.
Under paragraph (l), the term, ``material'' is defined as including ``parts'', ``ingredients'', ``subassemblies'',

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is amending its rules of practice and procedure to conform with the North American Free Trade Agreement
Implementation Act, Pub. L. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057 (December 8, 1993) (``NAFTA Implementation Act''). In
particular, these interim regulations implement title III of the NAFTA Implementation Act, which provides for special
safeguard investigations and determinations with respect to Canadian and Mexican articles during the transition
period for tariff elimination under the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA''), provide for certain findings
with respect to Canadian and Mexican articles in the course of an investigation under section 202 of the Trade Act of
1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252), make certain conforming changes to section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to treatment
of confidential business information, and direct the Commission to ``adopt such procedures and rules and regulations
as are necessary to bring its procedures into conformity with chapter 8 of the Agreement.'' These interim regulations
also implement title IV of the NAFTA Implementation Act, which provides for issuance of administrative protective
orders for information required to be released in review by a binational panel of United States antidumping and countervailing
duty final determinations involving products from Canada or Mexico.

A. Part 206 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chapter 8 of the NAFTA sets out the procedures and remedies available to domestic industries that have sustained,
or are threatened by, serious economic injury due to increased imports. Chapter 8 covers two different situations_actions
that can be taken against increased imports from a single NAFTA country due to injury caused by the phase-out of tariffs
under the NAFTA (``bilateral'' actions) and those that can be taken against imports from all sources (``global''
actions). In general, such bilateral actions may be taken during specified ``transition periods'' during which
duties on NAFTA-origin goods are being phased out. When taking global actions, NAFTA countries are called upon to
exclude goods originating in other NAFTA countries from the action when they are not a significant cause of the problem.
However, NAFTA imports initially excluded may be subsequently included if a surge in such imports is found to undermine
the effectiveness of the relief action. In several respects, the chapter tracks the emergency action provisions
in Chapter 11 of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (``CFTA'') for both bilateral and global actions,
while adding Mexico to, and making certain changes in, the CFTA rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 8 of the NAFTA goes beyond Chapter 11 of the CFTA in several respects. The chapter establishes procedural rules
similar to those in current U.S. law and practice that each government will be required to follow in conducting investigations
leading to bilateral and global safeguard actions against goods from other NAFTA countries. These rules require,
among other things, the publication of notice of an investigation and its scope, the holding of a public hearing, protection
of confidential information, and publication of findings and the basis for those findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title III of the NAFTA Implementation Act (1) provides for special safeguard investigations and determinations
by the Commission with respect to Canadian and Mexican articles during the transition period of the Agreement; (2)
provides for Commission findings in the context of a global action safeguard investigation under section 202 of the
Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252) to assist the President in determining whether imports from Canada or Mexico should
be excluded from the relief action; and (3), if imports from Canada and/or Mexico are excluded from the action, provides
for Commission investigations and findings with respect to whether there has been a surge in such excluded imports
which undermines the effectiveness of the relief action. Title III also makes certain conforming changes to section
202 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252) with respect to treatment of confidential business information. Section
317 of the NAFTA Implementation Act directs the Commission to ``adopt such procedures and rules and regulations as
are necessary to bring its procedures into conformity with chapter 8 of the Agreement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since August 29, 1988, the Commission has had in effect interim rules governing the Commission's administrative
responsibilities under sections 201&hyph;204 and 406 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2251&hyph;2254,
2436). See 53 FR 33036, Aug. 29, 1988. The amendments to these rules provide procedures for Commission investigations
and determinations with respect to imports from Canada or Mexico during the transition period of the Agreement; for
Commission findings in the context of a global action safeguard investigation under sections 201&hyph;202 of the
Trade Act of 1974 to assist the President in determining whether imports from Canada or Mexico should be excluded from
the relief action; and, if imports from Canada and/or Mexico are excluded from the action, for Commission investigations
and findings with respect to whether there has been a surge in such excluded imports which undermines the effectiveness
of the relief action. The amendments also set out Commission procedures regarding the protection of confidential
business information, and make certain technical changes to bring the rules into conformity with chapter 8 of NAFTA.
No changes except with respect to numbering were made to rules specifically relating to the Commission's administrative
responsibilities under sections 204 and 406 of the Trade Act. These amended interim rules are intended to replace
the existing rules as of January 1, 1994.

B. Subpart G of Part 207 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chapter 19 of the NAFTA establishes a mechanism for resolving disputes between any two of the NAFTA countries with
respect to antidumping and countervailing duty cases. The central feature of the mechanism is the replacement of
domestic judicial review of determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports from
another NAFTA country with review by binational panels. The NAFTA countries will continue to apply their own national
antidumping and countervailing duty laws to goods imported from the other country. In such cases, binational panels,
consisting of five panelists chosen by the countries involved in the dispute, will expeditiously review final determinations
under these laws to decide whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country
that made the determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAFTA also provides for review of a panel decision by an extraordinary challenge committee (``Committee'') when
the government of one of the NAFTA countries alleges that a panelist materially violated the rules of conduct, or that
the panel seriously departed from a fundamental procedural rule or exceeded its powers, authority or jurisdiction.
The NAFTA requires that the NAFTA countries protect sensitive business information against unlawful disclosure
in both the panel review and extraordinary challenge processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV of the NAFTA Implementation Act amends U.S. law to implement chapter 19 of the NAFTA by limiting judicial review
in cases involving Canadian or Mexican merchandise, establishing procedures whereby private parties may appeal
for binational panel review, providing organizational structure for administering U.S. responsibilities under
chapter 19 and making other conforming amendments to U.S. law. More specifically, section 402(g) of the NAFTA Implementation
Act authorizes the Commission to issue regulations to implement chapter 19 of the NAFTA, including extraordinary
challenge committee proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations are intended to implement certain administrative procedures required by chapter 19 of the Agreement
involving administrative responsibilities of the Commission that continue during and after panel review. The regulations
address release of business proprietary and privileged information under administrative protective order during
a panel review, and sanctions for violations of the provisions of such protective orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since January 1, 1989, the Commission has had in effect either interim or final rules governing the Commission's administrative
responsibilities under the U.S.-Canada Free-Trade Implementation Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;449 (September
28, 1988) (``CFTA Implementation Act''). See 53 FR 53248, Dec. 30, 1988 (interim); 54 FR 36295, Sept. 1, 1989 (interim);
and 57 FR 34825, Aug. 6, 1992 (final). The amended interim rules issued herein, which govern the Commission's administrative
responsibilities under the NAFTA Implementation Act, for the most part track the existing rules applicable under
the CFTA Implementation Act. Unless otherwise noted, these rules are technical in nature, for example, replacing
references to Canada with references to the NAFTA country or references to the CFTA Agreement with references to the
NAFTA agreement. These amended interim rules are intended to replace the existing rules as of January 1, 1994.

of public comment on the proposed rules; (3) Commission review of such comments prior to developing final rules; and
(4) publication of the final rules thirty days prior to their effective date. See 5 U.S.C. 553. That procedure could
not be utilized in this instance because the new legislation was enacted on December 8, 1993, and became effective
on January 1, 1994. Thus, it was not possible to complete the standard procedure prior to that date. The Commission
thus determined to adopt interim rules that go into effect as of January 1, 1994 and will remain in effect until the Commission
can adopt final rules promulgated in accordance with the usual notice, comment, and advance publication procedure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the requirement in the NAFTA Implementation Act that Commission rules be amended by the effective date
of the legislation, the Commission's authority to adopt interim rules without following all steps listed in section
553 of the APA is derived from two sources: (1) Section 335 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1335) and (2) provisions
of section 553 of the APA which allow an agency to dispense with various steps in the prescribed rule making procedures
under certain circumstances. The Commission has determined that the statutory requirement to have rules in place
by the effective date of the NAFTA constitutes appropriate circumstances to forego the steps listed in section 553
of the APA. Specifically, the Commission has determined that the requirement that amended rules take effect as of
January 1, 1994 makes the notice, comment and advance publication procedure impracticable in this instance and that
the amended interim rules constitute agency rules of procedure and practice for which notice of proposed rule making
is not required. Further, the Commission has determined that the requirement that amended rules be in place by the
enactment date of the legislation constitutes good cause to publish interim rules without providing thirty days
notice prior to their effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has also determined that these rules do not constitute major rules for the purposes of Executive Order
12291 (46 FR 13193, Feb. 17, 1981), because they do not meet the criteria described in section 1(b) of the EO. Finally,
the amendments, as interim rules, are not subject to the filing requirement of section 3(c)(3) of the EO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to these rules because they do not affect a large number of small entities,
and because the rules were not required by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act or by any other law to be promulgated
as a proposed rule before issuance as a final rule.

Explanation of Proposed Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendments to Part 206 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The title of part 206 is changed to refer to, among other things, ``global and bilateral safeguard actions,'' reflecting
the use of the term ``safeguards'' in the NAFTA Implementation Act and to distinguish between actions with respect
to imports from all countries (proceedings under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974) and actions with respect to imports
from a NAFTA country (proceedings under section 302(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act). The current title of this
part refers to, among other things, ``investigations relating to import injury to industries.'' The current title,
which historically has been used to refer to section 201-type proceedings, can be confusing to those not familiar
with Commission trade law terminology and has been misconstrued as describing proceedings under other statutory
provisions that the Commission administers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.1 is amended to state that part 206 applies to functions and duties of the Commission under sections 301&hyph;318
of the NAFTA Implementation Act and to state that subparts C and D of the rules apply to requests/petitions and investigations
under sections 312(c) and 302 of that Act, respectively. Former subparts C and D (relating to market disruption investigations
under section 406 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2436) and monitoring and advice under section 204 of the Trade Act
of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2254), respectively) are redesignated as subparts E and F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.2, which provides for the identification of petitions, is amended to include references to sections
312(c) and 302 of the NAFTA Implementation Act in the list of statutory provisions under which petitions under this
part may be filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.3 is divided into three subsections and amended to describe the information that the Commission is to
include in a notice when it institutes an investigation, and to state that the Commission will promptly make the petition
or request available for public inspection (with the exception of confidential business information). This latter
amendment conforms the Commission rules to paragraphs 4 and 5 of NAFTA Annex 803.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.4 is amended to state that the Commission will also transmit copies of requests (relating to a surge in
imports from a NAFTA country) to the USTR and certain other agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.5, concerning public hearings, is divided into three subsections and amended to distinguish between
investigations under subpart B, in which the Commission is required to hold separate hearings on injury and remedy,
and investigations under subparts C, D, and E, in which the Commission holds only one hearing on both issues, to the
extent appropriate. Additional language states that interested parties and consumers, including any association
representing the interests of consumer, may appear and may cross-question interested parties making presentations
at a hearing; this latter amendment conforms the rule to section 7(b) of NAFTA Annex 803.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.6, concerning the Commission's report to the President, simplifies the existing description and also
states that the Commission will include, in the case of a report containing a determination under section 302(b) of
the NAFTA Implementation Act, certain findings with respect to factors other than imports that may be a cause of serious
injury or threat thereof. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.7, states that the Commission, in the case of an investigation under subparts B, C, or D of this part, will
not release information considered to be confidential business information unless the party submitting the information
had notice, at the time of submission, that such information would be released by the Commission, or such party subsequently
consents to the release of the information. This rule reflects an amendment made by section 317(b) of the NAFTA Implementation
Act to section 202(a) of the Trade Act. Paragraph 8 of NAFTA Annex 803.3 requires that the investigating authority
in a NAFTA country adopt or maintain procedures for the treatment of confidential information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B, which relates to investigations filed under section 201 of the Trade Act, is retitled ``Investigations
Relating to Global Safeguard Actions'', reflecting in part the change in the title of part 206.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;206.12, the definition of perishable agricultural product is simplified to take into account the fact that
certain monitoring is required by statute (section 316 of the NAFTA Implementation Act). Also, reference is made
to citrus products to reflect the amendment made by section 315 of the NAFTA Implementation Act to section 202(d) of
the Trade Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.14, concerning the contents of petitions, is amended in several minor respects. The introductory paragraph
is amended at the end to provide that the petition is to include certain information ``to the extent that such information
is publicly available from governmental or other sources, or best estimates and the basis therefor if such information
is not available''. This amendment conforms &sect;206.14 with paragraph 3 of NAFTA Annex 803.3. A new paragraph (3)
is added to subsection (e) to state that the petition is to contain data relating to changes in the level of prices, production,
and productivity, also conforming &sect;206.14 with paragraph 3(e) of NAFTA Annex 803.3 regarding the contents
of petitions. Also, a new subsection (i) is added to state that petitions are to include data indicating the share of
imports accounted for by imports from each NAFTA country, and petitioner's view concerning the extent to which such
imports are contributing importantly to the serious injury or threat thereof. This conforms &sect;206.14 with paragraph
3(g) of NAFTA Annex 803.3. Finally, a new subsection (j) is added to set out the dates by which any allegations of critical
circumstances must be included within the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart C is new, and the title states that it pertains to investigations relating to a surge in imports from a NAFTA
country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.21 states that subpart C applies to investigations under section 312(c) of the NAFTA Implementation
Act, which provides for Commission investigations and determinations when there has been a surge in imports of an
article from Canada or Mexico that has been excluded from a U.S. global safeguard action with respect to such article.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.22 defines the term ``surge'' to mean a significant increase in imports over the trend for a recent representative
base period. This definition tracks the definition in section 312(c)(3) of the NAFTA Implementation Act and Article
805 of the NAFTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.23 states that a request for an investigation under this Subpart may be filed by any entity that is representative
of the industry for which the global action is being taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.24 describes the information that a request for an investigation is to contain, including the identity
of the requestor, the article and its tariff provision, the name of the country or countries from which the surge is
coming, information with respect to representativeness, and data and information supporting the allegation that
a surge in imports has occurred and that such surge undermines the effectiveness of the relief action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.25 states that the Commission will submit its findings to the President no later than 30 days after receiving
the request for an investigation, as required by section 312(c)(2) of the NAFTA Implementation Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.26 states that the Commission will make its report to the President available to the public (with the exception
of confidential business information) and cause a summary thereof to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart D is new, and the title states that it pertains to investigations relating to bilateral safeguard actions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.31 states that subpart D applies to investigations under section 302(b) of the NAFTA Implementation
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.32 defines the terms ``critical circumstances'' and ``perishable agricultural product'' in the same
manner as in &sect;206.12 of the rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.33 states who may file a petition. Subsection (a) states that a request for an investigation under this
Subpart may be filed by any entity that is representative of a domestic industry producing an article like or directly
competitive with a Canadian or Mexican article that is allegedly, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty
provided for under the NAFTA, being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions so that imports
of the article alone constitute a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to such industry. Subsection
(b) states who may file a petition with respect to imports from Canada or Mexico of a perishable agricultural product.
Subsection (c) makes reference to the fact that the President is authorized to take a bilateral action with respect
to an article from Canada or Mexico during the appropriate period provided for in section 305(a) of the NAFTA Implementation
Act, or thereafter but only if the Government of Canada or Mexico, as the case may be, consents to such provision (see
section 305(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act). The periods set out in section 305(a) are the transition periods
for tariff elimination in the U.S. schedules in the CFTA and NAFTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.34 describes the information that is to be included in a petition for an investigation. This section generally
tracks &sect;206.14 of these rules concerning contents of petitions, except that the introductory paragraph tracks
the wording of the standard applicable in a bilateral safeguard investigation involving a NAFTA country, the import
data section requires data concerning Canadian or Mexican imports as appropriate, and the statement called for in
&sect;206.14(i) concerning imports from NAFTA countries is not included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.35 implements the time requirements for Commission determinations and reports in section 303(a) and
(c) of the NAFTA Implementation Act, and states that the Commission will make its injury determination within 120
days of the initiation of an investigation, and submit its report to the President no later than 30 days thereafter.
Time requirements for determinations in investigations involving imports of perishable agricultural products
or allegations of critical circumstances are also specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.36 states that the Commission will make its report to the President available to the public (with the exception
of confidential business information) and cause a summary thereof to be published in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subparts E and F, relating to investigations for relief from market disruption, and monitoring and advice as to effect
of extension, reduction, modification, or termination of relief, respectively, are unchanged from previous subparts
C and D. However, the various rule sections have been renumbered to reflect the revised order in part 206.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendments to Subpart G to Part 207 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 207.90 currently indicates that subpart G implements Article 1904 of the CFTA Implementation Act. The amendment
to this section expands the scope of subpart G to cover procedures and regulations for implementation of Article 1904
of the NAFTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 207.91 provides definitions of terms used in subpart G. The definitions of ``Agreement'', ``Article 1904
Rules'' and ``FTA'' have been amended to reflect the change from the CFTA to the NAFTA. The amended definitions also
reflect that, in the event that the United States or Canada withdraws from the NAFTA, the CFTA would still apply to the
United States and Canada, and that these rules would apply to binational panel reviews between those two countries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A definition has been added for ``ECC Rules'', and references to these rules have been added to the definition of ``counsel''
and to the general provision incorporating definitions set forth in the Article 1904 and ECC Rules. Definitions have
been added for ``Free Trade Area Country,'' ``Mexican Secretary,'' and ``Relevant FTA Secretary,'' reflecting
the provisions of the NAFTA and the implementing legislation. Specific cross-references to 1904 Panel and ECC Rules
have been deleted from the definition of ``Notice of Appearance'' to avoid confusion that may result from subsequent
renumbering of the 1904 Panel and ECC Rules. Finally, the definition of the term ``Persons'' has been changed to ``Person''
for reasons of clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 207.93 covers the protection of proprietary information during panel and committee proceedings. Subsections
(b)(4), (b)(6), (c)(2)(ii)(E), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(v) have been amended to include references to the Mexican Government,
government officials or Secretary where appropriate. Subsection (c)(4)(B) has been amended to reference the ECC
Rules as well as the Article 1904 Rules. Specific cross-references have been deleted, however, to avoid confusion
that might result from subsequent renumbering of these rules. Subsections (c)(4), (c)(5), (f)(1) and (f)(2) have
been amended to change the number of copies of documents filed with the Commission Secretary from six (or seven in the
case of subsection (c)(5)(ii)(B)) to three. Subsection (d) has been corrected to indicate that only panel members
in reviews conducted under the CFTA should send a countersigned copy of their administrative protective orders to
the United States Secretary to notify the Secretary that he or she may transmit documents containing proprietary
information. Annex 1901.2(7)(a) of the NAFTA requires that panelists sign an application for a protective order,
but unlike Annex 1901.2(7)(a) of the CFTA, does not require panelists to sign a copy of the protective order itself.
Subsection (d)(2)(ii) has been amended to make explicit that the Secretary may deny an application for a protective
order by informing the applicant of the reasons for such denial within fourteen days of the Secretary's receipt of
an application therefor. Subsection (f)(5) has also been revised to indicate that the Commission Secretary is required
to provide the United States Secretary with a copy of any amendment, modification, or revocation of a protective order
issued during panel proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 207.94 addresses the protection of privileged information during Panel and Committee proceedings. The
text has been corrected to specifically reference Committees as well as Panels. The term ``Secretary'' has been modified
to ``Commission Secretary'' for clarity purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 207.100 covers sanctions for prohibited acts under these regulations. The Tariff Act, as amended by section
403(c) of the CFTA Implementation Act, authorized the Commission to impose sanctions against any person who is found
by the Commission to have violated, or induced violation of, the terms of a protective order issued by the Commission
for CFTA purposes. 19 U.S.C. 1677f(f)(4). Section 412(b)(8) of the NAFTA Implementation Act amends this provision
to exclude from its coverage judges sitting on courts created under article III of the United States Constitution
who are appointed to NAFTA binational panels or committees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules contained in &sect;&sect;207.100&hyph;207.120 address the Commission's procedures for imposing sanctions
under the statutory provision added by the CFTA Implementation Act. The same procedures will apply with respect to
the imposition of sanctions for violations of the terms of protective orders issued by the Commission for NAFTA purposes.
Subsection 207.100(a) has been amended, however, to reflect the statutory exclusion of federal judges from the persons
who may be subject to sanctions under the Commission's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection 207.102(b) addresses Commission determinations on recommendations made by the Office of Unfair Import
Investigations on the initiation of sanction proceedings. A reference to ``OUII'' in this subsection has been changed
to the ``Office of Unfair Import Investigations'' because ``OUII'' is not a defined term in these rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection 207.102(d) currently addresses, among other matters, the situations in which it may be appropriate to
request the authorized agency of Canada to initiate proceedings under Canadian law on the basis of an alleged violation
of the protective order. By changing the references to ``Canada'' to ``another Free Trade Agreement country,'' this
provision now will provide for the referral of an investigation to Mexico or to Canada, as may be appropriate in the
circumstances. Section 207.120, which provides for public notice of sanctions has been amended to provide for notice
to appropriate Mexican, as well as United States and Canadian, agencies.

for other reasons an authorized agency of another Free Trade Area country would be the more appropriate forum for initiation
of a proceeding, the Commission shall take the necessary steps for issuance of a letter requesting the authorized

act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Commission may make any determination regarding notification about the alleged prohibited act and the relevant
underlying facts to the persons who submitted the proprietary information that allegedly has been disclosed. A determination

 Suspension. Each milliliter contains 25 milligrams (mg) of neomycin sulfate, 10,000 international units (IU's)
of penicillin G procaine, 5,000 IU's of polymyxin B sulfate, 2 mg of hydrocortisone acetate, and 1.25 mg of hydrocortisone
sodium succinate for the topical treatment of dogs for summer eczema, atopic dermatitis, interdigital eczema, and
otitis externa caused by bacteria susceptible to neomycin, penicillin, and polymyxin B. The product was originally
approved on September 15, 1959. Accordingly, the regulations in 21 CFR 524.1484h are amended to reflect approval
of the NADA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

this application is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(i) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, 31&blank;CFR part
550 (the ``LSR''), to revoke &sect;550.516, which unblocked, by general license, deposits in currencies other than
U.S. dollars held by U.S. persons abroad, if otherwise blocked under the LSR. FAC's amendment is consistent with action
by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 883 of November 11, 1993. The Security Council determined in
that resolution that the continued failure of the Government of Libya (``GOL'') to demonstrate by concrete actions
its renunciation of terrorism, and in particular the GOL's continued failure to respond fully and effectively to
the requests and decisions of the Security Council in Resolutions 731 and 748, concerning the bombing of the Pan Am
103 and UTA 772 flights, constituted a threat to international peace and security. Accordingly, Resolution 883 called
upon member states, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to freeze certain GOL financial assets in their territories, and to ensure that their nationals did not make such
funds or any other funds or financial resources available to the GOL or any entity owned or controlled by the GOL. In
light of this resolution, FAC is revoking &sect;550.516 to eliminate an exception that had existed to the comprehensive
blocking of GOL property required by Executive Order 12544 of January 8, 1986 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 183) and by the LSR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the LSR involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning presumptive service
connection for certain diseases even though there is no record of the disease during service. This amendment is necessary
to implement a decision of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under the authority granted by the Agent Orange Act of
1991 that there is an association between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam
era and the subsequent development of Hodgkin's disease and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). The intended effect of
this amendment is to establish presumptive service connection for those conditions based on herbicide exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 3.307(a), 3.309(e), and 3.311a to establish presumptive service connection
for Hodgkin's disease and PCT based on exposure to herbicides in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50528&hyph;30). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments, suggestions
or objections concerning the proposal on or before October 28, 1993. Since no comments were received, the proposed
amendments are adopted without change.

The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.

 (i) For the purposes of this section, the term ``herbicide agent'' means a chemical in an herbicide used in support
of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era, specifically:
2,4&hyph;D; 2,4,5&hyph;T and its contaminant TCDD; cacodylic acid; and picloram.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The diseases listed at &sect;3.309(e) shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after
service, except that chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne and porphyria cutanea tarda
shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year after the last date on which the veteran was
exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam
era and has a disease listed at &sect;3.309(e) shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide
agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during
that service. The last date on which such a veteran shall be presumed to have been exposed to an herbicide agent shall
be the last date on which he or she served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era. ``Service in the Republic
of Vietnam'' includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved
duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.

 This action amends 40 CFR part 60, subpart O, Standards of Performance for Sewage Treatment Plants. Specifically,
provisions requiring metals analysis of air samples and sludge samples are deleted. This deletion is occasioned
by the promulgation of final regulations under section 405(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) on February 19, 1993, which
eliminates the reason for metals testing under this subpart.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart O of 40 CFR part 60 establishes New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), pursuant to section 111 of the Clean
Air Act (Act) for new, modified or reconstructed sewage sludge incinerators. The NSPS limits emissions of particulate
matter (PM) discharged to the atmosphere to 0.65 g/kg dry sludge input (1.30 lb/ton dry sludge input) and the opacity
of any gases discharged to 20 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the NSPS presents test methods and procedures for compliance demonstration. Among these is paragraph
60.154(d) (3)&hyph;(5) which calls for the analysis of air emissions samples collected by EPA method 5 and composite
samples of sludge for ten metals. This requirement was added to the October 6, 1988 regulation because, ``*&blank;*&blank;*
EPA's intention (is) to consolidate existing waste management authorities with the broad authorities provided
under section 405 of the CWA. Section 405(d) of the CWA requires EPA to develop regulations for the use and disposal
of sewage sludge. The measurement of metals will assist the Agency in establishing guidelines for State and local
sludge management programs. Also, this will assist the Agency in determining if future regulatory action is warranted.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Need for the Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As EPA has promulgated the final sewage sludge regulations pursuant to section 405(d) of the CWA (published February
19, 1993 (58 FR 9248)), with requirements for testing and control of metals from sewage sludge incinerators that supersede
the provisions of &sect;60.154(d)(3) through (5), there is no longer a need to collect data on metals emissions and
the metals content of sludge for the development of the CWA regulations pursuant to &sect;60.154(d)(3) through (5).
Therefore, 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) shall be deleted from
&sect;60.154. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA hereby publishes this amendment to Subpart O to delete paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) to eliminate duplicate
and conflicting metal testing requirements for sewage sludge incinerators that are regulated under the Act and the
CWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective April 4, 1994 unless, within 30 days of publication,
notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publication of a further notice.
That notice will withdraw the final action and begin a new rulemaking by proposing the action and establishing a comment
period.

 In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54355), EPA issued a notice announcing that E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., had submitted
a food/feed additive petition (FAP 3H5659) to EPA proposing to amend 40 CFR parts 185 and 186, under section 409 of the
FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. 348, by establishing a tolerance in or on citrus oil and increasing tolerances in or on dried citrus
pulp, dried apple pomace, and raisin waste for the combined residues of hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane
and its organotin metabolites calculated as hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane. The Agency has determined
that citrus oil may be a human food, and a tolerance in or on citrus oil must be included in 40 CFR 185.3550. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tolerances exist for residues in citrus fruits, apples, and grapes (40 CFR 180.362). Studies submitted in support
of the reregistration of hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane showed that it concentrates during the
processing of these commodities. The Agency requested that Du Pont submit a food additive petition that proposed
tolerances that would be adequate for the increased concentrations of residues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The pesticide is considered useful
for the purpose for which the tolerances are sought and capable of achieving its intended physical or technical effect.
The toxicological data considered in support of the proposed tolerances include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A subchronic rat feeding study (data requirements satisfied by the chronic rat study) with a no-observed-effect
level (NOEL) of 50 parts per million (ppm) and a lowest-effect level (LEL) of 100 ppm, based on increased BUN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A 21-day rabbit dermal toxicity study with systemic NOEL greater than 5 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg) of body weight/day
and dermal NOEL of 0.05 mg/kg of body weight/day, based on erythema and edema.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A chronic rat feeding/carcinogenicity study with NOEL of 100 ppm (equivalent to 5 mg/kg of body weight/day) and
LEL of 600 ppm (equivalent to 30 mg/kg of body weight/day), based on increased alkaline phosphatase and testes weight.
Under the study conditions carcinogenic potential was not demonstrated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A chronic dog feeding study with NOEL of 5 mg/kg of body weight/day and LEL of 15 mg/kg of body weight/day, based on
vomiting and diarrhea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A mouse carcinogenicity study with NOEL of 100 ppm (equivalent to 15 mg/kg of body weight/day) and LEL of 300 ppm (equivalent
to 45 mg/kg of body weight/day) based on decreased body weights. Under the study conditions carcinogenic potential
was not demonstrated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A rat developmental toxicity study with maternal NOEL of 15 mg/kg of body weight/day and maternal LEL of 30 mg/kg
of body weight/day, based on postimplantation loss and decreased body weight. The developmental NOEL was 30 mg/kg
of body weight/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A rabbit developmental toxicity study with a maternal/developmental NOEL of 1 mg/kg of body weight/day and a maternal/developmental
LEL of 5 mg/kg of body weight/day, based on slightly decreased maternal body weight/intrauterine mortality. Maternal
death resulted at 10 mg/kg of body weight/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A two-generation rat reproduction study with maternal/reproductive NOEL of 75 ppm (5.2 mg/kg of body weight/day
in males and 5.98 mg/kg of body weight/day in females) and maternal/reproductive LEL of 250 ppm (17.4 mg/kg of body
weight/day in males and 20.3 mg/kg of body weight/day in females), based on decreased maternal body weight and food
consumption and decreased pup body weight during lactation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Ames gene mutation assay was negative up to cytotoxic levels. 10. Several other mutagenicity studies that were
all negative. These include a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutation assay, a human lymphocyte assay for chromosomal
aberration, and an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. A general metabolism study in rats shows that bioaccumulation is low, with the highest levels found in the liver,
heart, and kidneys. Most is excreted unchanged within 72 hours in the feces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference dose (RfD) based on the two-generation rat reproduction study (NOEL of 5.2 mg/kg of body weight/day
for reduced body weight and food consumption in both sexes of pups of the first and second generations) and using a 100-fold
uncertainty factor is calculated to be 0.05 mg/kg of body weight/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution
(TMRC) from existing tolerances is calculated to be 0.068104 mg/kg of body weight/day. The current action will not
increase the TMRC, and no dietary risk exposure analysis was conducted. Published tolerances for meat and milk will
cover any secondary residues that may result from use as feed items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adequate gas chromatographic analytical methods are available in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM
II), for enforcement purposes. There are currently no actions pending against continued registration of this chemical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above information considered by the Agency, the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR 185.3550 and
186.3550 would protect the public health and use of the pesticide would be safe. Therefore, the tolerances are established
as set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above. 40 CFR 178.20. The objections submitted
must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections. 40 CFR 178.25.
Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections
must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each
such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. 40 CFR 178.27. A request for a hearing will be granted
if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial
issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established,
resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the
contrary; the resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify
the action requested. 40 CFR 178.32.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II announces the deletion of the Monroe Township Landfill Superfund
site in Middlesex County, New Jersey from the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL is appendix B of 40 CFR part 300,
the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated pursuant to section
105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended.
EPA and the State of New Jersey have determined that all appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been
implemented and that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate. Moreover, EPA and the State of New
Jersey have determined that remedial actions conducted at the site to date remain protective of public health, welfare,
and the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A notice of itent to delete for this site was published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63551). The closing date for comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the notice of intent to delete was January 3, 1994. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received no comments and therefore has not prepared a Responsiveness Summary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA identifies sites which appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment
and it maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of Hazardous Substance Response
Trust Fund (Fund)&hyph;financed remedial actions. Section 300.425(e)(3) of the NCP states that Fund-financed
actions may be taken at sites deleted from the NPL in the unlikely event that conditions at the site warrant such action.
Deletion of a site from the NPL does not affect responsible party liability or impede agency efforts to recover costs
associated with response efforts.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is eliminating the Uniform System of Accounts for common and contract motor carriers of property.
In addition, the Commission is revising the report form designations for class I and class II motor carriers of property
and is changing the classification threshold levels for classes I, II, and III motor carriers. The intent of these
changes is to reduce regulatory and accounting burdens for these carriers and to create a simplified report form for
those carriers earning between $3 and $10 million in annual operating revenues. Use of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP), in lieu of the Uniform System of Accounts, and simplified annual reports for class II carriers
permit the Commission to carry out fully its regulatory oversight functions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 28, 1992 at 57 FR 33314. Based on comments received in response to that notice, the Commission is revising the
Code of Federal Regulations by eliminating 49 CFR part 1207 and modifying 49 CFR part 1249. Also, annual reports for
motor carriers of property are being modified, with two annual report forms being designated; Form M&hyph;1 (essentially
identical to the old Form M) for class I carriers, and a simplified Form M&hyph;2 for class II carriers. Additional
information is contained in the Commission's decision. To receive a copy of the full decision, write to, call, or pick
up in person from: Dynamic Concepts, Inc., room 2229, Interstate Commerce Commission Building, Washington, DC 20423.

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we conclude that our action in this proceeding will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. No new regulatory requirements are imposed, directly or indirectly, on
such entities. The purpose of our regulation is to reduce regulatory burden for the motor carriers. The economic impact
on small entities, if any, will be to reduce the cost of maintaining and preparing reports to the Commission, and is
not likely to be significant within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Class I.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues (including interstate and intrastate) of $10 million or more
after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Class I.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues (including interstate and intrastate) of at least $3 million
but less than $10 million after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class III. Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues (including interstate and intrastate) of less than
$3 million after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by annual carrier operating revenues (excluding
revenues from private carriage, compensated intercorporate hauling, and leasing vehicles with drivers to private
carriers) after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A. Upward and downward classification will be effected
as of January 1 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of revenue qualification.

(4) Carriers shall notify the Commission of any change in classification and any change in annual operating revenues
that causes them to exceed the class I limit by writing to the Office of Economics, Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington, DC 20423. In unusual or extraordinary extenuating circumstances, where the classification process
will unduly burden the carrier, such as partial liquidation, or curtailment or elimination of contracted services,
the carrier may request from the Commission a waiver or an exception from these regulations. This request shall be
in writing, specifying the conditions justifying the waiver or exception. The Commission shall notify the carriers
of any change in classification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Carriers not required to file an Annual Report (Form M&hyph;1 or Form M&hyph;2) may be required to file the Annual
Carrier Classification Survey Form. All carriers will be notified of any classification changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 annually an index number which shall be used to adjust gross annual operating revenues. This index number (deflator)
shall be based on the Producers Price Index of Finished Goods. Its intended use is to eliminate the effects of inflation
from the classification process. See Note A that follows:

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS, upon application from the U.S. Department of the Navy (Navy), issues regulations to govern the unintentional
take of a small number of marine mammals incidental to a wide variety of proposed Navy projects involving the underwater
detonation of conventional explosives in the offshore waters of the Outer Sea Test Range (OSTR) of the Naval Air Warfare
Center (NAWC), Pt. Mugu, Ventura County, CA, over the next 5 years. Issuance of regulations governing unintentional
incidental takes in connection with particular activities is required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA)
when the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), after notice and opportunity for comment, finds as here, that such takes
will have a negligible impact on the species and stocks and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability
of them for subsistence uses. These regulations do not authorize the Navy's proposed activities, such authorization
is provided by the National Defense Authorization Act and is not within the jurisdiction of the Secretary. Rather,
these regulations authorize the unintentional incidental take of marine mammals in connection with such activities
and prescribe methods of taking and other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the species and
its habitat, and on the availability of the species for subsistence uses.

.) directs the Secretary to allow, upon request by U.S. citizens engaged in a specific activity (other than commercial
fishing) in a specified geographical region, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine
mammals, if certain findings are made and regulations are issued. Under the MMPA, the term ``taking'' means to harass,
hunt, capture or kill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permission may be granted for periods up to 5 years if the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for public
comment, that the taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s) of marine mammals and will not have
an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock(s) for subsistence uses. In addition, the
Secretary must prescribe regulations that include permissible methods of taking and other means effecting the least
practicable adverse impact on the species and its habitat, and on the availability of the species for subsistence
uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds and areas of similar significance. The regulations
must include requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking.

In 1986, the MMPA and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543) were amended to allow incidental takings of depleted, endangered, or threatened marine
mammals. Before the 1986 amendments, section 101(a)(5) applied only to non-depleted marine mammals, and the more
restrictive provisions of the MMPA prevailed, which meant that an incidental take of endangered or depleted marine
mammals could not be allowed even if the anticipated take would result in only negligible impacts.

Summary of Request

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 13, 1993, NMFS received an application from the Navy for a Letter of Authorization (LOA) under section 101(a)(5)
of the MMPA and 50 CFR 228.6, that would allow the unintentional take of small numbers of pinnipeds and cetaceans for
a period of 5 years, commencing February 1994, incidental to a wide variety of military projects involving the underwater
detonation of conventional explosives in the offshore waters of the OSTR of the NAWC, off Pt. Mugu, Ventura County,
CA, seaward of the Channel Islands. This application was made available for public review on June 7, 1993 (58 FR 31944).
NMFS requested comments, information and suggestions concerning the request and the structure and content of the
regulations governing the take. The comment period closed on July 7, 1993. The application was subsequently modified
by letter on September 2, 1993 to request an incidental take for two additional species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the Navy describes its proposed activities under the ``Live Fire'' testing program mandated by the National Defense
Authorization Act (10 U.S.C. 139), ships and critical components or systems constructed for the Navy must undergo
shock tests prior to service with the fleet to determine the integrity of the structure and electronic systems that
are vital to the overall function and performance of the vessel and its crew under wartime combat conditions. This
is especially true when a new class of ship is constructed. The new ship must be subjected to a ``near-miss'' underwater
explosion while its crew tracks airborne and waterborne targets in the area. These tests help the Navy identify weaknesses
in the ship's design early in the construction of a new class of ship, which, when corrected, enhance the survivability
of the ship, its systems, and most importantly, its crew. The design corrections and improvements are then applied
to all follow-on ships of that class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shock trial is a complicated combat simulation that requires the participation of several Navy aircraft and ships.
Their purpose is to challenge the shock trial ship's tracking and communications systems after the detonation. To
ensure the safety of commercial aircraft and vessels, the Navy must conduct these trials in an area where they can maintain
control of air and sea space while the trial is being conducted. In addition, the site must be close to the repair facilities,
should the ship become disabled. Under normal conditions, for Navy ships homeported on the west coast, the designated
site is the OSTR, which is under the jurisdiction of the NAWC. The Navy anticipates that on an annual basis, no more than
10 projects involving underwater explosions will be conducted under the requested LOA (Table 1).

The Navy has requested a take of four species of pinnipeds and 17 species (or species groups) of cetaceans by harassment,
injury and death (Table 2). The proposed activities would occur in the Southern California Bight (SCB), an area with
a potentially high density of marine mammals. Potential impacts to marine mammals include both lethal and non-lethal
injuries, as well as physical and acoustic harassment. Injury or death may occur as a direct result of the explosive
blast (concussion) itself. Injury may include damage to internal organs, as well as to the auditory system. Harassment
of marine mammals may occur as a result of non-injurious physiological responses to both the explosion-generated
shockwave, as well as to the acoustic signature of the detonation.

The Navy describes in its application efforts that will be made to minimize project related impacts to marine mammals
(see below_Measures to Reduce Impacts). The Navy strongly believes that impacts can be held to an acceptably low level
by mandating conservative safety zones for marine mammal exclusion and by incorporating an active aerial survey
monitoring effort in the program both prior to, and after, detonation of explosives. The Navy states that tests will
not be conducted if marine mammals, sea turtles, fish schools, or seabirds are detected within the safety zone, or
if weather and sea conditions preclude adequate aerial surveillance. Also, if post-test surveys determine that
an injurious or lethal take of a marine mammal has occurred, the test procedure and the monitoring methods will be reviewed
by the Navy and NMFS and appropriate changes will be made.

regulations (58 FR 53491) authorizing and governing the unintentional taking of a small number of pinnipeds and cetaceans
incidental to the Navy's underwater explosives detonations program in the OSTR. Public meetings were held on November

Comments and Responses

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the 45-day comment period, NMFS received several hundred letters and photocopied form letters from the general
public, all but 4 of which were in opposition either to the detonation of explosives in the SCB or to the proposed regulations.
Most of these comments did not address the contents of the Navy's application, the proposed regulations, or the EA.
Instead, the commenters stated their opposition to the Navy's proposed activities because there would be a loss of
marine life; because they believed aerial surveys were inadequate; and because they believed there would be an adverse
impact on pregnant gray whales. In addition, NMFS received approximately 75 letters or hearing statements within
the comment period that substantially discussed the issues and science upon which the proposed regulations were
based.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Navy conducts ship shock tests under the authority of the National Defense Authorization Act. The Navy does not
require NMFS authorization to conduct these tests. However, under the MMPA, the taking of marine mammals is prohibited
unless authorized by exemption or permit. Since there is a possibility that marine mammals may be unintentionally
taken incidental to the ship shock trials, the Navy applied to NMFS for a small take authorization under section 101(a)(5)
of the MMPA. Thus, it is the taking of marine mammals incidental to the Navy's ship shock tests that NMFS is authorizing.

One commenter believed that section 101(a) of the MMPA, under which the Navy is seeking permission for an unintentional
take, is not appropriate for the Navy's purposes, as it was written to allow for indigenous groups to fish for subsistence.
Others believe the MMPA is to protect marine mammals and that no takings under a LOA should be authorized.

NMFS does not agree. Section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA was enacted in 1981 specifically to provide a means to authorize
incidental takes in connection with legitimate maritime activities other than commercial or subsistence fishing.
Prior to 1981, these incidental takes were prohibited by the MMPA moratorium on taking and any such takings were subject
to prosecution under the MMPA.

Commenters stated that NMFS cannot make a finding of negligible impact unless the impact is small, and of little consequence.
Also, if the potential effects would be significant, NMFS cannot make a finding of negligible impact.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under NMFS' regulatory definition (50 CFR 228.4), a negligible impact is an impact resulting from the specified activity
that cannot reasonably be expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affect the species or stock of marine
mammal through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival. The 1986 amendments to the MMPA altered the previous
standard for determining negligible impact. Prior to the 1986 amendments, the taking from the impact had to be ``so
small, unimportant, or of so little consequence as to warrant little or no attention.'' However, after the 1986 amendment,
NMFS adopted the definition of negligible impact set out in the Senate's Section-by-Section Analysis (132 Cong.
Rec. S16305, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 15, 1986). Section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA clearly indicates that some level of adverse effects involving the
take of depleted marine mammals can be authorized so long as the impact is negligible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that the taking of 1,917 marine mammals annually does not represent a ``small number.''
Another commenter considered the requested take to not have a ``negligible impact.'' This commenter and several
others also state that an incidental take exceeding 9,600 marine mammals over the 5-year period is not small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the EA, because not all species of marine mammals would be expected to be found within the vicinity of a test
site during any particular test, the take estimates should not be considered additive for the purposes of determining
whether the incidental take is small. The MMPA requires NMFS to authorize incidental takes on a species/stock basis
based upon the best scientific information available. Therefore, even though it is extremely unlikely that more
than a few species/stocks would be present at any one time in the offshore waters of the SCB, authorizations must be
made on a species basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, because NMFS and the Navy cannot know in advance which of these species would be within the SCB at the time
of a test, the Navy found it necessary to design its request as though all species/stocks recorded as inhabiting the
offshore waters of the SCB would be within the safety zone, even though the probability of that happening is considered
extremely remote. For that reason, as noted in the EA, NMFS considers the taking request (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1,917 marine mammals) to reflect a ``worst-case scenario.'' This is also true for the total taking over 5 years; the
statutory requirement is for a determination that the total taking (over the 5-year authorization period) would
have a negligible impact (see previous response).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA requires [regulations regarding] the protection of rookeries.
This commenter also believes NMFS failed to consider impacts upon other marine species. For example, the commenter
stated that the EA does not mention impacts upon the migratory routes of gray whales and other migratory species and
that it fails to ``pay particular attention'' to these significant species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS does not agree. The EA notes that the underwater explosives detonations will have no impacts on marine mammals
that are ashore at the time of detonation; therefore, without information to the contrary, regulations are unnecessary
to protect onshore rookeries. In addition, the best available scientific information indicates that the requested
taking will have no more than a negligible impact on the populations of marine mammals inhabiting the waters of the
SCB, their mating grounds, migratory routes and other areas of similar significance. The EA discusses fully the impacts
on those marine species believed to frequent the test area, including gray whales, other marine mammals and other
species. The EA indicated that no gray whales were sighted within Area 2 and NMFS therefore concluded that no gray whales
will be killed and that only three would incur non-lethal injuries. For the same reasons the migratory routes of gray
whales will be unaffected by the short-term impacts from the detonation itself. Moreover, gray whales are resilient
to human activities and will reoccupy areas once the activity ceases (see 58 FR 3121, January 7, 1993), further limiting
expected impacts.

One commenter stated that the MMPA requires NMFS to prescribe regulations that restrict, among other things, ``the
season or the period of time within which animals may be taken'' and the ``manner and locations in which animals may
be taken.''

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the provisions of section 103 of the MMPA do not apply for small takes under section 101(a)(5), seasonal restrictions
are viewed by NMFS as one method of reducing takes. However, there is no scientific evidence at this time to indicate
that there is any one period of the year when marine mammals are not within the OSTR. Although population assessment
research in the SCB, currently underway, will be reviewed to determine if seasonal restrictions would result in lower
incidental takes, because the marine environment of the SCB is dynamic and significantly influenced by oceanographic
factors such as El Ni&ntilde;o, this might not be practical on a long-term basis. However, the Navy will be required
to locate the areas within the OSTR that have the lowest numbers of marine mammals and to conduct its tests within those
areas.

Several commenters noted the number of species requested for taking that are either depleted under the MMPA or threatened
or endangered under the ESA (and should not be taken).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1986, both the MMPA and the ESA were amended to allow incidental takings of depleted, endangered, or threatened
marine mammals. Before the 1986 amendments, section 101(a)(5) applied only to non-depleted marine mammals, which
meant that an incidental take of endangered or depleted marine mammals could not be authorized even if the anticipated
take would result in only negligible impacts. However, both the MMPA and ESA now specifically provide for authorization
of such takes, so long as the requisite findings can be made. As required by the ESA, NMFS has consulted with the Navy
under section 7 (refer to response under ``Endangered Species Act Concerns'' below for additional information on
section 7 consultation). A copy of the Biological Opinion resulting from that consultation is available upon request

One commenter opposed the project because, among other things, estimated takes presented by the Navy are calculated
from models that may be based on invalid assumptions. The commenter continues that even though NMFS believes the takes
will have a proportionally minor impact on the large local populations of marine mammals, hundreds, if not thousands,
of animals will be harassed by the detonations, while a sizable number will potentially be injured and killed.

The two assumptions that may not be valid were discussed fully in the application and the EA. These are (1) that species
are distributed uniformly in space and time, and (2) that pinniped species are in the water all year. The first assumption
is discussed in the following response and under ``Population Assessment Methodology,'' below. The latter assumption
is misleading because many of these animals will be on the beach for 1&hyph;3 months during breeding and/or molting
cycles; use of this assumption (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that all pinnipeds are in the water all the time) leads to a higher incidental take estimate, not a lower one. The negligible
impact determination under section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA was discussed above.

Two commenters were concerned that the distribution of marine mammals was difficult to predict because marine mammals
exhibit associative, or clumped distributions. This, one of the commenters believes, could cause the incidental
take number to be lower or higher than requested.

Response:

NMFS agrees. Those marine mammal species that tend towards group association could be subjected to a higher incidental
take on a single detonation, provided their behavior also includes all individuals in the school diving at the same
time, thereby making the entire pod or school invisible to observers. It is also just as likely that, because of grouping
or clumping behavior, during the 4-week period for a ship shock trial, random distribution of the school(s) would
mean that this species would not be within the safety zone at the time of testing, and therefore not subject to take.
However, should the annual taking authorization for any species be reached, then any future takings would be considered
to be in violation of the LOA, the implementing regulations and the MMPA.

On a related issue, one commenter questioned whether it was a ``conservative approach'' to estimate mysticete (baleen
whales) abundance (from which incidental take estimates are calculated), by using ``California-wide estimates
and `scaling' them to the focal area.'' This commenter also questioned the incidental take calculations for California
sea lions, since the females and young apparently remain in the area year-round.

NMFS believes the calculations for mysticete abundance is a conservative approach. As noted in the EA, during aerial
surveys in the winter/spring period, blue whales were the only mysticete species observed within Area 2 (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the OSTR). Based upon this observation, an incidental take authorization for mysticetes should include only blue
whales. However, because of the migratory nature of mysticetes, a conservative approach was taken, which was to request
additional mysticete species based upon the method mentioned by the commenter.

While California sea lions are the most abundant pinniped species in the SCB, because they are more likely to remain
closer to islands and the coastline, fewer are expected to be in the area of the test. Therefore, fewer animals are anticipated
to be incidentally taken.

One commenter was concerned that takes by physical harassment is not defined, that harassment parameters are based
upon tests on humans in an air environment, and the relationship between avoidance behavior caused by aircraft and
that of the detonation. This commenter (and others) was also concerned that marine mammals would not be detectable
from the air, making the incidental take tables suspect.

 in order to determine the parameters for physical harassment. Physical harassment of cetaceans due to tactile ``stings''
from the shockwave accompanying detonations has been inferred from studies with humans. This inference seems plausible
given studies on dolphin skin sensitivity where the authors

 concluded that ``the most sensitive areas of the dolphin skin (mouth, eyes, snout, melon and blowhole) are about as
sensitive as the skin of human lips and fingers.'' Skin sensitivity on pinnipeds and large whales has not been tested.
Therefore, until tests can be conducted to determine the overall sensitivity of the skin of marine mammals, NMFS and
the Navy have made the assumption that both humans and marine mammals have similar tactile sensitivity in the water.

In another rulemaking, NMFS has proposed a new definition of ``harass'' (58 FR 53320, October 14, 1993) at 50 CFR 216.3.
Harass is proposed to mean, under the definition of ``take'' in the MMPA, ``an intentional or negligent act or omission
that results in, an injury to a marine mammal, a disruption in the behavior that a marine mammal was exhibiting prior
to the act or omission, or a significant effect on the normal behavioral patterns of a marine mammal, including, but
not limited to, breeding, feeding, sheltering, or migration patterns.'' This definition, if implemented in that
rulemaking, will apply also to these small take regulations.

As stated in the application, for reasons of safety, aircraft cannot be airborne at the time of detonation and will
need to leave the area approximately 3 minutes prior to detonation. Therefore, ``avoidance behavior'' by marine
mammals, unfortunately, will not be directly observable from the air. Harassment takes will be calculated indirectly
as those animals detected within the 3-nm post-test search zone, but outside the area wherein the test is considered
to have resulted in death or injury.

NMFS and the Navy recognize that some marine mammal species will be difficult to detect from the air and that some injurious
and/or lethal takes may occur even with the mitigative measures being implemented to reduce takes. The ability of
aerial observers to detect these species has been taken into account when calculating incidental take levels (refer
to Table 14 and accompanying text in the EA; also see ``Mitigation'' responses below).

Marine mammal scientists will categorize marine mammals detected within a search area of approximately 3-nm radius
of a 10,000-lb charge detonation according to whether they are: (1) deceased, or severely injured and likely to die;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ``injured'' but not likely to die; and (3) harassed. If the marine mammal is believed to have been within approximately
1 nm of the test site at the time of detonation, it will be listed as either dead or seriously injured; ``injured, but
not seriously, if outside 1 nm but within approximately 13/4 nm, and ``harassed'' if outside 13/4 nm but within the
3-nm search area. NMFS notes that counting all marine mammals observed within 3 nm of a test site should account for
all incidental takes, since outside the monitoring area, the 160 dB level for the onset of harassment takes will be
found only at a significant depth. The LOA will specify the conditions for categorizing marine mammals, and, among
other things, the size of the safety zone for each detonation weight. The final rule has been written to clarify terms.

One commenter noted that provision is made in the proposed regulations for altering the test procedure if marine mammal
fatalities or injuries are detected. The commenter feels that if the consensus among marine biologists is that harassment
occurs beyond the bounds of the safety zone *&blank;*&blank;*, this should also be justification for altering the
test procedure.

Theoretically, physical and acoustic harassment may occur outside the 2-nm safety zone (refer to the Navy application
for information). However, because of shot geometries, the amount of ``safe water'' at the water surface is closer
to the detonation point than the perimeter of the safety zone. For this reason, NMFS believes that the 3-nm post-test
survey zone will include all marine mammals ``harassed'' by the shot. NMFS will continue to monitor ship shock tests
to determine whether modifications to the procedure, the regulations or the monitoring program will result in a decrease
in marine mammal take, including takes by harassment.

One commenter noted that the application presents test data versus model predictions for lung injury (Table 7) and
because marine mammals vary greatly in size and volume of air spaces, fat content, and other things, fixed models are
problematic in describing lethal or injurious effects to marine mammals.

Absent data from experimental testing on live marine mammals (or other proxy animals) for the larger explosive charges,
the model predictions are the best scientific data available and have been used by NMFS and the Navy for their calculations
of incidental take. However, it should be noted that figures 11 through 15 in the application show the calculated range
for the onset of slight lung injury as a function of both the marine mammal weight and the explosive charge weight. Figure
11 shows that the larger the mammal, the closer to the detonation site the animal needed to be in order to incur injury.
The Navy used a marine mammal weighing 110 lb (50 kilograms (kg)) to calculate the safety range necessary to preclude
injury to marine mammals.

The low frequency (below 300 Hz) of the detonation acoustic signal has been determined as being too low to harass any
odontocetes (i.e., toothed whales). The commenter stated that only limited data are available on the effect of low
frequency sound on odontocetes, and because the data available are for one or two species (to the commenter's knowledge),
can NMFS therefore make such a sweeping assumption?

The best scientific information available indicates that odontocete cetaceans cannot hear well in the frequencies
emitted by the explosive detonation. Additional evidence indicates that they also may not be able to hear the pulse
generated from underwater detonations of even the largest charges because it is very brief (ca. 0.05 sec). However,
because odontocetes and pinnipeds are considered to be ``taken'' by physical harassment already, whether they also
hear (and are thereby acoustically harassed) the explosion would not add significantly to the take estimates.

The number of Navy vessels and aircraft that would be involved in the exercise will depend upon their specific requirements
for the ship shock trial. The effect of these vessels on marine life, including marine mammals, would be expected to
be negligible and likely no more intrusive than that caused by commercial and other vessels using the nearby Route
2 ship traffic lane into Los Angeles/Long Beach (approximately 4.6 percent of the approximately 19,800 round trips
annually by non-commercial fishing marine vessels into Los Angeles/Long Beach use Route 2).

There may be some inadvertent harassment of marine mammals by marine mammal surveillance aircraft during the various
surveys for mammal-free areas for the detonation site. However, because these search efforts are under the direction
and control of NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) and are for the purpose of avoiding injury or death
to marine mammals, this activity is being covered under their scientific research permit (Permit Number 873; P77

50). In addition, there might be some harassment takes during the post-survey monitoring and recovery efforts. This
latter program is authorized by the regulations (50 CFR 228.55(d)(2)) and does not require a separate permit under

One commenter wanted the Navy to recalculate its incidental take request by using the upper 95th percentile of the
population abundance estimates instead of the mean of those estimates. This, the commenter believes, would avoid
the possibility of the Navy exceeding its authorized take limits and needing to cease operations in order to request
the additional takes.

Such an amendment to the Navy's application would inordinately delay the scheduled ship shock trial. In addition,
because of the very conservative approach to estimating the number of incidental takes, it is considered extremely
unlikely that explosives detonations in the OSTR will result in incidental take levels approaching the requested
level.

NMFS uses both the MMPA and the ESA standard of ``the best available scientific and commercial data'' to determine
the impacts of activities on marine mammals. Although NMFS would like to have more baseline data on marine mammals
within the SCB and more information on the effects of large-charge detonations on marine life, in particular on marine
mammals, NMFS based its decision on the best information available, including NMFS marine mammal assessment surveys
conducted in 1991 and 1992 and Defense Department research on the effects of explosions on marine life. NMFS is not
aware of any more recent scientific evidence that would be contrary to its findings and two commenters did not provide
citations or references to any new information. Also, without knowledge of scientific evidence contrary to research
used in its determination, NMFS is confident that it used the best scientific and commercial data available in making
its determination. However, monitoring is a requirement of the regulations and for a continuation of the LOA. The
results from the monitoring will be used to verify (or refute) the findings made by NMFS, and if new evidence or data
indicate that the impact on marine mammals is more than negligible, NMFS will reassess its findings and take appropriate
action as mandated by section 101(a)(5)(B)(ii) of the MMPA.

The EA, upon which the proposed regulations rely, fails to meet the standards mandated by the MMPA because NMFS failed
not only in obtaining the best scientific evidence available, but failed in using even the limited evidence available
as a basis for a reasoned conclusion. For instance, the Navy has indicated to NMFS that tests will not be conducted if
marine mammals are detected within the testing zone *&blank;*&blank;* and NMFS concluded *&blank;*&blank;* that
such efforts will minimize impacts to marine mammals, despite knowing that many marine mammals will not be visible
by aerial survey. The commenter continues that the Navy, given its years of experience under the seas, should be able
to detect marine mammals.

NMFS used the best scientific information available in making its assessments and determinations (see previous
response). As stated in the EA, the evidence indicates that some marine mammal species may not be observed by aerial
surveillance during pre-test overflights (because they are submerged at the time). Since detonation of the explosive
charge will not take place if even a single marine mammal (or sea turtle, fish school or seabird flock) is observed within
the safety zone, it is the possibility that some marine mammals would be missed during pre-test surveys which makes
a small take authorization necessary. The scientific basis for assessing the likelihood of marine mammals being
taken was fully discussed and documented in both the EA and the Navy application.

NMFS shares the concern of the commenter, but obviously, conducting tests on the effects of explosives on live marine
mammals would be controversial and an authorization may be difficult for a scientific research applicant to obtain
under the MMPA. For that reason, the Navy bases its impact assessments on theoretical calculations, supported by
test data using small charges on alternative test animals. NMFS will closely monitor ship shock tests and review the
reports required under these regulations and the LOA to determine whether the basis for the finding of negligible
impact continues to exist. If a negligible finding can no longer be made, NMFS is required under sections 101(a)(5)
(B) and (C) of the MMPA to withdraw or suspend the authorization to take marine mammals.

Several commenters criticized the survey effort claiming that some experts consider 800 ft (266 m) to be too high for
aerial surveys to observe marine mammals and that vessel surveys are potentially an unnecessary use of funds. One
commenter wants to see the survey effort placed in context with the surrounding area.

The aerial and vessel surveys were conducted by NMFS as part of its marine mammal assessment program under section
114 of the MMPA. Since these surveys were for the entire California coast and not restricted to the SCB, they were ``in
context.'' The data from these surveys were used by the Navy in its application. The survey design methodology uses
an aircraft height of 700 to 800 ft (233 to 266 m) which is the height commonly used for marine mammal surveys.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Without evidence to the contrary, NMFS continues to believe that a height of 700 to 800 ft (233 to 266 m) is appropriate,
as lower altitudes may result in missed animals due to the reduced time for observation from being closer to the water
(higher ground speed). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveys to determine areas of low marine mammal abundance and pre- and post-detonation surveys do not need to extend

One commenter considered NMFS' determination of impacts upon affected species to be ``arbitrary and capricious''
because NMFS ``admitted'' that the density of many species is unknown. Another believed the impact of the action is
unknown because the density of the species in the area is unknown. The first commenter also stated that density studies
are necessary before NMFS may proceed.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is unclear how these commenters arrived at this conclusion, as Table 14 in the EA gives the calculated density for
each species in the SCB. Population estimates for the SCB were made from aerial and vessel surveys of the California
coast in 1991 and 1992. Additional surveys were conducted in 1993 in the SCB and are currently being analyzed. However,
marine mammal density is not static, it can vary due to school size, environmental conditions, migratory patterns
and food source distribution, making it difficult to predict where in space or time an individual or a group of animals
will occur. For those reasons, when calculating the number of animals expected in the test range, an assumption is
made that distribution is uniform, which it is not. This has been discussed previously in a related comment under ``Incidental
Take'' above. (Also, refer to similar comment under ``National Environmental Policy Act Concerns'' below). The
assumptions specific to each marine mammal group is given in the EA.

Aerial and ship marine mammal surveys, upon which incidental take estimates are based, were conducted in 1991 and
1992. Additional survey work to determine areas of low marine mammal abundance for the ship shock tests were conducted
during 1993. Distribution and abundance estimates from these studies, in general, agree with previous studies,
with some exceptions, which were noted and fully discussed in the EA.

NMFS believes the mitigation measures required by the rule are adequate to protect marine mammals and reduce incidental
take to the lowest level practicable. While aerial surveys will have difficulty detecting those marine mammal species
that spend a significant portion of the time submerged, the regulations prohibit detonations if even a single marine
mammal (or sea turtle, sea bird flock or fish school) is sighted within the safety zone by aerial survey. The small take
authorization is for the unintentional take of marine mammals not sighted by aerial survey. Refer to the EA for a detailed

Some commenters suggested additional (or alternative) methods for detecting marine mammals during surveys, especially
for deep-diving species, such as sonobuoys and hydrophone arrays. One commenter also suggested, if possible, using
sound to cause some species to surface so they can be seen or to leave or avoid the test area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Navy proposes to employ hydrophone arrays at several locations to record the impulse pressure wave resulting
from the ship shock trial, these hydrophones will not be capable of recording marine mammal vocalizations. Also,
because the shock trial is a mobile exercise, and because it would be necessary to triangulate on vocalizing marine
mammals in order to determine whether or not they are within the vicinity of the shock trial, this suggestion is not
viewed as being practicable at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The practicality of using ``scare charges'' (smaller explosive charges) or high decibel noise devices in order to
scare marine mammals from the area of testing is equivocal at best. There is insufficient evidence to give assurance
that marine mammals would leave the area and not be attracted to the site.

distances greater than 2 nm. The commenter also considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Area 1'' and ``Area 2'' to be artificial and anthropocentric. Other commenters were concerned that the effects
could extend to great distances, for example physical harassment could occur 22,000 ft (6,706 m) from the detonation
and acoustic harassment up to 121,000 ft (37,039 m) for a 10,000-lb (4,536 kg) charge. One commenter was concerned
that these distances would cause an impact very close to the nearest islands.

NMFS considers the 2-nm safety zone to be adequate to protect marine mammals from injury and death. As indicated in
the EA (Table 12) for the 10,000-lb (4,536 kg) charge, the 2-nm (i.e., 12,150-ft (3,704 m)) safety zone is greater than
the calculated limit for minimum eardrum injury (9,400 ft (2,865 m)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in Table 12, while physical harassment could occur up to 22,000 ft (4.2 nm) from the detonation, as indicated
in the application, the safety zone exceeds the maximum horizontal ranges for physical harassment for mammals at
the shallow depths; however, for mammals at depths greater than 200 ft (67 m), there is a possibility for physical harassment
beyond the safety zones, since the surface reflected relief wave arrives later at these depths for these ranges. Refer
to the application for a detailed description of sound source levels in the marine environment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For acoustic harassment, based upon the best available information, pinnipeds and odontocetes are unlikely to be
subjected to acoustic harassment due to the very low frequency and extreme brevity of the sound associated with detonations.
For mysticetes, the range for the 160 dB re 1 uPa (the level above which avoidance behavior is believed to occur) increases
from 86,000 ft (14.2 nm) at a water depth of 50 ft (15 m) to 121,520 ft (20 nm) at a depth of 1,000 ft (305 m). Therefore, while
some mysticete cetaceans may be acoustically harassed if at these depths, it is unlikely that any impacts will accrue
to the coastal zone of the SCB because of the distance from the detonation site, the shallow depths of the coastal zone
and the masking effect of ambient noise (

One commenter was concerned because there was no method indicated that would assess the extent and/or severity of
acoustic (and other) injury incurred by marine mammals in the test area. The commenter states that these types of injury
would be very difficult to assess from aerial or shipboard reconnaissance. For many of the mammals that would be affected,
acoustic injury could have a profound impact on their ability to navigate and on their ability to interact with other
animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the possibility that acoustic injury could have significant impact, the commenter believes that there
should be a more comprehensive plan for assessing the extent of acoustic injury and its impact on marine life as a result
of this project.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While generally agreeing with the comment, NMFS disagrees that a more comprehensive plan is necessary. Three types
of injuries have been identified for marine mammals from ship shock trials. These are: (1) Lung injuries; (2) gastro
intestinal injuries; and (3) eardrum (rupture) injuries. As determining the type and extent of these injuries would
require capturing and either sacrificing the animal or subjecting the animal to long-term captive observation,
and as both of these are unacceptable to NMFS unless the animal requires euthanization or immediate veterinary care,
the Navy and NMFS will utilize less intrusive methods for determining incidental takes, including, but not necessarily
limited to, photo-identifying ``injured'' marine mammals, and necropsies on stranded and other dead marine mammals
to determine the probable cause of death and its relationship if any, to the trial. However, because even minimal eardrum

Commenters were concerned that the post-test surveys would not be able to detect all marine mammals (and fish) that
are killed or seriously injured during ship shock trials, because animals might sink and not rise immediately to the
surface. One commenter suggested post-detonation surveys continue for up to 1 week after the trial to search for these
animals and to assess oceanographic current patterns to determine search effort. One commenter recommended that
monitoring should be conducted over the long-term to document whether there is a chronic effect from the ship shock
trials.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS agrees with these concerns, noting that a ship shock trial is a series of one to six (usually four) charges set off
approximately one week apart. Therefore, a project and its monitoring program are likely to continue for up to six
weeks between the first and last detonations. As explained in detail in the application (refer particularly to Figure
31), post-detonation surveys will begin approximately 30 minutes after each detonation. The survey effort will
be repeated for each scheduled test until the shock trial is completed. The 48-hour advance pre-detonation marine
mammal search survey will also serve as a final post-test follow-up survey for the previous test. A post-trial follow-up
survey will be conducted approximately 1 week after the last test of the shock trial. In addition, the Marine Animal
Recovery Team (MART) will be required to make every effort to document and examine those injured or dead marine mammals
(if any) that are moved outside the test area by currents subsequent to a detonation. Finally, NMFS will monitor the
stranding records for evidence that the ship shock trials are having more than a negligible impact on the marine mammal
species and stocks in the SCB. The monitoring requirements for marine mammals will be specified in the LOA.

Although deceased marine mammals that sink will return to the surface within a few days of the detonation, it is unlikely
that subsurface fish species would be detectable during post-test monitoring and would likely be consumed by predators
before surfacing. Sea turtles will also be difficult to detect once they sink.

As the NMFS and the Navy expect few marine mammals to be killed during ship shock trials, each lethal take will be reviewed
by NMFS scientists, MART personnel and the U.S. Navy to determine whether similar takes can be prevented in future
tests. However, until ship shock tests take place and incidental lethal takes are documented, the actions NMFS and
the Navy will take to reduce potential future lethal takes cannot be determined.

NMFS believes that this recommendation is neither practical nor warranted. The ship shock test is a complicated combat
simulation that requires the participation of several Navy aircraft and ships. Therefore, the Navy cannot be prohibited
from the test area, although it will likely have moved away from the detonation site by the time the post-test monitoring
begins. Moreover, it is not entirely clear from the comment the purpose behind the requested prohibition, since the
Navy will have an authorization for incidentally taking marine mammals during the exercise.

The preamble to the proposed rule noted that NMFS will be consulting with the Navy under section 7 of the ESA. The Navy
is required to consult under section 7, and it generally is NMFS policy that formal consultation should be initiated
at the earliest opportunity, in this case, since NMFS would be conducting formal consultation with both the Navy and
itself (because the proposed issuance of a small take authorization is a Federal action), consultation was not initiated
until after the proposed rule was issued on October 15, 1993. That consultation has been completed. A copy of NMFS'
Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement is available upon request (see

Since NMFS must analyze a request for a small take authorization to determine whether the proposed marine mammal taking
has only a negligible impact on species or stocks of marine mammals and does not have an unmitigable adverse impact
on the availability for subsistence uses, NMFS assessed many of the potential environmental impacts that are also
assessed under NEPA. Through this process, and during preparation of an EA, NMFS determined that the proposed activity
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
issuance of regulations and an LOA) will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment and made a ``finding
of no significant impact.'' If an EA results in this finding, no additional documents are required by NEPA. The detonation
of the explosives by itself does not necessarily invoke a ``significant'' impact finding. However, the Navy must
also satisfy NEPA prior to undertaking any action that might impact the human environment.

The following 8 comments relate specifically to NEPA concerns raised by one or two commenters (but may also have been
mentioned by others). One of these commenters submitted detailed comments to support its position that the proposed
action will have a ``significant'' impact under NEPA and therefore requires a DEIS. However, NMFS does not concur
with the commenter's interpretation that CEQ regulations state that certain factors (which follow and are evaluated
below) are ``critical'' for making a determination relating to the ``intensity'' of the action. CEQ regulations
(40 CFR 1508.27) require these factors ``to be considered'' in evaluating the intensity of the proposed action. As
discussed below, these factors were given consideration by NMFS.

According to the Navy, ship shock testing, while possibly having a short-term impact on the marine environment, also
has a beneficial impact in ensuring the health and safety of seamen onboard the Nation's naval vessels. In its EA, NMFS
found that the proposed activity (

Comment:

The EA fails to address the degree to which the proposed action affects the public health and welfare. The commenter
was concerned that, because a variety of potentially harmful compounds from the explosive could persist in surface
pools for 30&hyph;60 minutes after detonation, this could result in subtle and long-term effects on marine mammals
and birds (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS disagrees. First, as stated in the EA (page 47), and as provided for under CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.21), NMFS
has incorporated by reference the Navy EA written in 1990
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. While identifying that document more clearly on that page may have improved the EA, the Navy EA was cited in the references.
That document described in some detail the potential impacts on the human environment from explosives detonation.
NMFS incorporated this information by reference but did not include discussion in its EA, that part of the Navy EA that
discussed impacts on humans, because NMFS was of the opinion that the proposed small take authorization would not
have an impact on public health or safety, and was therefore not relevant. However, because NMFS' proposed action
may affect the environment that marine mammals inhabit, NMFS' EA does note that while 100 percent of the solid material
and approximately 10 percent of the gases would be contained in the water pool created by the explosion (an area 10.8
X 107 ft3 (3.06 X 106 m3) for the 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) charge), the concentrations shown are below the levels considered
harmful for fish and would not be expected to pose a threat to marine mammals after the stabilization times (53 minutes
for 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) charge). The commenter's concern however, is apparently on the impact to marine mammals and
other marine life entering the surface pool before stabilization (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
less than 53 minutes after detonation). Assuming these marine mammals were not within the 2-nm safety zone at the time
of detonation, NMFS believes that the likelihood of this occurring is remote and if it happens there will be little
or no effect, either singly or cumulatively, from the chemical components of the surface pool. As noted in the Navy
EA, the chemical components (primarily composed of gases) would be thoroughly dispersed, with no possible buildup
or cumulative effect, and become indistinguishable from other trace level constituents of the ocean shortly after
detonation. The only solid particles are carbon and aluminum oxide. Carbon particles will tend to float on the surface
and move with the pool while aluminum oxide particles, a naturally occurring component of seawater due to the weathering
of rock, will probably settle to the bottom over a large area.

While the SCB can be considered an ecologically important area that contains ``unique characteristics'' including
the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary, because the area surrounding the detonation site will be in an area of low marine
mammal abundance (and presumably other marine life); off the continental shelf (on or near the Patton Escarpment);
approximately 50 nm from the nearest boundary of the sanctuary; and, although in productive waters, not in a major
upwelling (nutrient-rich) or commercial fishing area, NMFS believes that the small take authorization will not
have an impact on the SCB and its resources (including the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary) significant
enough to require a DEIS.

 As required by CEQ regulations, NMFS considered ``the degree to which the effects (of the proposed action) on the quality
of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial'' as a factor in determining whether the intensity
of the proposed action would make it ``significant.'' Because NMFS' review of the best available scientific information
led to the conclusion in the EA that the proposed detonations will have a negligible impact on marine mammals and other
marine resources, the fact that the commenters did not provide any new or contradictory scientific information regarding
such impacts reaffirms NMFS' conclusion that there is no real scientifically-based controversy about the effects
of the proposed action sufficient to change NMFS' conclusion that the proposed action would not have a significant
impact on the human environment such that preparation of a DEIS would be warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Navy's ship shock testing may be opposed by many members of the public, much of that objection is due to philosophical
differences of opinion rather than objective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientifically- or factually-based controversy over what will be the effects of such testing on the environment.
NMFS believes that the rulemaking shows that the issuance of a small take authorization to the Navy would not have effects
(intensity) that are ``highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks'' significant enough to require a DEIS.
In the EA and in the Navy's small take application, the level of scientific uncertainty has been substantially lessened
by incorporating scientifically acceptable environmental prediction methods as necessary. In addition, mitigation
and monitoring measures incorporated into the LOA and regulations substantially moderate potential impacts from
ship shock testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter states that ``among those who are criticizing the proposed detonations are knowledgeable scientists
with years of experience studying affected species.'' However, other than those scientists submitting comments
that have been addressed in this section, because independent scientists neither submitted significant comments
addressing the science upon which the small take authorization is based when information was requested during the
June 1993 comment period, nor as a result of the EA and proposed rule, NMFS is unaware of either the reasons for their
purported criticism or contrary scientific evidence to support their position.

: The same commenter, noted that by granting the Navy's permit application, NMFS will establish a (dangerous) precedent
for future action with significant effects. The commenter was concerned that future applications would require
no more than was done for this application even though mitigation efforts are highly questionable as to effectiveness
and that there would be no incentive for the Navy to develop more accurate detection methods (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(6)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: NMFS disagrees with this assessment. The mitigation measures (survey for low animal abundance areas, aerial surveys,
go/no-go determination, post-detonation surveys etc.) required under these regulations are considered adequate
to detect marine mammals and other marine life and limit incidental takings to the lowest possible number. In addition,
the ship shock test small take authorization will be reviewed at least annually to make a determination that the taking
continues to comply with section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA. While the mitigation measures in these regulations may seem
``questionable'' to some commenters, practical alternative methods for detecting marine mammals have not been
recommended (see response under ``Mitigation''). Moreover, future Navy applications for a small take authorization
under the MMPA will be judged on the adequacy of the documentation submitted, not on previous actions, such as this
one.

Certain impacts, while insignificant individually, are significant when considered cumulatively (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(7)).

NMFS did not review the proposed action as a 1-year authorization; it reviewed it as a 5-year authorization period,
and therefore evaluated the cumulative impacts of the proposed activity over 5 years. As stated in the EA, the cumulative
impact on marine mammals from ship shock tests over the 5-year authorization period of the regulations will be negligible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, ship shock testing (in combination with other military explosives detonation projects) would not have a significant
impact, either singly or cumulatively, on the marine environment of the SCB over the 5-year authorization period.
The infrequency of the large-charge tests and the minimal impact of the small charges are two additional reasons for
this determination.

NMFS does not concur. While ship shock testing may result in the non-lethal injury or harassment of endangered marine
mammals, this level of incidental take will not result in the mortality of listed marine mammals or result in jeopardizing
the continued existence of these species. (Refer to the Biological Opinion for additional information). The estimated
numbers of incidental takes are given and assessed in the EA. Although sperm whales, because of their abundance and
deep-diving behavior, may be subject to a ``high incidental take,'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
six non-lethal injuries and 20 harassment takes if they are in the area on each and every test) there will not be a ``high
incidental killing'' of sperm whales as the commenter states. With a California population size of 857 and a North
Pacific population size of 930,000, these takes are considered ``small'' and will not be a significant impact on the
stock. Moreover, the OSTR has not been designated ``critical habitat'' for any listed species. Individual injured
animals would be expected to recover. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is less information available on sea turtles in the SCB than marine mammals, as discussed in the EA. Due to the
less effective ability of aerial overflights to detect some species of sea turtles, the Navy admits that some sea turtles
may be injured or possibly killed during explosives detonation. However, based upon mortalities observed in other
tests in an area of presumably higher sea turtle abundance than the SCB, and because recent research (cited in the EA)
indicates that sea turtles are less susceptible to injury from explosives than marine mammals, few sea turtles are
likely to be killed or seriously injured. Although post-test monitoring efforts may not be totally effective in determining
impacts to sea turtles, the monitoring program will try to determine whether sea turtles are in fact incidentally
killed and, if so, whether practical modifications are available to improve detection and/or to reduce impacts.
Also, because of the great depth of the water at the test location, several species, such as coastal inhabiting, bottom-feeding
and coral-feeding species, would be expected to be uncommon or rarely seen in the area. (Contrary to one commenter's
observation, even though sea turtle species are listed as endangered or threatened, some species are sufficiently
abundant in certain areas and times to be considered more than ``rare,'' (

area.'' This same commenter and another commenter stated that ``NEPA and the MMPA require public participation and
hearings.'' One commenter also noted that ``the marine scientific community should have provided a greater role
in assessing the impacts of the proposed action.'' Another listed the names of several scientists, who were unaware
of the public hearings or that the Navy proposed to begin ship shock trials in February 1994.

southern California newspapers. A press release noting the proposed rule and the meeting times and locations was
also issued. NMFS believes that it has complied with both the spirit and the letter of NEPA, NOAA Directives implementing

The location for the Long Beach public meeting was chosen because it was considered central to the affected area (i.e.,
the SCB). Those unable to attend the meeting were invited to submit written comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not possible for NMFS to have advance knowledge of all individuals interested in its activities, although it
is noted that none of the individuals listed in one commenter's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 8, 1993, testimony contacted NMFS to obtain the documentation for review or submitted comments after being
informed by the commenter of the proposed action. In addition, at least one of these individuals received a copy of
the Navy application in June. The marine scientific community has had sufficient opportunity to become involved
in this process.

Many commenters believe that NMFS should have made more of an effort to locate alternative sites as required by NEPA.
One commenter believed that NMFS must evaluate the proposed site in concert with other possible sites. One commenter
asserts that NMFS has not considered previously used sites. Another commenter believed that the MMPA required NMFS
to evaluate alternate sites to ensure the least practicable adverse impact upon affected species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the EA was to evaluate the impact of the proposed issuance of a small take authorization to the Navy to
incidentally take marine mammals within the OSTR. Under that Federal action, NMFS identified two alternatives,
in addition to the proposal. The alternatives to the proposal were to issue the LOA without mitigation requirements
and to not issue a small take authorization, the no action alternative. Alternatives such as alternative sites or
methods were identified as being beyond the scope of the proposed action. Because NMFS is not authorizing the detonation
of explosives, only the proposed taking of marine mammals incidental to such detonations, NMFS is of the opinion that
the site determination and method of operation is the responsibility of the Navy (provided NMFS is assured that there
was not a practicable alternative to ship shock testing that would result in not taking marine mammals). As stated
in the EA, if a Small Take LOA is not given to the Navy (no action alternative), because the take was either not small or
would result in more than a negligible impact to the species, then the Navy could elect to relocate the test site or take
some other action. Refer to the response under the ``Outer Sea Test Range'' below for additional discussion on this
topic.

The Navy will be utilizing survey data collected in 1993 to limit the test site within the OSTR to an area with few or no
marine mammals. Current aerial survey data will be used to ``reduce'' the test area to a site that will minimize potential
impacts to marine mammals. Arbitrarily limiting the test area to a particular corner or area of the OSTR at this stage
would be premature, and may not result in reduced impacts to marine mammals and other marine life.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS should consider such alternatives such as a reduction in the number of detonations; the sizes of detonations;
and, the period in which detonations are allowed. Additionally, NMFS must give due consideration to alternative
forms of testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the Navy's application, the estimated number of large detonations is extremely conservative, and based
on an extreme worst case scenario. To ensure conservatism, the Navy multiplied its worst case scenario by 5 (years)
to determine the absolute maximum take during the 5-year term of the LOA. It is highly unlikely that the Navy will detonate
60 large charges during the 5-year period. However, there is justification, although remote, for requiring up to
12 detonations on an annual basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four shots of gradually increasing severity maximizes safety, technical benefits, and economics. Small increases
in severity between shots raises confidence in predicting the potential for unforeseen hazards from one shot to the
next. Experience, careful planning, and examination of objectives and constraints resolved that 4 shots is the optimum
procedure for conducting a shock trial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a ship the size of an AEGIS-class destroyer, a 10,000 lb. (4,536 kg) charge is necessary to produce a nearly planar
shock wave. A plane wave generates nearly uniform loading on each shot, which is required when measuring responses
from thousands of reaction points around the ship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time there is no scientific evidence to indicate that there is any one period of the year when marine mammals
are not within the OSTR. Population assessment research in the SCB will be reviewed to determine if seasonal restrictions
would result in lower incidental takes. If so, then NMFS would likely take actions necessary to ensure the greatest
protection to these marine mammals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where feasible, the Navy conducts underwater explosives tests using computer modeling and land-based test facilities.
Two contractor-operated quarries in Virginia are used for some of the test work. In addition, a test pond has been constructed
at the Army Combat Systems Test Activity in Aberdeen, MD. These facilities are limited to testing small and medium
size components on floating platforms. Ponds, like those at Aberdeen and in Virginia reduce the need for testing in
the ocean. It is impossible, however, to eliminate the need for open-water testing for programs such as full-scale
ship shock trials.

One commenter believed that it would be ``better and wiser to wait, if at all possible, until the [computer-model]
technology is perfected than to gamble so much on the current imperfections of the [ship shock trial] technology.''

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the EA, the ``no action'' alternative is unacceptable to the Navy as the ``Live Fire'' testing program
is required by the National Defense Authorization Act (10 U.S.C. 139). By law, ships and critical components or systems
constructed for the Navy must undergo shock tests prior to service with the fleet to determine the integrity of the
structure and electronic systems that are vital to the overall function and performance of the vessel and crew under
wartime combat conditions. While full-scale testing is minimized by the use of laboratory tests and calculations,
the Navy believes that it is essential to have large-scale tests at sea to determine total system response. The alternative
of not testing at all would expose the ship and its crew to its first real test under hostile fire. It is the Navy's judgement
that this is not the appropriate time nor place to determine that a component or system fails a test. While alternatives
are theoretically possible, they have not been developed to the point of practical application.

There is no evidence that the offshore SCB area is an especially important area for feeding, although it is known that
some of the larger whales tend to prefer the Patton Escarpment area and may migrate along it. NMFS review of the best
available scientific information indicates that impacts on food sources and migratory routes however, would be
minimal and would not result in a long-term impact.

Several commenters were concerned about the potential for taking California sea otters and that the Navy has not applied
to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) for an incidental take authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the EA accompanying the proposed rule, an incidental take of sea otters has not been requested because sea
otters are coastal animals found north of San Luis Obispo, CA, that prefer to remain within a few kilometers of the coast.
Those sea otters inhabiting San Nicolas Island as a result of the USFWS' translocation efforts are unlikely to be within
the OSTR. The Navy will be consulting with USFWS on their activity under section 7 of the ESA.

via aerial surveys and that most gray whales (78 percent of cow-calf pairs and 94 percent of all other whales) were within
3 nm (5.6 km) of the islands. Animals classified by researchers as ``calves of the season'' comprised nearly 12 percent
of the raw counts. Ninety-four percent of the cow-calf pairs were seen east of Santa Rosa Island. It should also be noted
that pregnant gray whales are in the vanguard of the south-bound migration and, because they give birth from January
to mid-February in and near the lagoons in Baja California, should have migrated south through the SCB by February,
the time of the proposed testing.

Response:

The Navy made a determination not to request an incidental take authorization for Guadalupe fur seals and Steller
sea lions because their population sizes in the SCB (one to five fur seals and 100 sea lions) were low and that mitigation
measures would likely detect these species if an individual was there. In the event a Guadalupe fur seal or a Steller
sea lion is taken, such taking would be in violation of the MMPA (and the LOA). Alternatively, if one is seen in the area
prior to the test but not taken because the test is delayed until the animal leaves, then the Navy may elect to request
an amendment to its LOA and the authorizing regulations for future tests.

The EA listed the criteria that the Navy established for locating ship shock trials. Refer to that document for a list
of these criteria. However, it should be recognized that the Pacific Missile Range is an oceanic area designated for
military activities since it was established by the Department of Defense in 1946. According to the Navy, the OSTR
has been used for ship shock trials since 1990. The only other West Coast site where ship shock trials of this magnitude
have been conducted is within a military operations area east of San Clemente Island. However, since 1990, environmental
concerns and the large number of fleet operations (greater than 200,000 per year), preclude the use of this area for
ship shock trials. Thus, this alternative was eliminated from further consideration by the Navy. For a discussion
on utilizing portions of the OSTR, refer to similar concerns under ``National Environmental Policy Act Concerns''
above and ``Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary Concerns'' below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that the San Juan Seamount is approximately 12 nm west of the western boundary of the OSTR. Because
the 2-nm safety zone will be within the OSTR, at a minimum, the test site will be 14 nm from the eastern slope of the seamount.
The Navy believes, and NMFS concurs, that there will be little or no impact on the resources of the seamount.

For the ship shock trials, the explosive is not allowed to free fall through the water column but is towed to the site,
armed, buoyed at the appropriate depth (125 ft (38 m) or 200 ft (61 m) depending upon the charge weight) and detonated.
Unexploded ordnance is towed to a deep-water site for safe disposal.

Many reviewers commented on the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and the impacts that they believe the ship
shock testing will have on the marine life within the sanctuary. One commenter stated that the contiguous line drawn
between the two territorial sea limits was only 6 miles (9.6 km) from the sanctuary at Santa Barbara. This commenter
believed the shock tests could have a negative effect on the marine mammals and seabirds that inhabit the Sanctuary.
The commenter goes on to state that both noise and concussions generated from the test could, at the least, startle
and disrupt pinnipeds, cetaceans and seabirds within the Sanctuary, and at the worst, the concussions could injure
or kill these creatures. This commenter recommended that NMFS require the Navy to conduct ship shock trials south
of latitude 33
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->

Response:

There is no evidence that ship shock tests, conducted within the OSTR will impact the resources of the Channel Islands
National Marine Sanctuary, and commenters have not offered contrary documentation (refer to related comment under
``Mitigation and Monitoring'' above). While the actual ship shock test site will likely be upwards of 50 nm from the
outer boundary of the Sanctuary (in the southwestern portion of the OSTR), the northeastern boundary of the OSTR is
located no closer than 6 nm (11.1 km) from the outer perimeter of the Sanctuary, a distance greater than calculated
for onset of all types of take except acoustic harassment at significant water depths. As mentioned previously, the
Navy will be utilizing NMFS' 1993 marine mammal survey data to limit the test site within the OSTR to an area with few
or no marine mammals. This current aerial survey data will be used to ``reduce'' the test area to a site that will minimize
potential impacts to marine mammals. Arbitrarily limiting the test area to a particular area of the OSTR at this stage
would be premature, and may not result in reduced impacts to marine mammals and other marine life.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations and LOA authorizing the incidental taking require the Navy to allow NMFS personnel onboard vessels
and aircraft during ship shock trials and other operations using explosives within the OSTR. NMFS authority does
not extend to requiring the Navy to be subject to an oversight committee of citizens. The comment has been forwarded
to the Navy for consideration.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asserted that if the LOA is issued, ``a financial bonus will accrue to the Southwest Fisheries Science
Center in La Jolla. This represents a clear conflict of interest on the part of NMFS. The appearance of a conflict could
have been mitigated had other entities with marine mammal monitoring experience been requested to bid; that would
also have resulted in the lowest cost estimate by SWFSC, which had no incentive to trim its cost estimate and which will
have no incentive to limit actual costs to an amount less than the estimated costs.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS does not concur with this assessment. The Navy, in 1992, made preliminary inquiries regarding the cost of conducting
marine mammal surveys with private entities experienced in marine mammal surveys, in addition to the NMFS' SWFSC.
The Navy independently determined that NMFS would be able to conduct the surveys at approximately one-third the cost
of the other groups contacted. With that determination made, the Navy made an inter-agency transfer of funds to NMFS
to conduct the surveys and post-test monitoring. The SWFSC proposal was included in the application of the Navy for
a small take authorization and available therefor for review and comment at that time. No comments were received on
the proposal.

Description of Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subject regulations govern the incidental taking of marine mammals during the detonation of conventional explosives
in the OSTR off Pt. Mugu, CA. The regulations are based on the entire rulemaking record including evidence submitted
in an application from the Navy that the detonation of conventional explosives off the Channel Islands, CA, over the
next 5 years may involve the incidental taking (harassment, injury or death) of marine mammals. NMFS has determined
that the total taking will involve small numbers of marine mammals and will have a negligible impact on the species
for which the take is requested, their habitat, and the availability of these species for subsistence uses. Although
two of the species of pinnipeds on the Channel Islands, the northern fur seal and the harbor seal, are taken for subsistence
in Alaska, an incidental take from the populations in the Channel Islands would not reduce the availability of these
species for subsistence in Alaska. Therefore, NMFS has determined that this incidental taking will not have an unmitigable
adverse impact on the availability of marine mammals for subsistence by Alaska natives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations apply only to Navy projects involving the underwater detonation of conventional explosives in the
offshore waters of the OSTR of the NAWC, off Pt. Mugu, Ventura County, CA. All activities must be conducted in a manner
that minimizes adverse effects on marine mammals authorized to be taken and their habitat and in conformance with
any requirements in a LOA issued under these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these regulations NMFS is issuing the Navy a 1-year LOA. This LOA is the official document allowing the incidental
taking of marine mammals. It will be renewed annually upon receipt of a report detailing activities conducted during
the previous 12 months, including levels of taking of marine mammals, provided the required mitigation measures
are undertaken and the annual taking authorizations are not exceeded. If a species' annual authorization is exceeded,
NMFS will review the documentation submitted with the annual report to ensure that the taking continues to have no
more than a negligible impact on the species or stock involved.

The annual report must be submitted to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), at least 120 days prior
to the date of expiration of the annual LOA in order for issuance of a LOA for the following year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any substantive changes to the conditions contained within the annual LOA, including suspension or withdrawal,
over the 5-year period the regulations are in effect will be subject to public review and comment unless NMFS determines
that an emergency exists that necessitates immediate action. Whether changes are ``substantive'' will be determined
by the AA. The regulations require the holder of the LOA to cooperate with NMFS and any other Federal, state or local
agency monitoring impacts resulting from this activity on these species. At its discretion, NMFS will place observers
onboard either the fleet tug or the target vessel, or both, and on any ship or aircraft involved in marine mammal reconnaissance
and monitoring either prior to, during, or after explosives detonation.

Effects of Military Testing Activities on Marine Mammals

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Potential impacts to marine mammals from explosives detonation include exposure to chemical by-products, lethal
and injurious incidental take, as well as physical and acoustic harassment. Injury or death could occur as a direct
result of the explosive blast (concussion) and resultant cavitation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Injury could include damage to internal organs and/or the auditory system. Non-injurious harassment of marine
mammals could occur as a result of physiological response to both the explosion-generated shockwave as well as to
the acoustic signature of the detonation. Based upon information provided by the Navy, NMFS believes it is unlikely
that injury will occur from exposure to the chemical by-products released into the surface waters.

 The area of cavitation is where the water pressure becomes extremely low with the passage of the negative shock wave
that moves down from the surface. The water separates, producing a region of cavitation bubbles for a brief time. This
region of cavitation bubbles then collapses and generates a weak positive pressure wave.

Measures to Reduce Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the highly mobile nature of ship shock tests, successful avoidance of, or reduction in, the incidental
taking of marine mammals is dependent upon the detection of marine mammals. Extensive pre-test surveys in the test
area are being conducted to document on-range marine mammal seasonal abundance and to detect areas of high mammal
density. Three 80-nm2 (275-km2) areas for ship shock tests will be identified prior to each test based on an analysis
of the 1993 NMFS 12-month aerial survey results and historical marine mammal survey data. Intensive aerial surveys
will be flown in the three targeted areas 1 month prior to the first scheduled shock test and the areas will subsequently
be ranked from low to high with respect to marine mammal density. An intensive survey will be conducted in the primary
test area 2 days prior to each scheduled shock test. If scientists determine that marine mammal density is higher than
previously predicted, the alternate secondary and tertiary areas will be surveyed to determine their short-term
suitability for shock tests.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On test days, extensive aerial and surface surveillance will be conducted to monitor for the presence, behavior and
condition of marine mammals before and after each detonation. Pre- and post-detonation aerial reconnaissance surveys
will be conducted from a fixed-wing aircraft, Navy helicopters, and from the test vessel. If marine mammals, sea turtles,
or endangered or threatened seabirds are seen within the 2-nm (3.7-km)-radius safety zone (for the 10,000-lb. (4,536-kg)
charge), detonation of the charge will be delayed until the animals exit the safety zone. Tests will not be conducted
if marine mammals, sea turtles, seabird flocks or fish schools are detected within the safety zone. Also, tests will
not be conducted when weather or sea conditions preclude adequate aerial surveillance. No detonations will be permitted
without the concurrence of the NAWC Ecologist assigned to the program as the Environmental Coordinator. Any dead
marine mammals and turtles seen by aerial survey observers during the pre-test (48 hours prior to test) aerial survey
of one or more of the three 80-nm2 (275-km2) will be documented and marked/tagged by MART, onboard an independent recovery
vessel, so that those animals that were dead prior to the ship shock test will not be included in incidental take numbers
reported to NMFS after the trial. Full necropsies will not be performed on these animals, although tissues may be collected
if time permits.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After each detonation, an aerial reconnaissance survey of the ship shock test zone, to 3 nm (5.6 km) radial distance
from the detonation, will be conducted by NMFS SWFSC scientists who will notify the MART personnel if any dead or injured
marine animals are seen. The occurrence of live marine mammals, seabirds and sea turtles will also be documented by
aerial and vessel survey personnel. Under the direction of a Navy marine mammal veterinarian, examination and recovery
of any dead or injured animals will be undertaken by MART. Necropsies will be performed and tissue samples taken by
MART's veterinary staff from any dead marine mammals or sea turtles. Activities related to the monitoring of the Navy
ship shock program will be authorized under these regulations and will not require a separate permit under section
104 of the MMPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If post-test surveys determine that an injurious or lethal take of a marine mammal has occurred, the test procedure
and the monitoring methods will be reviewed by the Navy and NMFS and appropriate changes may be made. Inter-agency
coordination between the Navy and NMFS/SWFSC will ensure that the tests will proceed by the safest possible means.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within 90 days after any detonation project, the Navy will have to submit a summary report to NMFS. This report must
include the following information: (1) Date and time of the test; (2) a summary of the pre-test and post-test activities
related to mitigating and monitoring the effects of explosives detonation on marine mammal populations; and (3)
the results of the monitoring program, including numbers by species/stock of any marine mammals noted injured or
killed as a result of the detonation and numbers that may have been harassed due to presence within the safety zone.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An annual report must be submitted by the Navy to NMFS at least 120 days prior to the date of expiration of the annual LOA
in order for issuance of a LOA for the following year. This annual report must contain: (1) The date and time of all tests
conducted during the previous calendar year; (2) a description of all pre-test and post-test activities related
to mitigating and monitoring the effects of explosives detonation on marine mammal populations; (3) the results
of the post-test monitoring program, including numbers by species/stock of any marine mammals noted injured or killed
as a result of the detonation and numbers that may have been harassed due to presence within the safety zone; and (4)
the results of population assessment studies conducted by Navy or contract scientists, if any, made on marine mammals

NMFS will renew the LOA annually upon timely receipt of the summary and annual reports, a determination that the maximum
incidental take authorizations were not exceeded, and that the mitigation measures were undertaken. If one or more
species' lethal or serious injury take levels were reached or exceeded during the previous year, NMFS will require
the holder of the LOA to provide additional documentation, as may be requested, on the taking, including the results
of the required reviews of the ship shock test procedure and the monitoring methods and any measures that will be undertaken
in the following year to prevent exceeding the authorized incidental take levels in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While NMFS believes that detonation of the larger (i.e., 1,200- and 10,000-lb. (544- and 4,536-kg)) charges may affect
some marine mammals, the latest abundance and distribution estimates, based on the best available scientific information,
indicate that the taking will have no more than a negligible impact on the populations of marine mammals inhabiting
the waters of the SCB. NMFS concurs with the Navy that impacts can be mitigated by mandating conservative safety zones
for marine mammal exclusion, incorporating an active aerial survey monitoring effort in the program both prior to,
and after detonation of explosives, and provided tests are not conducted whenever marine mammals are detected within
the testing zone, or if weather and sea conditions preclude adequate aerial surveillance.

zone of the State of California, a State with an approved coastal zone management program under the Coastal Zone Management
Act (CZMA). However, aerial monitoring and other mitigation measures that will be employed by the Navy prior to, and
during, testing will result in a negligible impact on marine mammals and other marine life. The Navy will be submitting
a consistency determination for this activity to the State of California's Division of Governmental Coordination
for review pursuant to the CZMA section 307(c)(1) and 15 CFR part 930, subpart C. The Navy, under 15 CFR 930.40 (multiple
Federal agency participation), will be the lead Federal agency for CZMA Federal consistency purposes.

(4) 10 detonations of 10 lbs (4.5 kg); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 20 detonations of 1 lb (0.45 kg), provided all terms, conditions, and requirements of these regulations and such
Letter of Authorization are complied with. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The activity identified in paragraph (a) of this section must be conducted in a manner that minimizes, to the greatest
extent possible, adverse impacts on marine mammals and their habitat. When detonating explosives, the following
mitigation measures must be utilized: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If marine mammals are observed within the designated safety zone prescribed in the Letter of Authorization, or
on a course that will put them within the safety zone prior to detonation, detonation must be delayed until the marine
mammals are no longer within the safety zone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If weather and/or sea conditions preclude adequate aerial surveillance, detonation must be delayed until conditions
improve sufficiently for aerial surveillance to be undertaken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If post-test surveys determine that an injurious or lethal take of a marine mammal has occurred, the test procedure
and the monitoring methods must be reviewed and appropriate changes must be made prior to conducting the next project.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The holder of the Letter of Authorization is required to cooperate with the National Marine Fisheries Service
and any other Federal, state or local agency monitoring the impacts of the activity on marine mammals. The holder must
notify the Director, Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 501 West Ocean Boulevard, suite 4200,
Long Beach, CA (Telephone: (310) 980&hyph;4001), at least 2 weeks prior to activities involving the detonation of
explosives in order to satisfy paragraph (f) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The holder of the Letter of Authorization must designate a qualified on-site individual(s) to record the effects
of explosives detonation on marine mammals that inhabit the Outer Sea Test Range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The primary test area, and if necessary, secondary and tertiary test areas, in the Outer Sea Test Range, must be
surveyed by marine mammal biologists and other trained individuals, and the marine mammal populations monitored,
approximately 48 hours prior to a scheduled detonation, on the day of detonation, and for a period of time specified
in the Letter of Authorization after each test or project. Monitoring shall include, but not necessarily be limited
to, aerial surveillance sufficient to ensure that no marine mammals are within the designated safety zone nor are
likely to enter the designated safety zone prior to or at the time of detonation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) (1) Under the direction of a certified marine mammal veterinarian, examination and recovery of any dead or injured
marine mammals will be conducted. Necropsies will be performed and tissue samples taken from any dead animals. After
completion of the necropsy, animals not retained for shoreside examination, will be tagged and returned to the sea.
The occurrence of live marine mammals will also be documented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Activities related to the monitoring described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section or the Letter of Authorization
issued under this part may include the retention of marine mammals without the need for a separate scientific research
permit. The use of such marine mammals in other scientific research may be authorized pursuant to 50 CFR parts 216 and
220. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) At its discretion, the National Marine Fisheries Service may place an observer on either the towing vessel, target
vessel, or both, and on any ship or aircraft involved in marine mammal reconnaissance, or monitoring either prior
to, during, or after explosives detonation in order to monitor the impact on marine mammals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) A summary report must be submitted to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, within 90 days after the
conclusion of any explosives detonation project. This report must include the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Date and time of the test(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A summary of the pre-test and post-test activities related to mitigating and monitoring the effects of explosives
detonation on marine mammal populations; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Results of the monitoring program, including numbers by species/stock of any marine mammals noted injured or
killed as a result of the detonation and numbers that may have been harassed due to presence within the safety zone.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) An annual report must be submitted to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, no later than 120 days prior
to the date of expiration of the annual Letter of Authorization in order for issuance of a Letter of Authorization for
the following year. This annual report must contain the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Date and time of all tests conducted under the expiring Letter of Authorization;

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NOAA issues this final rule to implement gear requirements for vessels fishing for northern shrimp in the Northeast
multispecies fishery during the 1993/94 fishing season. Vessels fishing for or possessing northern shrimp in the
U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and all Federally permitted fishing vessels fishing for or possessing northern
shrimp are required to install and use a finfish excluder device throughout the fishing season and throughout the
range. The intent of this requirement is to reduce the bycatch of groundfish in the small-mesh northern shrimp fishery.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations implementing Amendment 4 (56 FR 24724, May 31, 1991) to the Fishery Management Plan for the Northeast
Multispecies Fishery (FMP) include a measure that requires the New England Fishery Management Council (Council)
to make necessary recommendations to the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), on gear requirements
for vessels fishing for northern shrimp.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council's recommendation for the 1993/94 fishery that any vessel catching, harvesting or landing northern shrimp
be required to use a finfish excluder device, particularly the Nordmore Grate (grate), with a rigid or semi-rigid
bar spacing of not more than one inch (2.54 cm), throughout the shrimp season, was published on November 8, 1993 (58
FR 59232). The notice also provided a summary of an economic analysis contained in an environmental assessment prepared
by the Council to accompany its recommendation. The publication of the recommendation initiated a comment period,
which concluded on December 3, 1993.

A comment on the Council's recommendation was received from the Center for Marine Conservation, which supported
approval of the Council's recommendation.

Changes From the Proposed Rule to the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes were made to all of the sections under &sect;651.20(b)(3)(vi), inclusive, to conform to the finfish excluder
device requirement as published in the proposed rule to Amendment 5 to the multispecies FMP (58 FR 57774). All of the
changes are for clarity and brevity. No substantive changes were made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action is authorized by 50 CFR part 651 and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that the proposed rule,
if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As a result, a regulatory
flexibility analysis was not prepared.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined that it is impracticable and contrary to the public
interest to delay for 30 days the effective date of this rule under section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure
Act. Fishermen harvesting northern shrimp already are required to use Nordmore grates in state waters of Maine, New
Hampshire, and Massachusetts and have had ample time to adjust to this requirement. Implementation of this same requirement
in the EEZ provides similar requirements for fishermen throughout the range of the fishery.

(vi) Pursuant to &sect;651.20(b)(3)(iv), beginning January 31, 1994, any vessel issued a permit under &sect;651.4
that is fishing for, harvesting, possessing or landing northern shrimp, and any vessel fishing for, catching, harvesting
or possessing northern shrimp in the EEZ, must have a properly configured and installed finfish excluder device in
any net used to fish for or harvest northern shrimp, throughout the northern shrimp season as established or modified
by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. The finfish excluder device must be configured and installed
consistent with the following specifications (see Figure 6 for an example of a properly configured and installed
finfish excluder device):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The finfish excluder device must be a rigid or semi-rigid grate consisting of parallel bars of not more than 1 inch
(2.54 cm) spacing that excludes all fish and other objects, except those that are small enough to pass between its bars
into the codend of the trawl.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The finfish excluder device must be secured in the trawl, forward of the codend, in such a manner that it precludes
the passage of fish or other objects into the codend without said fish or objects have first passed between the bars
of the grate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A fish outlet or hole must be provided to allow fish or other objects that are too large to pass between the bars of
the grate to pass out of the net. The aftermost edge of this outlet must be at least as wide as the grate at the point of attachment.
Said fish outlet must extend forward from the grate toward the mouth of the net.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) A funnel of net material is allowed in the lengthening piece of the net forward of the grate to direct catch towards
the grate.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is issuing this interim final rule to revise its asbestos Model Accreditation Plan (MAP) to clarify the types of
persons who must be accredited to work with asbestos in schools and public and commercial buildings; to increase the
minimum number of hours of training, including additional hours of hands-on health and safety training, for asbestos
abatement workers and contractor/supervisors; and to effect a variety of other necessary changes as mandated by
section 15(a)(3) of the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA). This revised rule replaces
the original MAP found at 40 CFR part 763, Appendix C to Subpart E. The original MAP contained six components which,
taken together, comprised a model asbestos accreditation plan for States and EPA-approved training providers.
These components included: (1) Initial training, (2) examinations, (3) refresher training, (4) qualifications,
(5) decertification requirements, and (6) reciprocity. This revision adds two new components to the original MAP;
(1) definitions, which help to determine the scope and applicability of the rule, and (2) new recordkeeping requirements
for the providers of accredited training courses. The changes also specify the deadline for States to modify their
accreditation programs to be no less stringent than the revised MAP as required by the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA) section 206(b)(2). Further, the revised MAP prescribes deadlines for training course providers and persons
who must obtain accreditation to comply with new requirements; distinguishes between the training requirements
for each of the five accredited training disciplines; adds several new topics to the project designer training curriculum;
establishes new enforcement criteria and Federal procedures for withdrawing approval from accredited persons
and training programs; and stipulates new information requirements for training certificates. Because the revisions
expand the minimum requirements for an accreditation plan, States may have to modify their programs to insure that
each State has a contractor accreditation plan that is at least as stringent as the revised MAP as required by TSCA section
206(b). Similarly, training providers may need to adjust their training course administration or curricula to comply
with the revised MAP. Finally, EPA has modified the organization, and some of the language of the original MAP. These
modifications, however, are technical, and do not impose new substantive requirements.

 This Rule is effective April 4, 1994. Because this is an interim final rule, EPA is accepting further comment on this

The Agency is requesting comment on this revised MAP only to the extent that it has amended or changed the original MAP.
The Agency is not soliciting comments on provisions of the original MAP that remain unaffected by this action. Specifically,
and notwithstanding the inclusion of some of the existing language from the original MAP in this revised MAP, the Agency
will only entertain comments to the extent that they address actual changes which have been incorporated. Appendix
C to subpart E of 40 CFR 763 is reproduced in its entirety solely for clarity and to facilitate understanding of how the
changes and amendments fit within the existing regulatory structure.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1986, Congress enacted the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA, or TSCA Title II) which mandated a regulatory
program to address asbestos hazards in schools. A part of AHERA (section 206; 15 U.S.C. 2646) dealt with the mandatory
training and accreditation of persons who would perform certain types of asbestos-related work in schools. Subsequently,
in 1990, Congress enacted ASHARA (Pub. L. 101&hyph;637), which amended AHERA to extend some of the training and accreditation
requirements to persons performing such work in public and commercial buildings. Consequently, EPA is now effecting
regulatory changes to reflect and implement these statutory amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Originally, section 206 of AHERA required EPA to develop a MAP providing for the training of certain types of persons
performing asbestos-related work in elementary and secondary schools (15 U.S.C. 2646). Persons covered by this
original MAP included those who inspected school buildings for asbestos-containing materials (ACM); developed
asbestos management plans for schools; and designed or conducted response actions with respect to friable ACM, other
than small-scale, short-duration activities, in schools. Such persons were required to obtain accreditation as
a prerequisite to performing this work. AHERA also required States to adopt a State accreditation program that was
no less stringent than that described in the MAP (15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(2)). Persons could then obtain accreditation
by completing either an EPA-approved training course, or a training course approved by a State with a program that
was at least as stringent as the MAP, and by passing an examination for that course. Individual States, however, could
elect to impose more stringent requirements as a condition of accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original MAP established five accredited ``disciplines'' for asbestos-related activities in schools, which
included: worker, contractor/supervisor, inspector, management planner, and project designer. For each discipline,
it outlined a functional role and set of job responsibilities, and stipulated minimum training, examination, and
continuing education requirements. It established areas of knowledge of asbestos inspection, management plan
development, and response action technology that persons seeking accreditation must demonstrate and that States
must include in their accreditation programs. On November 28, 1990, Congress enacted ASHARA and expanded the accreditation
requirements to apply to persons who work with asbestos in public and commercial buildings as well as schools. Specifically,
ASHARA expanded TSCA section 206(a)(1) and (3) to require accreditation for any person who inspects for ACM in a public
and commercial building, or who designs or conducts a response action with respect to friable ACM in such a building.
As a result of this amendment, the MAP accreditation requirements for inspectors, project designers, workers, and
contractor/supervisors now apply equally to persons in both schools and public and commercial buildings. Congress,
however, did not extend the accreditation requirement for management planners. As a result, TSCA requires accreditation
for persons who prepare management plans if they work in schools, but does not require such accreditation if they work
in public and commercial buildings (15 U.S.C. 2646(a)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHARA also required EPA to revise the current MAP by increasing the minimum number of hours of training, including
hands-on training, required for asbestos abatement workers in both schools and public and commercial buildings.
ASHARA, however, did not specify the amount of additional training that would be required. In addition, ASHARA authorized
EPA to modify the MAP as necessary to implement the extension of accreditation requirements to public and commercial
buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, ASHARA amended the penalty provisions of TSCA section 207 (15 U.S.C. 2647). It provided for a civil penalty
for contractors who fail to comply with TSCA accreditation requirements by inspecting, designing, or conducting
a response action in a school or public or commercial building without TSCA accreditation, or by employing individuals
to conduct response actions in such a building, and failing to require or provide TSCA accreditation for the employees.
A contractor who commits a violation is liable for a civil penalty of $5,000 for each day of a violation, except for a
contractor who is a direct employee of the Federal Government (15 U.S.C. 2646 (g)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASHARA accreditation provisions originally were to take effect on November 28, 1991. ASHARA, however, authorized
EPA's Administrator to extend that effective date for one year. On January 7, 1992, the Administrator took action
to extend the effective date until November 28, 1992 (57 FR 1913, January 16, 1992). The Administrator determined
that accredited asbestos contractors were needed to perform school site abatement required under AHERA, and that
such an extension was necessary to ensure effective implementation of section 203 of TSCA (ASHARA section 15(c)).
As a result of this extension, persons who perform inspections, or plan or conduct response actions in public and commercial
buildings were required to obtain TSCA accreditation beginning on November 28, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided to phase-in the other new requirements contained in the revised MAP when the revision takes effect.
These requirements include an increase in the minimum number of hours of training, including hands-on training,
for asbestos abatement workers in both schools and public and commercial buildings, and other necessary revisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is promulgating the revised MAP as an interim final rule that will take effect 60 days after the rule is published.
The streamlined procedures that EPA has utilized to revise the MAP are fully consistent with the Congressional directive
to EPA for developing the original MAP. AHERA specifically authorized the Agency to issue the MAP ``after consultation
with affected parties'' (15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(1)(A)). EPA issued it after a public request for information in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (51 FR 28914, August 12, 1986) and consultations with affected parties, but without engaging in full-scale notice
and comment rulemaking. EPA has used procedures to revise the MAP that are as extensive as those that were used to develop
the original MAP. EPA believes it is reasonable to conclude that Congress did not intend EPA to engage in the redundancy
of consultation with affected parties and formal notice and comment rulemaking in either issuing the MAP or in revising
it, and therefore intended EPA to issue this revision to the MAP after undertaking similar consultations with affected
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA finds that there is good cause to issue an interim final rule, without utilizing all of the notice and public comment
procedures in section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), because those procedures are impracticable
and unnecessary under the circumstances (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). It is impracticable to utilize the full-scale notice
and comment proceedings in section 553(b) because such proceedings would unjustifiably extend the rulemaking process,
and would further delay the implementation of the revised MAP. Congress clearly intended that EPA act expeditiously
to revise the MAP, and even established a deadline for the EPA revisions. EPA did not meet the deadline because of the
time-consuming process that was necessary to create an accreditation plan that would coordinate with existing,
diverse State accreditation programs, minimize disruption of current training providers, and contain other provisions
necessary to implement the revisions. If EPA were to develop and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant
to section 553(b), the revisions would have been even further delayed. The impact of such a delay would be exacerbated
by the additional time that is required for States to pass conforming legislation and implement the revised MAP after
it is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, full-scale rulemaking is unnecessary because EPA has communicated informally with affected parties,
given notice of the revisions to the public, and provided an opportunity to submit information and comments prior
to promulgating this interim final rule. Initially, the Agency consulted with affected organizations to identify
revisions that were necessitated by ASHARA. These organizations included schools, commercial building owners
and operators, asbestos abatement consultants and contractors, labor organizations, training providers, and
States. Subsequently, EPA published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that described the revisions that were being considered, and announced a public meeting to discuss the changes (57
FR 20438, May 13, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also established a docket containing information which supports EPA's revision of the MAP. To provide interested
persons the opportunity for oral presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning the changes under consideration,
EPA held a public meeting on June 8, 1992, in Washington, DC. Twenty-three persons presented oral comments for the
record. A transcript of this proceeding is contained in the docket. EPA also received 80 written comments in response
to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcement. These comments have also been filed in the docket, and were carefully considered by the Agency in revising
the MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The various new requirements of the MAP are described here in greater detail. This summary is organized by subject
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The promulgated revisions establish a new definitions section for the MAP. Seven terms are included to help clarify
and delineate the scope and applicability of the MAP to work performed in public and commercial buildings. The seven
terms, and their meanings, are summarized below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public and commercial building.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``public and commercial building'' is defined in TSCA section 202(10) to mean ``any building which is not
a school building, except that the term does not include any residential apartment building of fewer than 10 units''
(15 U.S.C. 2642(10)). This definition identifies those buildings where persons performing certain asbestos-related
work are subject to the MAP training and accreditation requirements. Such buildings generally include apartment
complexes, condominiums and cooperatives of more than 10 units, office buildings, government-owned buildings,
colleges, museums, airports, hospitals, churches, preschools, stores, warehouses, and factories. It also includes
all industrial buildings, because industrial buildings are included within the broad statutory definition of public
and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This particular term does not include elementary or secondary schools as defined in section 198 of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 2854; 15 U.S.C. 2642(9) and (12)). The definition in the revised MAP
excludes all detached single family homes, because they are residential buildings of fewer than 10 dwelling units.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, consistent with the statute and EPA's regulatory approach for schools, the term is interpreted to include
only the interiors of buildings except for exterior hallways connecting buildings, porticos, and mechanical systems
used to condition interior space. Consequently, accredited workers are generally not required for work on roofing
or siding materials that are on the outside of either public and commercial buildings or schools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Friable asbestos-containing material (ACM)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In TSCA section 202, friable asbestos-containing material means any material containing more than one percent
asbestos, which has been applied on ceilings, walls, structural members, piping, duct work, or any other part of a
building, which, when dry, may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure. The term includes non-friable
ACM after such previously non-friable material becomes damaged to the extent that when dry it may be crumbled, pulverized,
or reduced to powder by hand pressure'' (15 U.S.C. 2642(6)). At no point does the statute regulate activities that
involve nonbuilding materials, such as asbestos gloves or asbestos brake linings, that may be either stored or used
inside of a building. Consequently, the use of the term ``friable ACM'' in the MAP refers only to ``friable asbestos-containing
building material (ACBM),'' and, where the statute requires accreditation for activities associated with ACM,
accreditation is only required if the asbestos is part of the building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inspection
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Although AHERA required that schools conduct asbestos inspections, ASHARA did not extend this same requirement
to public and commercial buildings. Furthermore, because the Asbestos-Containing Materials in Schools Rule (``Schools
Rule'') (40 CFR 763.80&hyph;763.119) simply listed the various activities required to be included as a part of these
mandatory school inspections (40 CFR 763.85), without actually defining the term itself, a definition of ``inspection''
is necessary to delineate the scope of the MAP accreditation requirement as it applies to both schools and public and
commercial buildings. Accordingly, the term ``inspection'' is defined to mean those activities undertaken to specifically
determine the presence or location, or to assess the condition of, friable or non-friable ACBM or suspected ACBM,
whether by visual or physical examination, or by collecting samples of such material. Similarly, the term includes
all ``reinspections'' of friable and non-friable known or assumed ACBM which has been previously identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of a definition for the term inspection is intended to clarify when a person must obtain TSCA accreditation
before performing an inspection. TSCA Title II, as amended by ASHARA, did not define inspection. When Congress enacted
ASHARA, however, the Schools Rule was in effect, and it identified the activities that constituted an inspection
in school buildings (40 CFR 763.85 and 763.92). The definition of inspection adopted in the revised MAP is based upon
the core inspection activities identified in the Schools Rule at &sect;763.85(a), including the visual or physical
examination, and the sampling of ACBM or suspected ACBM to determine its location or presence or to assess its physical
condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the revised MAP, a person must be accredited to engage in any one of these core activities in a school or in
a public and commercial building. In addition, the Schools Rule continues to require accreditation for any person
who engages in any one of these core activities. Because the Schools Rule currently requires an accredited person
to conduct the core inspection activities, and the revised MAP requires accreditation for those same activities,
the revision will not expand the need for accredited inspectors in schools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition, however, also allows for three specific exceptions, dealing with related activities which do not
require accreditation. The three excepted activities include: periodic surveillance, compliance inspections,
and visual inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first exception under this term addresses periodic surveillance of the type described in 40 CFR 763.92(b), which
is commonly performed by custodial or maintenance workers. Periodic surveillance is distinct from reinspection
and is limited only to visual observations. It refers to a visual examination of an area in a building that previously
has been identified as containing ACBM, or that previously has been assumed to contain ACBM, and that is undertaken
to identify changes in the physical condition of that ACBM. Thus, a person would not need accreditation to visually
survey a ceiling that had already been identified in an earlier inspection or reinspection as suspected ACBM to determine
whether the ceiling had been damaged by a water leak. If the person assessed the condition of the ceiling by collecting
a sample, or touched it to determine whether it had become friable, however, then that person would have to be accredited
as an inspector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second type of activity that is excluded from the definition of inspection is compliance inspections performed
by Federal, State, or local regulatory agencies. These are excluded from accreditation because their primary purpose
is to determine adherence to applicable statutes or regulations, and not to locate, assess, or remedy the condition
of ACBM. TSCA Title II does not provide a clear definition of the types of inspection activities that require training.
The legislative history of ASHARA, however, indicates that Congress intended to require training only for those
persons who actually inspect for or abate asbestos in public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 136 Cong. Rec. S15304 (Oct. 15, 1990) (statement of Sen. Burdick). Based upon the purpose of ASHARA, EPA has concluded
that government personnel who inspect to determine compliance with laws regulating asbestos are not required to
obtain accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third exception involves visual inspections of the type referenced in 40 CFR 763.90(i). These types of activities
are excluded from the accreditation requirement because their purpose is to determine whether a response action
is complete, not to actually inspect for asbestos. See 136 Cong. Rec. S15304 (Oct. 15,1990) (statement of Sen. Burdick).
Moreover, when Congress enacted ASHARA, it was aware that AHERA required accreditation for persons who inspected
for asbestos in schools. Persons who conducted visual inspections in schools to determine whether a response action
was complete, however, did not have to be accredited as inspectors. The legislative history of ASHARA indicates that
Congress did not intend to expand the categories of persons that had to be accredited when it modified the accreditation
requirements to include public and commercial buildings as well as schools. As noted by Senator Chafee: ``[ASHARA]
does not require the accreditation of any category of individuals not now required to be accredited to perform asbestos
abatement work [under AHERA].'' 136 Cong. Rec. S15309 (Oct. 15, 1990) (statement of Sen. Chafee). Consequently,
EPA has concluded that a person who conducts an inspection in a public and commercial building to determine whether
a response action is complete does not have to be accredited as an inspector. Of course, many persons performing such
activities will otherwise need accreditation as asbestos abatement workers or contractor/supervisors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``response action'' is defined in the MAP to mean a method, including removal, encapsulation, enclosure,
repair, and operation and maintenance, that protects human health and the environment from friable ACBM. This definition
is consistent with the definition of ``response action'' in TSCA section 202(11) (15 U.S.C. 2642(11)), and with the
definition of ``response action'' in the Schools Rule found at 40 CFR 763.83. Its incorporation into the revised MAP
will therefore ensure that it applies equally to regulated activities in both schools and public and commercial buildings.
Consequently, those activities that are response actions in schools will also now be response actions when and where
they are undertaken in public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, a person planning or conducting a response action is subject to the MAP accreditation requirements only
if the ACBM is friable (15 U.S.C. 2646(a)(3)). As defined in both the MAP and in TSCA section 202(6), ``friable ACM''
refers only to ACM that ``when dry, may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure'' (15 U.S.C.
2642(6)). It also includes previously ``nonfriable material after such previously non-friable material becomes
damaged to the extent that when dry, it may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure'' (15 U.S.C.
2642(6)). This statutory definition of friability thereby limits the scope of the accreditation requirements for
response actions in both schools and public and commercial buildings to ACBM that is friable or expected to become
friable during the course of the response action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Small-scale, short-duration activities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of the revised MAP, ``small-scale, short duration activities (SSSD)'' are tasks such as, but not limited
to: (a) Removal of asbestos-containing insulation on pipes, (b) removal of small quantities of asbestos-containing
insulation on beams or above ceilings, (c) replacement of an asbestos-containing gasket on a valve, (d) installation
or removal of a small section of drywall, or (e) installation of electrical conduits through or proximate to asbestos-containing
materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSSD can be further defined by the following considerations: (a) Removal of small quantities of ACM only if required
in the performance of another maintenance activity not intended as asbestos abatement, (b) removal of asbestos-containing
thermal system insulation not to exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single glove bag, (c)
minor repairs to damaged thermal system insulation which do not require removal, (d) repairs to a piece of asbestos-containing
wallboard, or (e) repairs, involving encapsulation, enclosure, or removal, to small amounts of friable ACM only
if required in the performance of emergency or routine maintenance activity and not intended solely as asbestos abatement
(such work may not exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single prefabricated mini-enclosure.
Such an enclosure shall conform spatially and geometrically to the localized work area, in order to perform its intended
containment function). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition is intended to establish a common exemption threshold for both schools and public and commercial
buildings that limits the applicability of the MAP training and accreditation requirements. All persons in schools
or public and commercial buildings who perform SSSD that do not otherwise meet the criteria for a major fiber release
episode under 40 CFR 763.91(f)(2) are exempt from the MAP accreditation requirements. However, a SSSD removal of
more than 3 square or linear feet of friable ACBM, where this amount of friable ACBM either falls or is dislodged, requires
the use of an accredited worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Major and minor fiber release episodes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To help clarify the applicability and limits of the SSSD exemption under the MAP, EPA is incorporating two additional
definitions for the terms ``Minor Fiber Release Episode'' and ``Major Fiber Release Episode.'' Consistent with
the Schools Rule (40 CFR 763.83 and 763.91(e), (f)), a minor fiber release episode is ``any uncontrolled or unintentional
disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible emission'' that ``involves the falling or dislodging of 3 square or linear
feet or less of friable ACBM.'' A major fiber release episode is ``any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance
of ACBM, resulting in a visible emission'' that ``involves the falling or dislodging of more than 3 square or linear
feet of friable ACBM.'' The Schools Rule uses these terms, in addition to SSSD, as a means to distinguish between those
maintenance activities that require the use of accredited workers, and those that do not. These terms help delineate
when persons performing operation and maintenance activities are subject to MAP training and accreditation requirements.
Like SSSD, they are basic to determining the scope of the regulation, and have been added for that reason.

B. Phased Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided that it is necessary to phase-in the MAP revisions to achieve an orderly transition to the revised plan.
Additional time will be needed after the revised MAP has taken effect for States to adopt accreditation plans no less
stringent than the revised MAP, for training course providers to modify their training courses in keeping with upgraded
MAP standards, and for individuals to obtain new or additional training where applicable. For these reasons, the
revisions incorporate a timetable with two distinct deadlines; one that applies to States, and another for accredited
persons and training course providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
States.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA believes that it is reasonable to allow States a comparable amount of time to come into compliance with the revised
MAP as was allowed under the original MAP. Therefore, the requirement of the original MAP, that each State must adopt
an accreditation plan at least as stringent as the EPA model plan within 180 days after the commencement of the first
regular session of the State's legislature following EPA's adoption of the model plan, is carried over to the revised
MAP. When Congress originally enacted AHERA, it required States to adopt such a plan, and established a deadline that
was tied to the timing of the first legislative session following completion of the MAP. When it promulgated ASHARA,
Congress did not modify TSCA section 206(b)(2) that requires States to have a plan at least as stringent as the MAP (15
U.S.C. 2646(b)(2)). When Congress enacted ASHARA, it was aware that States would need time to enact conforming State
legislation. It is reasonable to conclude that Congress intended to allow States the same amount of time to adopt implementing
legislation to comply with the MAP revisions in ASHARA that it had originally allowed for compliance with AHERA. The
deadline for State revisions of accreditation plans allows States the time that is needed to revise State laws. When
this deadline is combined with the other provisions to phase-in the MAP revisions, EPA believes that there will be
an orderly transition to the expanded system of accreditation for schools, and public and commercial buildings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some States already will have contractor accreditation programs that meet or exceed the upgraded MAP requirements
when the revised MAP takes effect. These States are essentially unaffected by the revisions, and may continue to operate
as before. A second group of States will not have accreditation programs in place that are as stringent as the revised
MAP when it first takes effect, but will have preexisting accreditation programs that are in compliance with the original
MAP. These State programs may or may not be approved by EPA under the revised MAP. Until such a State revises its program
to comply with the upgraded MAP standards, it will not have the authority to approve any new training courses to provide
training or accreditation that satisfies the requirements of TSCA section 206(a) (15 U.S.C. 2646(a)). In the interim,
however, the State may continue to train persons and issue the accreditation required by TSCA section 206(a) if the
State program otherwise complies with the minimum standards of the original MAP. The State also may continue its approval
of training course providers, if the State issued the approval before the effective date of the revised MAP, and the
training provider is in compliance with the self-certification requirements contained in Unit V.B. of the revised
MAP. This allows qualified training course providers to continue to train and issue accreditation that satisfies
TSCA section 206(a) requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some States in the second group will revise their accreditation program to be at least as stringent as the MAP within
180 days after the commencement of the legislature's first regular session that is convened after the effective date
of the revised MAP. When such a State achieves this program upgrade, it will regain the authority to approve new training
course providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other States in the second group, however, may fail to meet the deadline for achieving the necessary program upgrade.
Beginning on their respective deadline dates, these States will no longer have the authority to train persons or issue
accreditation that satisfies the requirements of TSCA section 206(a), or to approve training course providers to
conduct TSCA training or issue TSCA accreditation. A training provider that had been approved by such a State automatically
loses its State approval. A training provider that loses State approval in this manner, however, will become EPA-approved
if the provider has self-certified and is otherwise in compliance with the revised MAP. Finally, such a State automatically
loses any EPA approval it may have had. Once lost, a State would need to reapply for such approval under the procedures
outlined in Unit II of the revised MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third group of States will not have any accreditation program in place when the revised MAP takes effect, or will not
have a program which is at least as stringent as the original or revised MAP. These States are not in compliance with
TSCA Title II, are not authorized to train persons or issue accreditation that satisfy the requirements of TSCA section
206(a), and may not approve training course providers to conduct TSCA training or issue TSCA accreditation. EPA strongly
recommends that States apply for and retain EPA approval of their accreditation programs for the purpose of substantiating
their compliance status under TSCA Title II. Substantiation of compliance benefits all affected persons and organizations,
including States that may be considering reciprocal arrangements with other States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training course providers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The revised MAP stipulates that all approved training course providers, whether approved by EPA or a State, must self-certify
that they have upgraded their approved training programs to comply with the requirements of the revised MAP within
6 months of the revised MAP taking effect. The certification must be received by EPA on or before October 4, 1994. This
requirement applies across-the-board to all initial and refresher training courses in all five accredited disciplines
even though actual curriculum modifications are only required for the initial worker, contractor/supervisor,
and project designer courses. Self-certification is required for all courses and all disciplines because all training
providers must certify that they not only comply with the prescribed training course curricula, but with the new recordkeeping
and certificate provisions of the revised MAP as well. The self-certification process is to be accomplished by submitting
a written assurance to EPA that courses and programs have been appropriately modified. The self-certification must
be signed by an authorized representative of the training provider, and must include the following statement: ``Under
civil and criminal penalties of law for the making or submission of false or fraudulent statements or representations
(18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15 U.S.C. 2615), I certify that the training described in this submission complies with all applicable
requirements of Title II of TSCA, 40 CFR part 763, Appendix C to Subpart E, as revised, and any other applicable Federal,
state, or local requirements.'' The self-certification submission must also include documentation adequately
describing the course and program modifications effected to achieve compliance with the revised MAP. Training providers
with multiple course approvals are encouraged to certify all such courses through a single consolidated submission.
Complete duplicate copies of self-certifications must also be sent to and received by any State approving offices
as of the same deadline date. Training courses that have not self-certified as of October 4, 1994, will no longer be
approved, and must reapply through a State Program which is no less stringent than the revised MAP to have their approval
status restored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was previously announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 38802, September 20, 1989), EPA stopped accepting new training course applications from providers for review
and contingent approval as of October 15, 1989. Since that date, all training courses without approval have had to
apply directly to State Programs with accreditation plans no less stringent than the original MAP in order to obtain
the necessary approval. Once a training course has been self-certified, a training provider may continue to offer
that training course pursuant to the revised MAP. If the course had initially been approved by an EPA-approved State,
and that State subsequently forfeits its EPA-approved status, EPA will continue to recognize the training course
as being an approved course if it has been self-certified and otherwise remains in compliance with the revised MAP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accredited persons.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The revisions grandfather all persons who possess valid accreditation as of the day before the date upon which the
revised MAP goes into effect. A person is considered to have valid accreditation if they are in possession of an accreditation
certificate that has not yet expired. If a State allows a person with an expired certificate to reinstate accreditation
by completing refresher training within the 12&hyph;month grace period, then such a person will also be considered
to have valid accreditation for purposes of grandfathering. The person must successfully complete the necessary
refresher training course within 12 months of the date their certificate expires. Persons who do not meet either of
the above conditions do not possess valid accreditation, and will not be grandfathered for purposes of accreditation
under the revised MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grandfathered persons will not have to repeat initial training in order to perform work subject to accreditation,
but will have to continue to fully comply with all annual refresher training requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who do not possess valid accreditation as of the day before the date upon which the revised MAP goes into effect
have two alternative means of obtaining initial accreditation. A person may take an upgraded training course, and
obtain accreditation that complies with the revised MAP. Alternatively, a person may take a course that was approved
under the original MAP and obtain provisional accreditation. However, this person must then also complete the upgraded
training course for the same discipline within 6-months of the revised MAP taking effect, on or before October 4, 1994,
in order to obtain accreditation that complies with the revised MAP and to continue working beyond that date. This
mechanism will ensure that all persons who become newly accredited after the revised MAP takes effect will meet the
upgraded training standards within 6 months, while at the same time, making it possible for all persons to acquire
a provisional accreditation and continue to work during the 6&hyph;month transition period when training providers
are upgrading their courses and programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From earlier consultations with training providers, EPA anticipates that many, if not most, will have little or no
difficulty transitioning to the upgraded training course standards (OPPTS Docket No. 62107, Log No. B2&hyph;002).
For worker and contractor/supervisor courses, this involves extending hands-on training from 6 to 14 hours. For
the project designer course, it involves revising instructional materials as necessary to accomodate curriculum
changes. For the inspector and management planner courses, there are no required curriculum changes per se. Because
many training providers already comply with the new recordkeeping and certificate requirements as a matter of standard
business practice, these adjustments are not expected to be burdensome. Development and submittal of the self-certification
letter, by design, should also be a relatively simple task. In addition, EPA expects that once the revised MAP has gone
into effect, demand for the upgraded training courses in favor of the original courses will provide sufficient market
incentive for a significant number of training providers to self-certify quickly, thereby expediting an infrastructure
shift from the old courses to the new. The examples below are intended to help illustrate how accreditation will operate
during the transition period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Person ``A'' obtains initial accreditation as a worker 1&hyph;month before the revised MAP takes effect. This
person is then grandfathered in when the revised MAP goes into effect 1&hyph;month later. The person must then complete
worker refresher training within 11 months after the revised MAP takes effect in order to continue accreditation
status unbroken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Person ``B'' is a non-accredited consultant who is awarded an asbestos abatement contract 4 months after the revised
MAP takes effect. This person is able to find and quickly complete an upgraded contractor/supervisor course, thereby
obtaining initial accreditation. This person has met the new training standards, and thus is unaffected by the 6&hyph;month
compliance deadline. The consultant must then satisfy the refresher training requirement within 1&hyph;year of
the initial accreditation date in order to continue uninterrupted contractor/supervisor work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Person ``C'' is a non-accredited consultant who is awarded a contract for project design 1-month after the effective
date of the revised MAP. This person is unable to find an upgraded training course, so opts to take the old initial project
designer training course and begin contract work without undue delay. This person may begin work, but must complete
an upgraded project designer course within the 6-month compliance deadline in order to continue working in an uninterrupted
manner. A consultant who does not complete the upgraded training course by the compliance deadline must then stop
work that requires TSCA accreditation until obtaining upgraded accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same transitional provisions apply to any person who seeks initial accreditation after the revised MAP takes
effect, including inspectors and management planners. The revised MAP imposes certain new requirements on all disciplines,
specifically new recordkeeping and certificate requirements. EPA has concluded that everyone who is initially
accredited after the revised MAP takes effect should be subject to the same transitional provisions to insure that
their training and accreditation will be adequately documented as required by the new rule, and that they will have
certificates that contain all the necessary information. Such uniformity will make the accreditation requirements
easier to comply with and enforce.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Distinct Training Disciplines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These MAP revisions reaffirm the principle that each of the five accredited training disciplines in the MAP is distinct
from the others. Because each discipline reflects a different functional job role, proficiency in any one of the five
disciplines requires a different mix of knowledge, skill, and ability. Even where training programs cover common
subjects, these same subjects need to be given a different priority and emphasis depending upon the particular discipline
a person is being trained for. To ensure that each discipline receives adequate training, the revisions have incorporated
the following changed requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each initial and refresher training course offered for accreditation must be specific to a single discipline,
and not combined with training for any other discipline. The past practice of training providers offering combined
worker and contractor/supervisor training is not allowed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Workers are no longer permitted to ``upgrade'' their worker accreditation to that of contractor/supervisor by
completing only one additional day of training. Separate initial training as a contractor/supervisor is now required.
Accredited contractor/supervisors, however, may perform as workers without obtaining separate accreditation
as such. This is because contractor/supervisors have received more training in the aggregate than workers to ensure
that they can perform their more complex job functions, and they must otherwise know how to perform all of the various
tasks which workers are normally called upon to perform. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Persons completing initial training for accreditation as contractor/supervisors are no longer permitted to
work as accredited project designers during their initial 1-year term of accreditation. This dual-accreditation
provision, found in section I.1.C. of the original MAP, has been deleted from the revised MAP. Persons seeking accreditation
as contractor/supervisors must now complete the new 5&hyph;day initial training for contractor/supervisors,
and persons seeking accreditation as project designers must now complete the new 3&hyph;day initial training for
project designers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Increased Training Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 15(a)(3) of ASHARA mandated that EPA, as a part of revising its MAP, increase the minimum number of training
hours, including additional hours of hands-on health and safety training, required for the accreditation of asbestos
abatement workers in schools and public and commercial buildings. EPA interprets the phrase ``asbestos abatement
workers'' to include both workers and contractor/supervisors. These groups have the greatest need for additional
hands-on training because they either actually perform asbestos abatement work, or directly oversee it at the job
site. The revised MAP therefore incorporates 1 additional 8&hyph;hour day of hands-on training for both the worker
and the contractor/supervisor disciplines. This has the effect of increasing the worker course from a total of 3 days
to 4 days of training, with the hands-on training component increased from 6 hours to 14 hours. Similarly, the 4&hyph;day
contractor/supervisor course has been upgraded to a 5&hyph;day course, with 14 hours of hands-on activity. These
training hour requirements not only fulfill the statutory mandate for additional hands-on training for asbestos
abatement workers, but also ensure that training can be obtained within the practical limits of a normal 40&hyph;hour,
5&hyph;day work-week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum training hour requirements for the other three accredited MAP disciplines, that of inspector, management
planner, and project designer have not been altered. Congress only mandated increased training for asbestos abatement
workers, and the only accredited disciplines directly engaged in hands-on abatement work are the worker and contractor/supervisor.
The project designer and management planner courses do not include any hands-on health and safety training component.
Because inspectors likewise do not participate in abatement, the existing 4-hour hands-on component for inspectors
is unaffected by the ASHARA mandate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Expanded Project Designer Curriculum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MAP revisions incorporate several additions to the mandatory curriculum for accredited project designer training,
but do not extend the required length of this initial training program. These changes relate only to the scope of training;
they do not require an accredited project designer to perform any particular work practices. Because of concerns
that project designs may sometimes be either inadequately prepared and/or executed, the curriculum additions are
aimed at both clarifying and improving the effectiveness of the project designer's functional role (see OPPTS Docket
No. 62107, Log No. C1&hyph;030). Where no written design plan exists, implementation can be prone to failure. This
may also occur where a project design has not adequately considered all relevant facets of an abatement project. For
these reasons, the six new topics which have been added include: (1) The need for and methods of preparing a written
project design, (2) techniques for completing an initial cleaning of the work area, (3) increased emphasis on the
rationale behind the establishment of functional spaces, (4) the need for written diagrams and methods of diagraming
all containment barriers, (5) the need for a written sampling rationale for air clearance, and (6) clarification
of what constitutes a complete visual inspection.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Deaccreditation of Persons and Withdrawal of Course Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MAP revisions establish minimum national criteria for suspending or revoking the accreditation of individuals
as well as for suspending or withdrawing the approval of training courses. Also included are additional criteria
that EPA may use, and States are free to adopt, as well as the procedures that EPA will follow when suspending, revoking,
or withdrawing accreditation or approval. The specified procedures are derived from those used for the suspension,
modification, or revocation of pesticide applicator certificates found at 40 CFR 171.11(f). EPA believes that these
procedures provide adequate notice and process to affected individuals and training course providers, while enabling
the Agency to act more quickly than through those procedures specified at 40 CFR part 22, which had also been considered
by the Agency. States, in initiating these kinds of actions, would be bound by the requirements of their own State administrative
procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The enumeration of criteria for suspension, revocation, or withdrawal is not meant to be a complete list of enforcement
actions and choices available to EPA. Since the MAP is a regulation promulgated under Title II of TSCA, persons violating
the MAP may also be subject to assessment of civil administrative penalties. The MAP revisions also clarify that EPA
may take independent actions against either training entities or accredited persons, without reliance upon State
enforcement authority or initiative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deaccrediting persons.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four minimum criteria are established for triggering deaccreditation actions by EPA or a State. They include: (1)
Performing work requiring accreditation at a job site without being in physical possession of initial and current
accreditation certificates; (2) permitting the duplication or use of one's own accreditation certificate by another;
(3) performing work for which accreditation has not been received; or (4) obtaining accreditation from a training
provider that does not have approval to offer training for the particular discipline from either EPA or from a State
that has a contractor accreditation plan at least as stringent as the EPA MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may also suspend or revoke a person's accreditation if such person has been found in violation of other asbestos
regulations administered by EPA. States may wish to adopt this criterion, or modify it to include their own asbestos
statutes or regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the revised MAP identifies some of the situations when a person who is performing an activity that requires
accreditation will be subject to civil penalties under TSCA. Examples include, but are not limited to: (1) Obtaining
accreditation through fraudulent representation of training or examination documents; (2) obtaining training
documentation through fraudulent means; (3) gaining admission to and completing refresher training through fraudulent
representation of initial or previous refresher training documentation; or (4) obtaining accreditation through
fraudulent representation of accreditation requirements such as education, training, professional registration,
or experience. This list is not exhaustive, and there may be other situations where persons may be subject to penalties
under TSCA by conducting work without the requisite accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Withdrawal of course approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This new provision requires that States have minimum criteria and procedures for suspending or withdrawing approval
from approved training courses. In pursuing actions for withdrawal of approval of accredited training programs,
States should follow their own State administrative procedures. EPA may directly pursue actions for withdrawal
of approval of accredited training programs without reliance on State withdrawal actions or enforcement authority
or actions. In taking such actions, EPA will use the same procedures specified for the suspension or revocation of
accreditation, those found at 40 CFR 171.11(f), to suspend or withdraw approval of a training course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA continues to have the ability to withdraw approval of accredited training programs if field site inspections
indicate that a training course is not conducting training that meets the requirements of the EPA MAP. Similarly,
the requirement that training course providers permit EPA representatives to attend, evaluate, and monitor any
training course without charge to EPA is preserved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that training providers should understand the criteria that the Agency will use to trigger a withdrawal
action. Minimum criteria which trigger the commencement of a withdrawal action for withdrawal of approval of accredited
training programs have been added to the MAP, including: (a) Misrepresentation of the extent of a training course's
approval by a State or EPA; (b) failure to submit required information or notifications in a timely manner; (c) failure
to maintain requisite records; (d) falsification of accreditation records, instructor qualifications, or other
accreditation information; or (e) failure to adhere to the training standards and requirements of the EPA or State
MAP as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may also suspend or withdraw a training course's approval if an approved training course instructor or other person
with supervisory authority over the delivery of training has been found in violation of other asbestos regulations
administered by EPA. An administrative or judicial finding of violation, or execution of a consent agreement and
order under 40 CFR 22.18, constitutes evidence of a failure to comply with relevant statutes and regulations. States
may wish to adopt this additional criterion, or modify it to include their own asbestos statutes or regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formal procedures for withdrawing course approval do not apply to training providers that fail to comply with
the self-certification requirements of the revised MAP and that do not upgrade their courses within 6 months of the
effective date of the revised MAP. EPA is provisionally allowing training providers to continue to operate during
that 6-month period pursuant to approval granted under the original MAP. A training provider that fails to comply
with the self-certification requirements within 6 months, however, automatically loses its provisional approval
by operation of law. No individual notices or adjudicative process is required to effect the loss of such provisional
approvals pursuant to this rule.

G. Recordkeeping Requirements for Training Providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised MAP imposes a variety of new recordkeeping requirements on training providers that are necessary to strengthen
compliance with MAP training standards and to enable more vigorous enforcement of those standards by both EPA and
the States. Four different types of records must be maintained: (1) Records documenting approved training course
materials (e.g., copies of student manuals, instructor notebooks, handouts), (2) records demonstrating instructor
qualifications (e.g., copies of resumes, approval letters, dates and names of courses taught), (3) records documenting
examinations (e.g., copies of tests used, individual student scores, dates and locations of exams given), and (4)
records documenting accreditation certificates (e.g., to whom conferred, for which disciplines, dates of issuance
and expiration). The revisions further stipulate that all such records must be retained for at least 3 years, and that
reasonable access to all such records must be provided upon request to either or both EPA and the States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Accreditation Certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised MAP stipulates that each accreditation certificate issued by an approved training provider must now
contain certain additional items of information which had not been specified in the original MAP. The new minimum
certificate standard is intended to enable quick identification of and contact with the training provider that issued
the certificate. The revised MAP specifically requires the inclusion of the issuing provider's name, address, and
telephone number. This mechanism makes it possible for training providers, regulatory agencies, and the general
public to verify the accreditation status of persons performing work subject to the MAP.

III. Responses to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the various MAP changes being considered by EPA were received from many affected interest groups, including
States, commercial buildings owners and managers, labor organizations, trade associations, asbestos contractors
and consultants, training entities, power companies, universities, and federal agencies other than EPA. These
written comments may be found in the docket supporting this action (OPPTS&hyph;62107). This Unit discusses EPA's
responses to the significant issues raised in the comments received.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public and commercial buildings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters urged EPA to incorporate the NESHAP (40 CFR part 61 - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air
Pollutants) definition of ``facility,'' so that greater consistency might be achieved between the various EPA asbestos
rules. Although EPA is sympathetic to promoting regulatory integration whenever feasible, the statutory language
of TSCA section 202(10) complicates this attempt. A regulated ``facility'' under the NESHAP includes residential
buildings of more than four units, whereas the TSCA definition of ``public and commercial building'' includes residential
apartment buildings of 10 or more units. Because EPA's mandate to issue and revise the MAP comes from TSCA, as amended
by ASHARA, the TSCA definition is controlling. EPA must use the TSCA definition, even though it is less inclusive than
NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters suggested that the definition of the term ``public and commercial building'' should include ACM
that is located both on the insides and the exteriors of buildings. EPA had earlier examined this same issue when it
promulgated the Schools Rule and the original MAP pursuant to AHERA. At that time, EPA concluded that when AHERA used
the phrase ``in a school building,'' it meant the interior of the building, not the exterior (52 FR 41835, October 30,
1987). EPA adopted that interpretation in the Schools Rule which was in effect when Congress amended AHERA by enacting
ASHARA. EPA believes that Congress intended the term ``in'' a public or commercial building to be given the same meaning
as ``in'' a school building in the Schools Rule. Consistent with the approach incorporated in the Schools Rule, training
is required for work in interior areas only, except for exterior hallways connecting buildings, porticos, and mechanical
systems used to condition interior space. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several power companies and other industrial/manufacturing concerns objected to the Agency's proposal to include
``industrial'' buildings within the scope of the rule. They argued that the public generally does not have access
to these buildings, is therefore not exposed, and that workers in these industrial buildings are already adequately
protected by the OSHA asbestos standards or the EPA Worker Protection Rule. The accreditation requirements of the
statute, however, clearly extend to activities in industrial buildings. TSCA section 202(10) defines ``public
and commercial buildings'' expansively to mean ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 building which is not a school building, except the term does not include any residential apartment building of fewer
than 10 units'' (15 U.S.C. 2642(10)) (emphasis added). The statutory definition includes all buildings with only
two express exclusions for school buildings and residential buildings. Industrial buildings clearly do not qualify
for either exemption. Thus, they fall within the category of any other type of building that is encompassed by the term
``public and commercial building.'' Moreover, when Congress enacted ASHARA, it relied, in part, upon EPA's assessment
of risk in public and commercial buildings, an assessment that included industrial buildings. EPA's 1988 Report
to Congress on Asbestos in Buildings specifically identified industrial buildings as one of the types of structures
included under the TSCA definition of ``public and commercial buildings'' (Report to Congress, page 2). Further,
the inclusion of industrial buildings in the category of buildings where training is required is consistent with
the purpose of ASHARA to protect workers as well as the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In extending the MAP training and accreditation requirements to public and commercial buildings under the ASHARA
mandate, EPA recognizes that the revised MAP will now apply to activities in buildings that may be subject to the specific
training requirements of other Federal asbestos regulations. This includes the competent person training requirements
under the OSHA Asbestos Standard (29 CFR 1926.58) and the EPA Worker Protection Rule (40 CFR 763.121), the on-site
representative training requirements under the asbestos NESHAP (40 CFR 61.145), and the training requirements
for designated persons and operations and maintenance personnel found in the Schools Rule (40 CFR 763.84&hyph; 763.92).
EPA wishes to clarify that a person subject to the accredited training requirements of the MAP will also remain subject
to the applicable training requirements of these other asbestos rules. Compliance with the MAP does not automatically
relieve a person of responsibilities under other asbestos rules.

Friable ACM.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters, citing the need for regulatory consistency between schools and public and commercial buildings,
urged the Agency to preserve the concept of friable ACM which had been applied in the Schools Rule. EPA agrees with this
approach because it is consistent with the statutory mandate and because consistency between the Schools Rule and
the MAP is desirable. Both rules must comply with the same TSCA section 202(6) definition of friable ACM. Thus, the
Agency has incorporated that definition into the MAP. This ties the definition to ACBM that is or may become friable.

 notice (57 FR 20438). This expansive approach would not only extend accreditation requirements to include general
environmental hazard assessments for insurance and real estate purposes, but also would specifically extend those
requirements to all of the inspection-type activities required by other asbestos rules such as the Schools Rule,
NESHAP, the EPA Worker Protection Rule and the OSHA Asbestos Standard. EPA believes that such an all encompassing
definition is not warranted based upon risk, and would therefore result in unnecessary costs (see OPPTS Docket No.
62107, Log Nos. C1&hyph;025, C1&hyph;035, C1&hyph;038). EPA has elected a more targeted approach which focuses
on both the object and the activity of inspecting for asbestos. The statute limits the accreditation requirement
to those persons who ``inspect for ACM in school buildings...or in a public or commercial building'' (15 USC 2646 (a)(1)).
EPA has adhered to this statutory language, and required accreditation only for those persons who inspect or reinspect
specifically for ACBM. This would include, however, an inspection undertaken pursuant to NESHAP (40 CFR 61.145(a))
in a school, or public and commercial building, where the building owner or operator is required to thoroughly inspect
the building for the presence of asbestos prior to commencing a demolition or renovation activity. Similarly, inspections
required by other regulations would also be subject to accreditation, if the inspection, as defined in the revised
MAP, included a component that was specific to ACBM, and was conducted within a school, or public and commercial building
subject to the revised MAP. This includes more general inspection-type activities (e.g., environmental assessments)
where asbestos is one of several potential hazards or materials that are being looked for or examined. Regardless
of what other activities a person may be undertaking, if the person is inspecting for ACBM in a school, public, or commercial
building, that person must be accredited to perform the asbestos inspection component of that activity. Conversely,
if a person is performing an environmental assessment or building inspection that does not include an asbestos inspection
component, that person does not require asbestos accreditation to perform that activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described earlier in Unit II.A.3. of this preamble, other specific exceptions to the inspection accreditation
requirement include; (1) persons performing periodic surveillance of the type described in 40 CFR 763.92(b), (2)
compliance-related inspections performed by employees or agents of Federal, State or local government, and (3)
visual inspections of the type described in 40 CFR 763.90(i) for purposes of determining the completion of a response
action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response action
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Commenters overwhelmingly supported a definition for response action that would treat this term the same way both
for schools and for public and commercial buildings. EPA agrees with this approach because it provides regulatory
consistency between the MAP and the Schools Rule. Because many of the same contractors will be performing abatement
work in both schools and public and commercial buildings, the use of the same standard for both will further promote
comprehension of and compliance with the new accreditation requirements. The definition in the revised MAP is therefore
the same as that which appears in the Schools Rule. Consequently, if a response action were undertaken in a school,
and the same activity was then undertaken in a public or commercial building, both activities would be considered
response actions, and both activities would be required to engage the services of accredited workers unless specifically
excluded under the exemption for small-scale, short-duration activities. It should be noted, however, that there
are other aspects relating to the conduct of response actions which may be different for schools than for public and
commercial buildings. One example would be the requirements found at 40 CFR 763.90 for air clearance at the completion
of a response action which are applicable to such activities in schools but not in public and commercial buildings.

Small-scale, short-duration activities (SSSD)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A majority of commenters supported the extension of the existing Schools Rule training exemption for SSSD work in
schools to public and commercial buildings (see 40 CFR 763, Appendix B to Subpart E). EPA agrees with the use of this
exemption in the revised MAP, because it both preserves regulatory consistency and promotes compliance with the
statute. Also, absent such a threshold exemption, a great many persons involved in operation and maintenance-type
activities in buildings would have to be specially trained, regardless of risk.

Major and minor fiber release episodes

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A common theme among those commenting on the prospective incorporation of an SSSD exemption into the MAP was that
this concept lacked clarity, and was therefore difficult to interpret and apply. EPA is responding to this concern
in two ways. First, by using the existing SSSD exemption from the Schools Rule, the MAP will apply the same accreditation
exemption to all buildings (schools and public and commercial buildings) and thereby minimize any potential confusion
among the regulated community. Secondly, by adding the definitions of major and minor fiber release episodes, the
Agency is seeking to provide the clearest possible meaning to this exemption while keeping it entirely within the
framework established by the Schools Rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several State commenters expressed concern that an allowance of 180 days following their next legislative session
would not provide them with sufficient time to upgrade their programs in keeping with the increased training requirements
of ASHARA. Although EPA acknowledges the difficulties inherent with transitioning established State programs,
the changes were mandated by Congress when it enacted ASHARA. Furthermore, the relatively short timeframes established
in ASHARA for EPA to implement these training mandates clearly communicated a desire and intent for prompt action.
For these reasons, EPA believes that it is reasonable to allow States a comparable amount of time to come into compliance
with the revised MAP as had been allowed for under the original MAP. This provides each State with an allowance of 180
days following the convening of their next regular legislative session to adopt a State accreditation plan that is
no less stringent than the revised MAP. For some States with legislatures that meet every year, this means they will
have a period of time not less than 6 months in which to implement these changes. For other States whose legislatures
meet every other year, it means these States might have as long as 30 months to effect the changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training course upgrades
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Most commenters supported the 6&hyph;month compliance deadline for training course upgrades which EPA had proposed.
They also supported self-certification on the part of training entities as an efficient and practical way of quickly
implementing the new standards. Other commenters, however, contended that the 6&hyph;month deadline was either
too short or too long, and expressed concerns about the ability of EPA and/or the States to properly audit these upgraded
training programs. EPA considers the course upgrades prescribed in the revised MAP to be fully achievable within
a 6-month timeframe. The revisions directly affect only 3 of the 5 basic courses, and none of the refresher courses.
The initial worker and contractor/supervisor training courses must each incorporate 1 additional day of hands-on
training and the initial project designer courses must expand their curriculum to incorporate the 6 additional items
specified in the revisions. The original training provider self-certifications under ASHARA will be submitted
directly to EPA's Headquarter's Office in Washington, DC., so that this data can be quickly compiled at the national
level and integrated with existing data bases. This simplified and centralized process expedites course upgrades
to ensure that the new training courses will be widely available within a short period of time. EPA and/or the States
may then follow-up with field audits of these training programs as resources permit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accredited persons
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Most commenters expressed support for the Agency's proposal to grandfather in all those persons who are in possession
of valid accreditation as of the day before the effective date of the revised MAP. Many also suggested that everyone
else should be allowed more than 6 months to obtain valid accreditation based upon the increased ASHARA training requirements.
In contrast, a few suggested that a transition period of less than 6 months would be sufficient. Because of the fairly
simple adjustments needed to upgrade training courses, and because EPA is providing an expedited procedure (through
self-certification) for purposes of obtaining course provider upgrade approval, the Agency considers the 6-month
deadline for obtaining new accreditation to be adequate. Persons who are already accredited on the date the revised
MAP takes effect are not directly impacted by it. Upon reaching their annual expiration date, they will take their
annual refresher training course, as before, and their accreditation will be extended for an additional year. Persons
seeking new accreditation on and after the effective date of the revised MAP, however, will need to complete either
an existing course that complies with the original MAP and thereby obtain provisional accreditation, or an upgraded
course that complies with the revised MAP to obtain regular accreditation. If a person takes an existing course, that
person will have to complete the upgraded training course within 6 months after the revised MAP takes effect in order
to sustain their accreditation and continue working. This provision helps ensure that anyone needing to obtain initial
accreditation during the period of transition between the original MAP and the revised MAP will have the opportunity
to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the MAP requirements for refresher training should also be increased along with
the basic requirements. This might be accomplished by either extending the length of mandatory refresher training,
or expanding its curriculum, or both. EPA does not agree with this position, however, and believes that actual work
experience is at least equivalent to requiring additional hands-on training as a basis for reaccreditation. At the
time of refresher training, most accredited persons should have already acquired on-the-job experience at least
equivalent to what this refresher hands-on training might otherwise provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Distinct Training Disciplines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While a majority of commenters agreed with the general principle of separate training courses, many also believed
that an exception should be made in the case of combined worker/supervisor training. These parties pointed to the
common elements in the prescribed training curricula for these two disciplines as the primary reason for allowing
joint training. In this view, workers and supervisors would attend the same course, with the contractor/supervisors
coming back for 1 additional day of training after the worker curriculum had been completed. Although EPA permitted
this accomodation for a period of time under the original MAP, the Agency has now decided that, in light of the Congressional
mandate to strengthen and improve asbestos-related training programs, contractor/supervisors may no longer obtain
accreditation by attending the same training course as workers with a 1 day add-on. Contractor/supervisors have
markedly different job functions and responsibilities than workers. While many training elements are common to
these two disciplines, each discipline requires presentation at a different degree of complexity and level of detail,
depending upon whether a person is in training to become a worker, or in training to become a supervisor. An on-site
foreman, unlike a worker, must know how each of the workers should perform his/her individual assigned tasks, and
must also comprehend the total job to be done. As a result, a contractor/supervisor requires more in-depth training
on each of the training elements than does a worker. By way of illustration, ``regulatory review'' is one curriculum
training element that is common to both the worker and the supervisor courses. Where a worker must have a general understanding
of the bounds established by asbestos regulations, the supervisor, as the on-site person responsible for regulatory
compliance, must have a much greater depth of knowledge regarding these rules and the methods of complying. If supervisors
attend the same training course as workers, and are provided the same lecture on ``regulatory review,'' not only is
it likely that the workers in this class will get more regulatory training than they need (and possibly less of something
else more relevant to their jobs), but more importantly, the supervisors will not get the right mix of subject matter
depth and breadth. EPA believes, therefore, that the best way to ensure that contractor/supervisors receive the
specialized training they need is to keep their training courses separate and distinct from those of workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes, however, that it is permissible to allow an accredited contractor/supervisor to perform in the role
of an accredited worker without possessing separate worker accreditation. Separate worker accreditation is unnecessary
because the contractor/supervisor must essentially know all that the worker knows and more, and the contractor/supervisor
has also completed more training than the worker (5 days as opposed to 4 days). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The situation is different, however, with respect to dual accreditation for contractor/supervisors and project
designers. Because these two training disciplines share little in common, EPA is now eliminating the original MAP
provision whereby persons completing contractor/supervisor initial training could obtain dual accreditation
to work as both contractor/supervisors and project designers. After the effective date of the revisions, all persons
must take separate initial and refresher training that is specific to their discipline in order to obtain or retain
valid accreditation.

D. Increased Training Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA had solicited public comment on the number of additional hours of training that would be appropriate for the revised
MAP because ASHARA had left this amount unspecified. Whereas commenters suggested a variety of ways in which this
might be accomplished, many expressed support for EPA's proposal to require one additional 8&hyph;hour day of hands-on
training for the worker and the contractor/supervisor initial training courses respectively. The length of all
other training courses is not affected by the revisions. There are a number of distinct advantages to EPA's approach:
(1) All MAP training courses would be limited in length to no more than one 5&hyph;day business week, a period of time
adequate to accomplish the requisite training, (2) existing training course materials would remain relevant and
not require extensive modifications, (3) additional hands-on training should appropriately be given to those persons
who actually perform hands-on abatement work (i.e., workers and contractor/supervisors), and (4) the addition
of 8 hours of hands-on training (on top of 6 hours that are already required) should be relatively simple for providers
to achieve, yet affords them a degree of flexibility in deciding how to go about doing it (i.e., in selecting the particular
hands-on activities to be practiced or exercised). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters with experience in training, representing, or employing asbestos workers agreed that 8 additional
hours of hands-on training for workers and contractor/supervisors was advisable. They noted that the additional
day of training was necessary to allow workers to practice their jobs under actual working conditions, to gain necessary
experience in performing tasks such as erecting and dismantling containment barriers, glovebagging, and scaffolding,
and in working inside containment areas, or while wearing personal protective equipment, or in other common workplace
situations (see OPPTS Docket No. 62107, Log Nos. C1&hyph;016 and C1&hyph;020). Commenters also noted that the additional
day of hands-on training would help acclimatize workers without risk of exposure, and also would eliminate complaints
regarding the need for on-the-job training (OPPTS Docket 62107, Log Nos. C1&hyph;020 and C1&hyph;064).

E. Expanded Project Designer Curriculum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A majority of commenters agreed with EPA's proposal to broaden the prescribed project designer training curriculum
to include six additional lecture elements without extending the minimum required length of the course. The six elements
have therefore been added, and include: (1) The need for, and methods of preparing a written project design, (2) techniques
for completing an initial cleaning of the work area, (3) increased emphasis on the rationale behind establishment
of functional spaces, (4) the need for written diagrams and methods of diagraming all containment barriers, (5) the
need for a written sampling rationale for air clearance, and (6) clarification of what constitutes a complete visual
inspection. These revisions have each been incorporated as additions to the initial project designer training curriculum.
They will improve the effectiveness of the accredited training programs, and thereby help to ensure that project
designers will be fully prepared to perform work in both schools and public and commercial buildings.

F. Withdrawal of Accreditation and Course Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Broad support also was expressed for EPA's proposal to incorporate minimum Federal criteria for proceedings relating
to the deaccreditation of persons and the withdrawal of approval from accredited training courses, and to adopt standardized
procedures for such actions. These changes had been proposed to: (1) Promote greater consistency and predictability
nationwide, and (2) clarify the manner by which EPA might directly deaccredit individuals or training courses without
reliance upon State authority or activity. The criteria have therefore been promulgated as minimum Federal criteria
which the States must match or exceed in their own programs. The procedures govern EPA activities only; the States
being left free to adhere to their own internal administrative procedures pursuant to State law.

G. Recordkeeping Requirements for Training Providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that a records retention period longer than 3 years would be preferable for compliance
verification purposes. EPA, however, consistent with other TSCA recordkeeping requirements (i.e., 40 CFR 704.11
and 761.180), regards a minimum 3&hyph;year retention period as adequate for this purpose, and appropriate when
consideration is given to the costs associated with records maintenance. These 3 years are adequate to ensure that
records will be available for anyone who needs to verify either initial or refesher accreditation status. Even if
a person obtained initial accreditation, and then took advantage of a full 12&hyph;month grace period before obtaining
refresher training, the 3&hyph;year retention requirement would ensure that the training provider has the records
to verify the initial accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of training providers also expressed concerns about access; surmising that if their records were opened
in an unrestricted manner to the public, that such providers would become vulnerable to burdensome or harrassing
requests. They did not object, however, to training provider records being open to EPA and the States (see OPPTS Docket
No. 62107, Log No. D1-001). EPA accepts this position, and it has been incorporated into the revisions (see Unit I.F.6.
of the revised MAP). This would not preclude the public from seeking information directly from the training provider
through telephone inquiries or requests, but would permit training schools to maintain a measure of flexibility
in responding to inquiries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also had asked for comments about whether training providers should be required to verify the accreditation status
of students enrolling in their courses. In reply, several training entities commented that this could present a significant
burden that should not be imposed (OPPTS Docket 62107, Log Nos. C1-019 and C1-041). After considering this information,
EPA agrees, and the revised MAP includes a recommendation rather than a requirement that training entities verify
the accreditation status of students enrolling in their courses. Regarding the more general question of whether
or not recordkeeping requirements should be imposed, many commenters acknowledged the need for this action and expressed
support for EPA's position.

H. Accreditation Certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While most commenters expressed support for EPA's proposal to require additional training provider information
on accreditation certificates (i.e., issuer's name, address, and telephone number), a few suggested that other
items might be required as well, including the name of the course instructor and the photograph, social security number,
and signature of the person to whom accreditation is being conferred. The Agency does not consider these other items
to be necessary on certificates, because the same information is generally available through other sources. The
names of course instructors are otherwise provided through the recordkeeping requirements contained in the revisions,
and personal identification items such as photographs, social security numbers, and signatures are commonly available
on the professional licenses issued by State programs.

Project monitor training and accreditation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several parties indicated that EPA should expand the MAP to include mandatory accreditation for a sixth training
discipline, that of ``Project Monitor.'' The functional role of a project monitor is often specific to a particular
response action; but generally might include: (1) Monitoring a response action for compliance with contract/job
specifications and regulatory requirements, (2) performing visual audits of a job site before, during and after
a response action is undertaken, and (3) performing air monitoring as a part of a response action or for purposes of
clearing a response action. Depending upon the particular mix of activities undertaken by the project monitor, this
person might otherwise require accreditation, particularly if they somehow become directly involved in conducting
any part of the response action. Typically, however, the project monitor is an agent or employee representing a building
owner or manager who is engaged to oversee a contractor's performance of a response action in a school or public or commercial
building. These commenters argue that because such persons are already widely used, steps should be taken to ensure
a minimum level of competency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHARA did not grant the Agency a clear mandate to enlarge the scope of federal accreditation to include additional
training disciplines. Furthermore, implementing this course would necessitate more extensive changes to State
programs and statutes, a consequence which would hinder State efforts to comply with ASHARA. For these reasons, EPA
has incorporated a recommended training curriculum for such persons into the revised MAP and is urging States to consider
adopting this curriculum for purposes of requiring project monitor accreditation under State law or regulation.
Such State laws would not mandate that project monitors be used in every instance, but rather, would require their
accreditation whenever a building owner or manager elected to employ the services of a project monitor. This curriculum
was developed in 1992 through a roundtable discussion which involved numerous affected interests outside of EPA.
The document which emerged from this process, entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whitepaper on the Development and Implementation of Asbestos Abatement Project Monitor Training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (March 20, 1992), outlined a recommended 5&hyph;day training program. Even where States choose not to require accreditation
under their State Plans for such persons, EPA recommends that training entities consider offering this course, and
suggests that professionals working in this capacity seek out and obtain this or equivalent training.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Operations and maintenance training and accreditation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A few commenters suggested that persons responsible for SSSD operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) activity involving
ACBM should be subject to MAP training and accreditation requirements. They noted that while &sect;763.92(a) of
the Schools Rule requires school maintenance personnel to take special ``awareness'' training, and, in some instances,
additional O&amp;M training, the MAP would not require training for all maintenance personnel in public and commercial
buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This difference in training requirements is based upon the statutory training scheme that Congress established
in Title II of TSCA. Both the language of the statute, and the legislative history of AHERA and ASHARA support EPA's
decision not to require MAP accreditation for all O&amp;M personnel in public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When Congress enacted AHERA in 1986, it required MAP training and accreditation for persons who conducted response
actions, but excluded certain types of O&amp;M activities from the MAP training requirement (15 U.S.C. 2643(f),
2644(c), and 2646(a)(3)). It also required EPA to promulgate rules to regulate O&amp;M programs in schools, and required
local education agencies to develop and implement O&amp;M plans, and to provide for the education of service and maintenance
personnel with respect to asbestos-containing material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA promulgated the Schools Rule pursuant to AHERA. The Schools Rule does not require full MAP training and accreditation
for all O&amp;M workers, but does require it for any person in a school who: (a) Conducts a response action other than
a SSSD activity (40 CFR 763.90(g)); (b) performs a maintenance activity that disturbs friable ACBM, other than a SSSD
activity (40 CFR 763.91(e)); or (c) conducts a response action for a major fiber release episode (40 CFR 763.91(f)(2)(iii)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Schools Rule requires less extensive training for O&amp;M school employees that are not performing
an activity that falls within one of the three categories (40 CFR 763.92(a)). This last category of O&amp;M employee
does not have to be accredited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, in 1988, Congress amended AHERA, and created a new provision of TSCA, section 215, specifically to
codify the O&amp;M training requirements of the Schools Rule (15 U.S.C. 2655). Now, TSCA section 215 requires ``proper
training'' for school employees who conduct O&amp;M activities in a school (15 U.S.C. 2655(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, Congress further modified TSCA asbestos training requirements when it enacted ASHARA. Congress expanded
the MAP training requirements to cover persons working in public and commercial buildings, but it did not require
MAP training and accreditation for all persons who perform O&amp;M activities in such buildings. First, Congress
left intact the original language in TSCA section 206(a) that exempts many persons who conduct O&amp;M response actions
from MAP training and accreditation requirements in both schools and public and commercial buildings (15 U.S.C.
2646(a)(3)). In the second place, Congress chose not to expand the coverage of TSCA section 215 and require limited
training for O&amp;M employees in public and commercial buildings. Finally, unlike the original AHERA that governs
schools, Congress did not require EPA to promulgate rules regulating O&amp;M programs in public and commercial buildings,
nor did it require employers in such buildings to provide for the education of service and maintenance personnel with
respect to asbestos-containing material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with these Congressional actions, EPA has not required MAP training and accreditation for every O&amp;M
worker in public and commercial buildings. Rather, the revised MAP requires MAP accreditation where O&amp;M workers
are most at risk. O&amp;M personnel must obtain MAP accreditation when conducting a response action, including a
maintenance activity that disturbs friable ACBM, unless that activity is a SSSD activity, or when conducting a response
action for a major fiber release.

Management plans for public and commercial buildings

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A few commenters, noting that ASHARA section 15(a) specifically omitted management planners from the accredited
disciplines being extended to public and commercial buildings, suggested that management plans should otherwise
be required for such buildings. Although EPA, consistent with its manage-in-place policy articulated in the ``Green
Book'' guidance (see

Managing Asbestos In Place: A Building Owner's Guide to Operations and Maintenance Programs for Asbestos-Containing
Materials
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA No. 20T&hyph;2003, July 1990), considers management plans to be helpful tools in preventing asbestos exposures,
the Agency is not requiring management plans for regulated buildings in this revision. ASHARA did authorize EPA to
establish training standards for asbestos workers, but it did not authorize the Agency to require public and commercial
building owners to conduct asbestos-related work in a particular fashion. However, for those regulated public and
commercial buildings where asbestos-related problems are identified through inspections, EPA strongly recommends
that plans be prepared for how to address these issues. EPA's Green Book should prove to be a useful reference in this
respect. The Agency would also suggest that accredited management planners be engaged for purposes of developing
such plans to ensure their adequacy.

. Several commenters expressed concerns about the prospective quality of analytical work to be performed with respect
to public and commercial buildings, noting that EPA's announcement of additions and changes under consideration
had not mentioned the use of accredited laboratories for the analysis of bulk and/or air samples taken from such buildings.
TSCA section 206(d) provides for the establishment of the National Institute of Standards and Technology National
Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), and stipulates that only laboratories accredited under this
program will be allowed to conduct analyses of asbestos bulk and air samples taken from school buildings under the
authority of local education agencies (15 U.S.C. 2646(d)). But Congress did not extend this same requirement to the
analysis of bulk or air samples taken from regulated public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA strongly recommends that these samples be analyzed by NVLAP-accredited laboratories because these laboratories
have undergone Federal evaluation and testing and have met stringent performance standards. Further, EPA urges
that asbestos abatement site air be analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) prior to building reoccupancy
in a manner consistent with 40 CFR 763.90 (i)(3) and (4). This position is in keeping with EPA's on-going activity in
schools where the allowance for the use of phase contrast microscopy (PCM) has been greatly diminished. EPA strongly
recommends that abatement site air clearance samples collected from public and commercial buildings be analyzed
by TEM at NVLAP-accredited laboratories. EPA now considers the technically superior TEM analysis to be both economical
and widely available. TEM is technically superior to PCM because it is capable of measuring all asbestos fibers including
those thin fibers not measured by PCM; therefore, TEM is the more stringent analytical tool to be used for analysis
of airborne asbestos during abatement site air clearance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Instructor qualifications
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Some commenters were of the opinion that EPA had not gone far enough in establishing minimum qualifications for training
course instructors. The original MAP stipulated that instructors needed to have academic training or field experience
in asbestos abatement, yet allowed State programs to adopt their own more stringent qualification standards. Since
promulgation of the original MAP, many States have elected to institute their own instructor qualification requirements,
a fact which would now complicate any Federal effort to retroactively establish new minimum standards. EPA considers
this to be an issue best left to the States to decide. So long as course instructors demonstrate relevant training and
experience, and the knowledge and ability to provide effective instruction in the prescribed curriculum, EPA will
continue to view such persons as meeting minimum standards. States are encouraged, however, to review this issue
as they upgrade their programs in keeping with ASHARA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A related issue had also been raised independently by the General Accounting Office (GAO) in a May 1991, Report to Congress
entitled ``EPA's Asbestos Accreditation Program Requirements Need Strengthening.'' In this report, GAO had recommended
that EPA assess, in conjunction with its MAP revision, the need for requiring individuals working in the asbestos
professions to meet prequalification and experience standards. Although EPA responded to this comment by reevaluating
this issue and discussing it with affected organizations, the fact that at least 17 States had already adopted widely
varying prequalification standards posed a potentially significant obstacle (Source: State Asbestos Programs
Related to AHERA; A Survey of State Laws and Regulations. National Conference of State Legislatures. September,
1992) (OPPTS Docket No. 62107, Log No. B1&hyph;024). These States had established their own prequalification standards
for asbestos control professionals in response to EPA's earlier recommendation (contained in the original MAP)
that they should consider doing so. Consequently, any action by EPA to retroactively impose new Federal minimum standards
would add to the cost and difficulty of transitioning these State Programs into compliance with the revised MAP. Such
an outcome would not be helpful in promoting ASHARA's objective to achieve a decentralized program administered
by the 50 States. For this reason, EPA decided not to require new minimum prequalification standards in the revised
MAP. Nonetheless, in support of this goal, EPA has increased its experience requirements through incorporation
of an additional day of hands-on training in both the initial worker and contractor/supervisor training programs,
and is renewing/continuing its recommendation that States adopt other appropriate prequalification standards
of their own.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Foreign language courses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters suggested the need for specific requirements or accomodations for foreign language courses,
citing the significant numbers of non-English speaking persons who are now seeking accredited training. EPA policy
permits approved worker training courses in languages other than English so long as the course instruction, all of
the course materials, and the course examination are each presented in the same foreign language. Given the lack of
a uniform distribution of non-English speaking persons nationwide, with different languages prevailing in different
regions of the country, the MAP will continue to allow States to adopt their own standards and procedures in this regard
to address their individual and unique circumstances. EPA does, however, urge States to address these issues, and
to accomodate the needs of their respective non-English speaking populations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard forms
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Some commenters remarked that the use of standardized forms for purposes of inspection reports and management plans
would not only contribute to greater consistency and professionalism among accredited persons working with these
tools, but might also facilitate the development of reciprocal arrangements between State programs. EPA agrees
with these comments, and has incorporated specific recommendations into the training curricula for both inspectors
and management planners which are aimed at promoting greater usage of standardized forms. EPA recommends that States
consider the utility of adopting requirements for the use of standardized forms as an integral part of their asbestos
regulatory programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal recognition of State programs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several State commenters indicated that it is beneficial for a State to formally apply for and obtain Federal recognition
of its accreditation plan. TSCA Title II specifically requires States to adopt accreditation plans that are no less
stringent than the MAP, but does not require them to obtain formal EPA approval. Even though EPA approval is not statutorily
required, it is beneficial. Where a State adopts and implements an accreditation program but does not obtain EPA approval,
it is difficult for the industry and other States to determine whether such a State program complies with minimum Federal
requirements and thus has the authority to issue TSCA accreditation. Where a person obtains a license from an unrecognized
State, that person's credentials may not be readily accepted by an employer, a contractor, or another State in which
the person might seek to find work, because absent EPA's approval, there is uncertainty about whether such a person
is properly accredited. In contrast, EPA's approval of a State effectively resolves all of this uncertainty. EPA
agrees with these comments, and strongly recommends that all States seek formal EPA approval of their accreditation
programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Grace period for accreditation reinstatement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Other comments were received regarding whether there should be a ``grace period'' during which a person can complete
refresher training within 12 months of their certificate expiration date and have their accreditation reinstated.
Such a person would not be required to retake the full initial training program for that discipline. Some States expressed
support for this approach, while one suggested there should be a penalty for persons who fail to obtain their refresher
training on-time (i.e., before the certificate expiration date). EPA believes that the 12&hyph;month grace period
is appropriate. If a person takes their refresher training too early in their accreditation year, they are penalized
through a shortening of what would otherwise be a 12&hyph;month period. If they are unable to enroll in a refresher
course precisely when they need it, at a location which is convenient, the grace period allows them the opportunity
to take the course at a later, more convenient time. During the 12&hyph;month grace period, however, it should be emphasized
that the person is not accredited, and may not otherwise perform the work that requires accreditation until they complete
their refresher training. EPA views this as being a sufficient penalty for not obtaining the required refresher training
in a timely manner. Because the 12&hyph;month grace period has proven helpful to the industry, and effective in preserving
a sizeable, accredited workforce nationwide, the Agency plans to not only continue this procedure, but also to encourage
States to adopt it for their programs as well. Consequently, the revised MAP now contains a formal recommendation
that State programs take this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accreditation program adoption by the U.S. Department of Defense
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In commenting on EPA's proposed changes to the MAP, the Department of the Navy noted that it operates its own in-house
asbestos training program which it believes complies with the accreditation requirements of the MAP. For this reason,
the Navy suggested that EPA might formally review and approve the Navy's training program so that Defense Department
employees could become accredited through the Defense program, and therefore not need separate accreditation from
a State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHARA requires accreditation for all persons who perform certain types of asbestos-related work in public and commercial
buildings, and defines that type of building very broadly. As a result, EPA has concluded that Federal employees who
perform inspections or design or conduct response actions in government buildings must be accredited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 203(l) of TSCA, the Secretary of Defense is authorized to act in lieu of a State Governor with respect
to any school operated under the Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978 (20 U.S.C. 921 et seq.). This authority
allows the Secretary of Defense the opportunity to adopt its own accreditation program no less stringent than the
EPA MAP for the purpose of accrediting Defense Department employees performing asbestos-related work in these schools.
Although this might be accomplished in cooperation with EPA, the statute does not make the validity of the Defense
Department's plan for schools contingent upon EPA approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHARA, however, did not extend this accreditation authority given to the Secretary of Defense to cover Defense Department
employees performing asbestos-related work in public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the Navy's in-house training courses, the Navy may apply for approval of its training courses in the
same manner as any other training provider. This would permit the Navy to accredit any of its employees who might complete
these approved training courses. However, because EPA is no longer accepting new courses for review and contingent
approval (see 54 FR 38802), only those States with accreditation programs no less stringent than the MAP are in a position
to grant approval for such courses.

IV. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulatory impact analysis estimates the costs and benefits attributable to this regulation. Because this regulation
is an amendment to a current regulation, the costs and benefits are incremental, estimating the additional effect
of the regulation with respect to the current regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with this regulation are quantified; the benefits are discussed in qualitative terms and are
expected to be of significant importance. EPA believes this rule achieves the benefits mandated by Congress at a modest
cost. The rule affects training providers, asbestos workers, asbestos abatement and inspection companies, building
owners, general building workers and occupants, State governments, and the Federal government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefits associated with this rule involve reductions in exposure to asbestos fibers due to the use of knowledgeable
individuals to work with asbestos and the use of safer work practices. The increased training requirements are expected
to increase the knowledge of the trained individuals. The population most affected by this regulation is the asbestos
professionals engaged in inspections and abatements, of which there are about 200,000 individuals who are required
to be trained under this regulation for work in public and commercial buildings. These individuals are expected to
benefit the most from this regulation due to the amount of time spent working with ACBM. EPA estimates that there are
0.4 to 1.2 million public and commercial buildings with ACBM, in which there are between 14 and 43 million employees
and workers who will gain a greater degree of protection either through the use of trained contractors or their own
education. Other employees and building occupants will gain a greater degree of protection through the use of appropriate
and correctly applied work practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with this rule are well documented. Upgrading courses, retaining records, and allowing access
to records increase costs for training providers. Most of these costs are passed through in the form of higher charges
for the courses that are offered. In the first year, EPA estimates that the overall increase in course costs would be
between $2.3 million and $14.2 million. Training provider burden for recordkeeping and allowing access to their
records would be $200,000 to $250,000 for the first year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training providers estimate that 70 percent of the asbestos-related abatement work done in public and commercial
buildings already uses trained individuals. An analysis of the supply and demand of accredited asbestos professionals
in each of the four disciplines extended to public and commercial buildings illustrates that the national supply
is sufficient to accommodate the anticipated demand. Early estimates of supply and demand for project designers
suggested a potential for shortfall, and this conclusion provided a basis for delaying implementation of this rule
(57 FR 1913, January 16, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule requires the owners of public and commercial buildings to utilize accredited workers to inspect for ACBM,
and to design and carry-out response actions with respect to friable ACBM, unless exempted under the SSSD threshold.
EPA believes that most building owners will elect to hire outside contractors rather than train their own people to
comply with this requirement, resulting in an annual cost of $2 million to $45 million for the estimated 374,000 to
1.23 million buildings which will be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both State and Federal governments incur costs due to this rule. For the first year, State governments incur a cost
of just under $4 million, while EPA incurs a cost of between $70,000 and $130,000. These costs are due to updating and
reviewing State programs and reapproving training courses. Overall costs for the first year for this rule are estimated
to be between $8 million and $64 million. These costs are summarized below. Discounting over a 20&hyph;year period
at 7 percent yields a present value cost estimate between $33 million and $458 million.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f),
the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) Having an annual
effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities
(also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering
with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal
or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Administrator certifies that this revised rule
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. Virtually all of the States already
have some type of asbestos certification program now in effect. Nationwide, many thousands of persons are presently
completing accredited training programs each year. A discussion of EPA's analysis of the economic consequences
of this interim final rule appears in Unit IV. of this notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing such approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This collection of information requires training providers and States to respond. For training providers, public
reporting for this collection of information is estimated to average 42 hours per response. This includes the time
for reviewing the regulation, making required changes to training programs, preparing and submitting a self-certification
package, maintaining records, and providing access to those records. There is no recordkeeping burden associated
with maintaining the records as their maintenance is usual and customary business practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For States, public reporting for this collection of information is estimated to average 402 hours per response. This
includes the time for reviewing the regulation, comparing the new requirements with the current State program, completing
any necessary regulatory or legislative analysis, adopting new legislation or regulations, preparing and submitting
an application for program approval, and implementing an updated State program. For States, there is no recordkeeping
burden associated with this collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of Appendix C: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. ``Friable asbestos-containing material (ACM)'' means any material containing more than one percent asbestos
which has been applied on ceilings, walls, structural members, piping, duct work, or any other part of a building,
which when dry, may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure. The term includes non-friable
asbestos-containing material after such previously non-friable material becomes damaged to the extent that when
dry it may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. ``Friable asbestos-containing building material (ACBM)'' means any friable ACM that is in or on interior structural
members or other parts of a school or public and commercial building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. ``Inspection'' means an activity undertaken in a school building, or a public and commercial building, to determine
the presence or location, or to assess the condition of, friable or non-friable asbestos-containing building material
(ACBM) or suspected ACBM, whether by visual or physical examination, or by collecting samples of such material. This
term includes reinspections of friable and non-friable known or assumed ACBM which has been previously identified.
The term does not include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Periodic surveillance of the type described in 40 CFR 763.92(b) solely for the purpose of recording or reporting
a change in the condition of known or assumed ACBM; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Inspections performed by employees or agents of Federal, State, or local government solely for the purpose of determining
compliance with applicable statutes or regulations; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. visual inspections of the type described in 40 CFR 763.90(i) solely for the purpose of determining completion of
response actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. ``Major fiber release episode'' means any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible
emission, which involves the falling or dislodging of more than 3 square or linear feet of friable ACBM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. ``Minor fiber release episode'' means any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible
emission, which involves the falling or dislodging of 3 square or linear feet or less of friable ACBM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. ``Public and commercial building'' means the interior space of any building which is not a school building, except
that the term does not include any residential apartment building of fewer than 10 units or detached single-family
homes. The term includes, but is not limited to: industrial and office buildings, residential apartment buildings
and condominiums of 10 or more dwelling units, government-owned buildings, colleges, museums, airports, hospitals,
churches, preschools, stores, warehouses and factories. Interior space includes exterior hallways connecting
buildings, porticos, and mechanical systems used to condition interior space. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. ``Response action'' means a method, including removal, encapsulation, enclosure, repair, and operation and
maintenance, that protects human health and the environment from friable ACBM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. ``Small-scale, short-duration activities (SSSD)'' are tasks such as, but not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Removal of asbestos-containing insulation on pipes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Removal of small quantities of asbestos-containing insulation on beams or above ceilings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Replacement of an asbestos-containing gasket on a valve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Installation or removal of a small section of drywall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Installation of electrical conduits through or proximate to asbestos-containing materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSSD can be further defined by the following considerations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Removal of small quantities of ACM only if required in the performance of another maintenance activity not intended
as asbestos abatement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Removal of asbestos-containing thermal system insulation not to exceed amounts greater than those which can be
contained in a single glove bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Minor repairs to damaged thermal system insulation which do not require removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Repairs to a piece of asbestos-containing wallboard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Repairs, involving encapsulation, enclosure, or removal, to small amounts of friable ACM only if required in the
performance of emergency or routine maintenance activity and not intended solely as asbestos abatement. Such work
may not exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single prefabricated mini-enclosure. Such an
enclosure shall conform spatially and geometrically to the localized work area, in order to perform its intended
containment function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Initial Training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Training requirements for purposes of accreditation are specified both in terms of required subjects of instruction
and in terms of length of training. Each initial training course has a prescribed curriculum and number of days of training.
One day of training equals 8 hours, including breaks and lunch. Course instruction must be provided by EPA or State-approved
instructors. EPA or State instructor approval shall be based upon a review of the instructor's academic credentials
and/or field experience in asbestos abatement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beyond the initial training requirements, individual States may wish to consider requiring additional days of training
for purposes of supplementing hands-on activities or for reviewing relevant state regulations. States also may
wish to consider the relative merits of a worker apprenticeship program. Further, they might consider more stringent
minimum qualification standards for the approval of training instructors. EPA recommends that the enrollment in
any given course be limited to 25 students so that adequate opportunities exist for individual hands-on experience.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States have the option to provide initial training directly or approve other entities to offer training. The following
requirements are for the initial training of persons required to have accreditation under TSCA Title II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training requirements for each of the five accredited disciplines are outlined below. Persons in each discipline
perform a different job function and distinct role. Inspectors identify and assess the condition of ACBM, or suspect
ACBM. Management planners use data gathered by inspectors to assess the degree of hazard posed by ACBM in schools to
determine the scope and timing of appropriate response actions needed for schools. Project designers determine
how asbestos abatement work should be conducted. Lastly, workers and contractor/supervisors carry out and oversee
abatement work. In addition, a recommended training curriculum is also presented for a sixth discipline, which is
not federally-accredited, that of ``Project Monitor.'' Each accredited discipline and training curriculum is
separate and distinct from the others. A person seeking accreditation in any of the five accredited MAP disciplines
cannot attend two or more courses concurrently, but may attend such courses sequentially. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several instances, initial training courses for a specific discipline (e.g., workers, inspectors) require hands-on
training. For asbestos abatement contractor/supervisors and workers, hands-on training should include working
with asbestos-substitute materials, fitting and using respirators, use of glovebags, donning protective clothing,
and constructing a decontamination unit as well as other abatement work activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Workers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A person must be accredited as a worker to carry out any of the following activities with respect to friable ACBM in a
school or public and commercial building: (1) A response action other than a SSSD activity, (2) a maintenance activity
that disturbs friable ACBM other than a SSSD activity, or (3) a response action for a major fiber release episode. All
persons seeking accreditation as asbestos abatement workers shall complete at least a 4&hyph;day training course
as outlined below. The 4&hyph;day worker training course shall include lectures, demonstrations, at least 14 hours
of hands-on training, individual respirator fit testing, course review, and an examination. Hands-on training
must permit workers to have actual experience performing tasks associated with asbestos abatement. A person who
is otherwise accredited as a contractor/supervisor may perform in the role of a worker without possessing separate
accreditation as a worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of cultural diversity associated with the asbestos workforce, EPA recommends that States adopt specific
standards for the approval of foreign language courses for abatement workers. EPA further recommends the use of audio-visual
materials to complement lectures, where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

as a building owner's representative to ensure that abatement work is completed according to specification and in
compliance with all relevant statutes and regulations. They may also perform the vital role of air monitoring for
purposes of determining final clearance. EPA recommends that a State seeking to accredit individuals as project
monitors consider adopting a minimum 5&hyph;day training course covering the topics outlined below. The course
outlined below consists of lectures and demonstrations, at least 6 hours of hands-on training, course review, and
a written examination. The hands-on training component might be satisfied by having the student simulate participation
in or performance of any of the relevant job functions or activities (or by incorporation of the workshop component
described in item ``n'' below of this unit).

C. Examinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each State shall administer a closed book examination or designate other entities such as State-approved providers
of training courses to administer the closed-book examination to persons seeking accreditation who have completed
an initial training course. Demonstration testing may also be included as part of the examination. A person seeking
initial accreditation in a specific discipline must pass the examination for that discipline in order to receive
accreditation. For example, a person seeking accreditation as an abatement project designer must pass the State's
examination for abatement project designer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States may develop their own examinations, have providers of training courses develop examinations, or use standardized
examinations developed for purposes of accreditation under TSCA Title II. In addition, States may supplement standardized
examinations with questions about State regulations. States may obtain commercially developed standardized examinations,
develop standardized examinations independently, or do so in cooperation with other States, or with commercial
or non-profit providers on a regional or national basis. EPA recommends the use of standardized, scientifically-validated
testing instruments, which may be beneficial in terms of both promoting competency and in fostering accreditation
reciprocity between States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each examination shall adequately cover the topics included in the training course for that discipline. Each person
who completes a training course, passes the required examination, and fulfills whatever other requirements the
State imposes must receive an accreditation certificate in a specific discipline. Whether a State directly issues
accreditation certificates, or authorizes training providers to issue accreditation certificates, each certificate
issued to an accredited person must contain the following minimum information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A unique certificate number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Name of accredited person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Discipline of the training course completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Dates of the training course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Date of the examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. An expiration date of 1 year after the date upon which the person successfully completed the course and examination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. The name, address, and telephone number of the training provider that issued the certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. A statement that the person receiving the certificate has completed the requisite training for asbestos accreditation
under TSCA Title II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States or training providers who reaccredit persons based upon completion of required refresher training must also
provide accreditation certificates with all of the above information, except the examination date may be omitted
if a State does not require a refresher examination for reaccreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a State licenses accredited persons but has authorized training providers to issue accreditation certificates,
the State may issue licenses in the form of photo-identification cards. Where this applies, EPA recommends that the
State licenses should include all of the same information required for the accreditation certificates. A State may
also choose to issue photo-identification cards in addition to the required accreditation certificates. Accredited
persons must have their initial and current accreditation certificates at the location where they are conducting
work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The following are the requirements for examination in each discipline: a. Worker: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 50 multiple-choice questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Continuing Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For all disciplines, a State's accreditation program shall include annual refresher training as a requirement for
reaccreditation as indicated below: 1. Workers: One full day of refresher training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Contractor/Supervisors: One full day of refresher training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Inspectors: One half-day of refresher training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Management Planners: One half-day of inspector refresher training and one half-day of refresher training for
management planners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Project Designers: One full day of refresher training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The refresher courses shall be specific to each discipline. Refresher courses shall be conducted as separate and
distinct courses and not combined with any other training during the period of the refresher course. For each discipline,
the refresher course shall review and discuss changes in Federal, State, and local regulations, developments in
state-of-the-art procedures, and a review of key aspects of the initial training course as determined by the State.
After completing the annual refresher course, persons shall have their accreditation extended for an additional
year from the date of the refresher course. A State may consider requiring persons to pass reaccreditation examinations
at specific intervals (for example, every 3 years). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recommends that States formally establish a 12-month grace period to enable formerly accredited persons with
expired certificates to complete refresher training and have their accreditation status reinstated without having
to re-take the initial training course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Qualifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to requiring training and an examination, a State may require candidates for accreditation to meet other
qualification and/or experience standards that the State considers appropriate for some or all disciplines. States
may choose to consider requiring qualifications similar to the examples outlined below for inspectors, management
planners and project designers. States may modify these examples as appropriate. In addition, States may want to
include some requirements based on experience in performing a task directly as a part of a job or in an apprenticeship
role. They may also wish to consider additional criteria for the approval of training course instructors beyond those
prescribed by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Inspectors: Qualifications - possess a high school diploma. States may want to require an Associate's Degree in
specific fields (e.g., environmental or physical sciences). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Management Planners: Qualifications - Registered architect, engineer, or certified industrial hygienist or
related scientific field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Project Designers: Qualifications - registered architect, engineer, or certified industrial hygienist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Asbestos Training Course Instructor: Qualifications - academic credentials and/or field experience in asbestos
abatement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recommends that States prescribe minimum qualification standards for training instructors employed by training
providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Recordkeeping Requirements for Training Providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All approved providers of accredited asbestos training courses must comply with the following minimum recordkeeping
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Training course materials. A training provider must retain copies of all instructional materials used in the delivery
of the classroom training such as student manuals, instructor notebooks and handouts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Instructor qualifications. A training provider must retain copies of all instructors' resumes, and the documents
approving each instructor issued by either EPA or a State. Instructors must be approved by either EPA or a State before
teaching courses for accreditation purposes. A training provider must notify EPA or the State, as appropriate, in
advance whenever it changes course instructors. Records must accurately identify the instructors that taught each
particular course for each date that a course is offered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Examinations. A training provider must document that each person who receives an accreditation certificate for
an initial training course has achieved a passing score on the examination. These records must clearly indicate the
date upon which the exam was administered, the training course and discipline for which the exam was given, the name
of the person who proctored the exam, a copy of the exam, and the name and test score of each person taking the exam. The
topic and dates of the training course must correspond to those listed on that person's accreditation certificate.
States may choose to apply these same requirements to examinations for refresher training courses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Accreditation certificates. The training providers or States, whichever issues the accreditation certificate,
shall maintain records that document the names of all persons who have been awarded certificates, their certificate
numbers, the disciplines for which accreditation was conferred, training and expiration dates, and the training
location. The training provider or State shall maintain the records in a manner that allows verification by telephone
of the required information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Verification of certificate information. EPA recommends that training providers of refresher training courses
confirm that their students possess valid accreditation before granting course admission. EPA further recommends
that training providers offering the initial management planner training course verify that students have met the
prerequisite of possessing valid inspector accreditation at the time of course admission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Records retention and access. (a) The training provider shall maintain all required records for a minimum of 3 years.
The training provider, however, may find it advantageous to retain these records for a longer period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The training provider must allow reasonable access to all of the records required by the MAP, and to any other records
which may be required by States for the approval of asbestos training providers or the accreditation of asbestos training
courses, to both EPA and to State Agencies, on request. EPA encourages training providers to make this information
equally accessible to the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If a training provider ceases to conduct training, the training provider shall notify the approving government
body (EPA or the State) and give it the opportunity to take possession of that providers asbestos training records.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Deaccreditation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. States must establish criteria and procedures for deaccrediting persons accredited as workers, contractor/supervisors,
inspectors, management planners, and project designers. States must follow their own administrative procedures
in pursuing deaccreditation actions. At a minimum, the criteria shall include: (a) Performing work requiring accreditation
at a job site without being in physical possession of initial and current accreditation certificates; (b) Permitting
the duplication or use of one's own accreditation certificate by another; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Performing work for which accreditation has not been received; or (d) Obtaining accreditation from a training
provider that does not have approval to offer training for the particular discipline from either EPA or from a State
that has a contractor accreditation plan at least as stringent as the EPA MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may directly pursue deaccreditation actions without reliance on State deaccreditation or enforcement authority
or actions. In addition to the above-listed situations, the Administrator may suspend or revoke the accreditation
of persons who have been subject to a final order imposing a civil penalty or convicted under section 16 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C.
2615 or 2647, for violations of 40 CFR part 763, or section 113 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7413, for violations of
40 CFR part 61, subpart M. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Any person who performs asbestos work requiring accreditation under section 206(a) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(a),
without such accreditation is in violation of TSCA. The following persons are not accredited for purposes of section
206(a) of TSCA: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Any person who obtains accreditation through fraudulent representation of training or examination documents;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any person who obtains training documentation through fraudulent means; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Any person who gains admission to and completes refresher training through fraudulent representation of initial
or previous refresher training documentation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any person who obtains accreditation through fraudulent representation of accreditation requirements such
as education, training, professional registration, or experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Reciprocity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recommends that each State establish reciprocal arrangements with other States that have established accreditation
programs that meet or exceed the requirements of the MAP. Such arrangements might address cooperation in licensing
determinations, the review and approval of training programs and/or instructors, candidate testing and exam administration,
curriculum development, policy formulation, compliance monitoring, and the exchange of information and data.
The benefits to be derived from these arrangements include a potential cost-savings from the reduction of duplicative
activity and the attainment of a more professional accredited workforce as States are able to refine and improve the
effectiveness of their programs based upon the experience and methods of other States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. EPA Approval Process for State Accreditation Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. States may seek approval for a single discipline or all disciplines as specified in the MAP. For example, a State
that currently only requires worker accreditation may receive EPA approval for that discipline alone. EPA encourages
States that currently do not have accreditation requirements for all disciplines required under section 206(b)(2)
of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(2), to seek EPA approval for those disciplines the State does accredit. As States establish
accreditation requirements for the remaining disciplines, the requested information outlined below should be
submitted to EPA as soon as possible. Any State that had an accreditation program approved by EPA under an earlier version
of the MAP may follow the same procedures to obtain EPA approval of their accreditation program under this MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Partial approval of a State Program for the accreditation of one or more disciplines does not mean that the State
is in full compliance with TSCA where the deadline for that State to have adopted a State Plan no less stringent than
the MAP has already passed. State Programs which are at least as stringent as the MAP for one or more of the accredited
disciplines may, however, accredit persons in those disciplines only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. States seeking EPA approval or reapproval of accreditation programs shall submit the following information to
the Regional Asbestos Coordinator at their EPA Regional office: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A copy of the legislation establishing or upgrading the State's accreditation program (if applicable). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A copy of the State's accreditation regulations or revised regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A letter to the Regional Asbestos Coordinator that clearly indicates how the State meets the program requirements
of this MAP. Addresses for each of the Regional Asbestos Coordinators are shown below:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Individuals or groups wishing to sponsor training courses for disciplines required to be accredited under section
206(b)(1)(A) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(1)(A), may apply for approval from States that have accreditation program
requirements that are at least as stringent as this MAP. For a course to receive approval, it must meet the requirements
for the course as outlined in this MAP, and any other requirements imposed by the State from which approval is being
sought. Courses that have been approved by a State with an accreditation program at least as stringent as this MAP are
approved under section 206(a) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(a), for that particular State, and also for any other State that
does not have an accreditation program as stringent as this MAP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Refresher Training Course Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following minimum information is required for approval of refresher training courses by States: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The length of training in half-days or days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The topics covered in the course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A copy of all course materials (student manuals, instructor notebooks, handouts, etc.).

and pass the examination, if required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Withdrawal of Training Course Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
States must establish criteria and procedures for suspending or withdrawing approval from accredited training
programs. States should follow their own administrative procedures in pursuing actions for suspension or withdrawal
of approval of training programs. At a minimum, the criteria shall include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Misrepresentation of the extent of a training course's approval by a State or EPA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Failure to submit required information or notifications in a timely manner; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Failure to maintain requisite records; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Falsification of accreditation records, instructor qualifications, or other accreditation information;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Failure to adhere to the training standards and requirements of the EPA MAP or State Accreditation Program, as
appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the criteria listed above, EPA may also suspend or withdraw a training course's approval where an approved
training course instructor, or other person with supervisory authority over the delivery of training has been found
in violation of other asbestos regulations administered by EPA. An administrative or judicial finding of violation,
or execution of a consent agreement and order under 40 CFR 22.18, constitutes evidence of a failure to comply with relevant
statutes or regulations. States may wish to adopt this criterion modified to include their own asbestos statutes
or regulations. EPA may also suspend or withdraw approval of training programs where a training provider has submitted
false information as a part of the self-certification required under Unit V.B. of the revised MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training course providers shall permit representatives of EPA or the State which approved their training courses
to attend, evaluate, and monitor any training course without charge. EPA or State compliance inspection staff are
not required to give advance notice of their inspections. EPA may suspend or withdraw State or EPA approval of a training
course based upon the criteria specified in this Unit III.C.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. EPA Procedures for Suspension or Revocation of Accreditation or Training Course Approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. If the Administrator decides to suspend or revoke the accreditation of any person or suspend or withdraw the approval

c. Issue accreditation pursuant to an earlier version of the MAP that provisionally satisfies the requirement for
TSCA accreditation until October 4, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a State may not approve new TSCA training course providers to conduct training or to issue TSCA accreditation
that satisfies the requirements of this MAP until the State adopts an accreditation plan that is at least as stringent
as this MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A State that had complied with an earlier version of the MAP, but fails to adopt a plan as stringent as this MAP by the
deadline established in Unit V.A.1., is subject to the following after that deadline date: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The State loses any status it may have held as an EPA-approved State for accreditation purposes under section 206
of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. All training course providers approved by the State lose State approval to conduct training and issue accreditation
that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation under this MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Requirements applicable to Training Courses and Providers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As of October 4, 1994, an approved training provider must certify to EPA and to any State that has approved the provider
for TSCA accreditation, that each of the provider's training courses complies with the requirements of this MAP.
The written submission must document in specific detail the changes made to each training course in order to comply
with the requirements of this MAP and clearly state that the provider is also in compliance with all other requirements
of this MAP, including the new recordkeeping and certificate provisions. Each submission must include the following
statement signed by an authorized representative of the training provider: ``Under civil and criminal penalties
of law for the making or submission of false or fraudulent statements or representations (18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15 U.S.C.
2615), I certify that the training described in this submission complies with all applicable requirements of Title
II of TSCA, 40 CFR part 763, Appendix C to Subpart E, as revised, and any other applicable Federal, state, or local requirements.''
A consolidated self-certification submission from each training provider that addresses all of its approved training
courses is permissible and encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The self-certification must be sent via registered mail, to EPA Headquarters at the following address: Attn. Self-Certification
Program, Field Programs Branch, Chemical Management Division (7404), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics,
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. A duplicate copy of the complete submission
must also be sent to any States from which approval had been obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The timely receipt of a complete self-certification by EPA and all approving States shall have the effect of extending
approval under this MAP to the training courses offered by the submitting provider. If a self-certification is not
received by the approving government bodies on or before the due date, the affected training course is not approved
under this MAP. Such training providers must then reapply for approval of these training courses pursuant to the procedures
outlined in Unit III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Requirements applicable to Accredited Persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons accredited by a State with an accreditation program no less stringent than an earlier version of the MAP or
by an EPA-approved training provider as of April 3, 1994, are accredited in accordance with the requirements of this
MAP, and are not required to retake initial training. They must continue to comply with the requirements for annual
refresher training in Unit I.D. of the revised MAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Requirements applicable to Non-Accredited Persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to perform work requiring accreditation under TSCA Title II, persons who are not accredited by a State with
an accreditation program no less stringent than an earlier version of the MAP or by an EPA-approved training provider
as of April 3, 1994, must comply with the upgraded training requirements of this MAP by no later than October 4, 1994.
Non-accredited persons may obtain initial accreditation on a provisional basis by successfully completing any
of the training programs approved under an earlier version of the MAP, and thereby perform work during the first 6 months
after this MAP takes effect. However, by October 4, 1994, these persons must have successfully completed an upgraded
training program that fully complies with the requirements of this MAP in order to continue to perform work requiring
accreditation under section 206 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document modifies the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) distribution formula to allow States
with incompatible intrastate regulations limited participation in only the basic grant program beyond October
1, 1994. It does not change the distribution formula pertaining to those States that have achieved compatibility
with respect to both interstate and intrastate transportation. The revised formula is necessary to provide continued
funding for States that have not achieved full compatibility in the enforcement of safety regulations applicable
to intrastate transportation. Such States will be qualified through formula allocation, rather than suffering
absolute loss of eligibility after September 30, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) was first authorized in the Surface Transportation Assistance
Act of 1982 (sec. 404, Pub. L. 97&hyph;424, 96 Stat. 2097, 2156) and most recently reauthorized by the Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (sec. 4002, Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 2140) which was signed
into law on December 19, 1991. The original authorization contained certain conditions States had to meet to be eligible
for funding. One such condition required each State to adopt and enforce commercial motor vehicle safety regulations
which are compatible with the Federal requirements. Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 350 was amended
by a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 8, 1992 (57 FR 40946), to reflect the mandates of the ISTEA. The amended rule, among other things, defined
compatibility, with respect to interstate applicability, to mean identical with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Regulations (FMCSR) and, with respect to intrastate applicability, to mean within the Tolerance Guidelines. The
rule also required interstate compatibility to be achieved not later than October 1, 1993. The FHWA's Tolerance Guidelines,
which set the compatibility requirements for intrastate regulations, were included in the new regulation as appendix
C to part 350 and future funding under MCSAP was conditioned on achieving intrastate compatibility by October 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With this rulemaking, the FHWA is modifying part 350 to allow partial funding of States notwithstanding intrastate
incompatibility. States that have not achieved full intrastate compatibility will receive 50 percent of their basic
formula allocation. The formula funds which are withheld from those States which do not have compatible intrastate
regulations will be made available to States with compatible comprehensive programs to conduct certain high priority
projects that are innovative, successful, cost-effective and cost-efficient. This change is consistent with the
legislative direction in the ISTEA to develop an improved distribution formula that both promotes innovative programs
and provides incentives to States that increase compatibility, section 4002(k), Public Law 102&hyph;240. It rewards
those States that have fully compatible interstate and intrastate safety regulations, encourages comprehensive
programs, and provides funds for high priority areas. The amendment will also enable the FHWA to maintain a basic commercial
motor vehicle inspection program uniformly and universally applied by the States through the continued availability
of Federal funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA emphasizes that States must continue to meet the requirement for interstate compatibility, and this interim
final rule change will not affect that requirement. The FHWA believes that fully compatible safety and hazardous
materials regulations are an essential element of MCSAP. Through the MCSAP, the FHWA, the States, and the Commercial
Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) have developed a coordinated, nationwide program of uniform inspections, enforcement,
and data collection. This avoids duplication of efforts by the States and promotes compliance by the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modification made by this interim final rule continues the progress made through MCSAP by permitting States with
only intrastate variances to continue to participate in the basic program while providing a strong incentive for
them to adopt and enforce compatible intrastate regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Compatible Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A major goal of the MCSAP is to achieve nationwide uniform regulations, laws, and practices. The FHWA has determined
that forty-nine States, the District of Columbia, and three territories have adopted compatible rules applicable
to interstate commerce. Thirty-six States and territories have adopted compatible intrastate rules. This is indicative
of the significant progress that the States and the FHWA have made largely through the MCSAP toward reaching the goal
of national uniform commercial motor vehicle safety regulations and enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ideally, State commercial motor vehicle laws would exactly mirror Federal regulations. Indeed, the States are encouraged
to adopt regulations applicable to both interstate and intrastate commerce which are identical to the Federal regulations.
Moreover, the FHWA strongly encourages States to implement a system which allows them to automatically adopt any
new Federal regulation, which would preclude any question of future incompatibility and reduce the chance of an interruption
in the States' MCSAP funding. The FHWA recognizes, however, that circumstances may exist which make complete adoption
by the States difficult. The FHWA has therefore provided the States with limited flexibility, through the Tolerance
Guidelines, to address these local issues. In accordance with the ISTEA mandate to issue these guidelines in formal
regulations, they were included in the FMCSRs as appendix C to part 350 (57 FR 174, September 8, 1992). The Tolerance
Guidelines define the extent to which intrastate regulations can differ from the FMCSRs, yet still be considered
to be compatible. Additional differences and industry exemptions are strongly discouraged. In order to gain FHWA's
approval of additional differences, a State must carry a heavy burden of demonstrating that the difference would
have little impact on commercial vehicle safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without this modification to part 350, 13 of the States who are currently participating in MCSAP may not qualify for
any MCSAP formula grants in fiscal year (FY) 1995. These States (Alaska, Arizona, California, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine,
Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wisconsin) are allocated a combined
total of $16.7 million in Federal funds. These States conducted a combined total of 530,886 of the 1.6 million driver/vehicle
inspections done in FY 1992. If the current part 350 requirements are not changed as provided in this rule, these States
will no longer receive any MCSAP funding, which provides a significant portion of the resources for them to conduct
roadside commercial vehicle and driver inspections, safety and compliance reviews, uniform accident and safety
data collection, drug and alcohol abatement programs and other similar activities which have contributed to the
significant reduction of commercial vehicle accidents on our nation's highways since MCSAP began in FY 1984. Thus,
the FHWA has concluded that total loss of MCSAP funds for these States with some remaining intrastate incompatible
rules and regulations would have an adverse impact on commercial motor vehicle safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This change will allow for distribution of 50 percent of the basic formula allocation to those States which have incompatible
intrastate regulations after September 30, 1994. The FHWA has determined that a 50 percent reduction in an incompatible
State's basic formula is significant enough to serve as an incentive to the State to enact compatible laws. It is believed
that a lesser reduction would not send as strong a message to those States which still have incompatible regulations.
Without this change in Part 350, the States with incompatible regulations would not be eligible to receive any Federal
MCSAP funding for FY 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formula funds which are withheld from those States which do not have compatible intrastate regulations will be
made available to States with comprehensive programs to conduct certain high priority projects that are innovative,
successful, cost-efficient and cost-effective. See &sect;4002(k) of the ISTEA. States with incompatible intrastate
regulations may also request these funds for activities aimed at achieving a comprehensive program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comprehensive program is one in which a State has and enforces compatible regulations which pertain to both interstate
and intrastate transportation and has a motor carrier safety program which includes roadside inspections; compliance
reviews; traffic enforcement; hazardous materials training; drug and alcohol enforcement; a fully-implemented
SAFETYNET program, including the National Governors Association accident data collection, and as otherwise defined
by FHWA policy. The FHWA believes that States which integrate these activities into their MCSAP have the most effective,
cost efficient, and successful commercial vehicle safety programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with comprehensive programs which are applying for these redistributed funds should request these funds
for high priority projects. High priority projects are those projects identified by FHWA, in consultation with the
States, as having the highest impact on commercial motor vehicle and driver safety. Generally, the FHWA would not
support the use of these funds for activities that create one-time personnel hiring which could not be funded in following
years. High priority projects will change from year to year to support the growth of the program. Current high priority
projects include advanced brake inspection technologies, roadside data collection and communication devices,
border enforcement to support the North American Free Trade Agreement, local commercial vehicle enforcement, and
drug and alcohol enforcement activities.

to ``inapplicable'' in paragraph 350.11(a). This subsection provides the discretion to allow funding notwithstanding
the incompatibility of State laws and regulations applicable to intrastate commerce.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA has waived prior notice and opportunity for public comment on this rule because it believes that such prior
notice and opportunity for public comment, at this time, would be contrary to public interest within the meaning of
section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final MCSAP rule published on September 8, 1992, indicated that States must achieve compatibility with Federal
safety rules within published Tolerance Guidelines by October 1, 1994, the first day of Federal fiscal year 1995.
Based on State submissions for Federal fiscal year 1994, the FHWA now believes that 13 States have not yet achieved
an acceptable level of compliance for intrastate safety rules and, unless changes are made in such State laws, these
States will lose all MCSAP funding on October 1, 1994. Each of these States, however, has achieved full interstate
compliance and substantial intrastate compliance. The FHWA has decided that it should revise the amount of MCSAP
funds subject to reduction due to a lack of intrastate compatibility to ensure that important safety programs may
be continued in the States while providing an incentive to States to achieve further intrastate compatibility with
Federal motor carrier safety rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By promulgating an interim final rule at this time, the FHWA hopes to provide State legislatures sufficient time to
consider amendments to State laws, if necessary. Typically, State legislatures meet during the first three months
of the calendar year. While the FHWA notes that the effect of this interim final rule is to lessen the reduction in MCSAP
funds States will experience unless they revise their intrastate rules, the FHWA also recognizes that this action
will reinforce for the States the consequences of this incompatibility. Concurrent with this action, the FHWA is
writing to the 13 affected States explaining the basis for determining that their intrastate rules do not fall within
the Tolerance Guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Likewise, the FHWA believes that adopting an interim final rule at this time will provide State agencies with adequate
time to adjust their programs to accommodate lower MCSAP funding levels before October 1, 1994. If the FHWA delays
this action to accept public comment before taking the action, the FHWA believes that States will not have adequate
notice before October 1, 1994, to take action to avoid the reduction in MCSAP funds or to plan accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the FHWA finds that it would be contrary to the public interest to provide notice and opportunity
for public comment before issuing this rule. Nevertheless, the FHWA is opening a public docket for this rule and providing
60 days for the receipt of public comment. The FHWA will consider all comments received during this 60 day period in
determining whether any revision is necessary to the rule published today.

The FHWA has determined that this document does not contain significant regulatory action under Executive Order
12866 or a significant regulation under the regulatory polices and procedures of the DOT. It is anticipated that the
economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. There
should be no economic impact on private entities as the action is entirely related to adjusting distribution of funds
to public entities to maintain or enhance enforcement of safety regulations. This rule will allow the 13 States with
identified intrastate incompatibilities to remain in the MCSAP at a 50 percent funding level. The additional funds
made available from these incompatible States will potentially provide increased funding for innovative and high
priority projects for the States with comprehensive programs.

In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of
this rule on small entities. Based on the evaluation, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule relates to the requirements States must meet
to qualify for Federal funding under the MCSAP. This rule does not impose any direct requirement on small entities
that will result in increased economic costs.

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.
This is a grant program to induce States to adopt compatible safety regulations. The effect of the change adopted today
will be to reduce the impact on States that have made substantial efforts to adopt compatible regulations, but which
do not fully comply. The action increases the individual discretion of States which would otherwise lose access to
Federal funds because of exemptions and other tolerances applicable to wholly intrastate transportation.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) exercises its emergency authority to determine the Pacific pocket mouse
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus longimembris pacificus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) to be an endangered species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Prior to 1993, this species
had not been observed in over 20 years. The Pacific pocket mouse was rediscovered on the Dana Point Headlands, Orange
County, California, during July 1993. No more than 39 individuals are known to exist despite relatively intensive,
recent surveys in all of the remaining, undisturbed locales where the species historically occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only known existing Pacific pocket mouse population is imminently threatened by a land development project and
depredation by feral and/or domestic cats. Because of the need to make Federal funding, protection, and other measures
immediately available to protect this species and its habitat, the Service finds that an emergency rule action is
justified. This emergency rule provides Federal protection pursuant to the Act for this species for a period of 240
days. A proposed rule to list the Pacific pocket mouse as endangered is published concurrently with this emergency
rule in this same

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pacific pocket mouse (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus longimembris pacificus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is 1 of 19 recognized subspecies of the little pocket mouse (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus longimembris
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Hall 1981), a species that is widely distributed throughout arid regions of the western United States and northwestern
Mexico. It is the smallest member of the family Heteromyidae, which consists of spiny pocket mice (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Heteromys and Liomys
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), pocket mice (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus and Chaetodipus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), kangaroo rats (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dipodomys
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and kangaroo mice (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Microdipodops
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Virtually all members of this family are nocturnal, granivorous, and have external, deep, fur-lined cheek pouches
(Ingles 1965; P. Brylski, consulting mammalogist, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The little pocket mouse is about 110 to 148 millimeters (mm) (4.3 to 6 inches (in)) long from nose to tip of tail. Its body
pelage is spineless, bristle-free, and predominately brown, pinkish buff, or ochraceous buff above and light brown,
pale tawny, buff, or whitish below. Two small patches of lighter hairs typically exist at the base of the ear. The tail
can be either distinctly or indistinctly bicolored. The soles of the hind feet are hairy (Hall 1981). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific pocket mouse is the smallest subspecies of the little pocket mouse, ranging from about 110 to 126 mm (4.3
to 4.9 in) long from nose to tip of tail. The tail, hind foot, and skull lengths and the size of skull structures are also
the smallest of all little pocket mouse subspecies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Los Angeles pocket mouse (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus longimembris brevinasus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which occurs mostly northeast of and more interior than the Pacific pocket mouse, is the only other subspecies of
little pocket mouse in cismontane southern California, is 125 to 145 mm (4.9 to 5.7 in) in total length, and has a longer
tail, hind foot, and skull than the Pacific pocket mouse. The nasal bones in the skull of the Los Angeles pocket mouse
are also considerably larger than those of the Pacific pocket mouse (Huey 1939). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific pocket mouse was originally described by Mearns (1898) as a distinct species, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus pacificus, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
based on the type specimen from San Diego County, California. von Bloeker (1931a,b) later recognized the Pacific
pocket mouse as a distinct species, but subsequently concluded that the morphology of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. pacificus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
was not sufficiently distinct from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. longimembris 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to maintain the Pacific pocket mouse as a distinct species. von Bloeker reduced 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. pacificus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. longimembris pacificus. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
von Bloeker also described a second coastal subspecies, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. longimembris cantwelli, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
from El Segundo in Los Angeles County, California (von Bloeker 1932). After an analysis of 331 specimens of the little
pocket mouse, Huey (1939) recognized 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. l. pacificus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to include the two subspecies described by von Bloeker (1932). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a taxonomic review of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. longimembris 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
may be appropriate, Williams (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993) indicated that ``the Pacific pocket mouse is distinct.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific pocket mouse occurs within about 3 kilometers (km) (2 miles (mi)) of the immediate coast of southern California
from Marina del Rey and El Segundo in Los Angeles County south to the vicinity of the Mexican border in San Diego County
(Hall 1981, Williams 1986, Erickson 1993) and below 180 meters (m) (600 feet (ft)) in elevation (Erickson 1993). Although
the range map in Hall (1981) suggests that the range of the Pacific pocket mouse may extend into northwestern Baja California,
Mexico, this subspecies has never been recorded outside of California (Erickson 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific pocket mouse occurs on fine-grain, sandy substrates in the immediate vicinity of the Pacific Ocean (Mearns
1898, von Bloeker 1931a, Grinnell 1933, Bailey 1939). The Pacific pocket mouse inhabits coastal strand, coastal
dunes, river alluvium, and coastal sage scrub growing on marine terraces (Grinnell 1933, Meserve 1972, Erickson
1993). Brylski (1993) detected the only known extant population on the Dana Point Headlands on loose sand substrates
in a coastal sage scrub community dominated by California buckwheat (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eriogonum fasiculatum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and California sage (

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pacific pocket mouse is likely facultatively or partially fossorial, relatively sedentary, and able to become
torpid, estivate, or hibernate in response to adverse environmental conditions (Ingles 1965, Vaughan 1978, Zeiner

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While active above ground, little pocket mice have ranged up to 320 m (1,000 ft) from their burrows in a 24-hour period
(Burt and Grossenheider 1976). Little pocket mouse home ranges vary in size from 0.12 to 0.56 hectares (0.30 to 1.4
acres), and populations range in density from 1 to 5.5 individuals per hectare (0.4 to 2.2 individuals per acre) (Chew
and Butterworth 1964). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pacific pocket mice primarily eat the seeds of grasses and forbs, but occasionally eat leafy material and soil-dwelling
insects (von Bloeker 1931a; Meserve 1976a; Jameson and Peeters 1988; P. Brylski, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The little pocket mouse has a high metabolic rate (Bartholomew and Cade 1957), continually needs food supplies while
active, and loses heat rapidly. It has limited capacity to store food. Little pocket mice may stay in their burrows
continuously for up to 5 months in winter, alternating between periods of dormancy and feeding on stored seeds or hibernation
in winter under adverse conditions (Bartholomew and Cade 1957, Ingles 1965, Kenagy 1973, Whitaker 1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Little pocket mice live up to 7.5 years in captivity and 3 to 5 years in the wild (Burt and Grossenheider 1976, Whitaker
1980). Pregnant and lactating females have been found from April through June, and immatures have been reported from
June through September (Erickson 1993). Burt and Grossenheider (1976) previously reported that the little pocket
mouse produces one or two litters (ranging in size from three to seven young) in a year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific pocket mouse is historically known from eight populations. Approximately 80 percent of all Pacific pocket
mouse records are from 1931 or 1932 (Erickson 1993). The following summarizes the historical distribution of the
Pacific pocket mouse by county: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Los Angeles County.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Pacific pocket mouse historically was detected in three areas: Marina del Rey/El Segundo, Wilmington, and Clifton.
No records of the Pacific pocket mouse exist in Los Angeles County since 1938 (P. Brylski, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Orange County.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Pacific pocket mouse has been found at two locales in Orange County: Dana Point and the San Joaquin Hills. The species
was found on ``Spyglass Hill'' in the San Joaquin Hills from 1968 to 1971 (Erickson 1993). G.G. Cantwell previously
collected 10 specimens at the Dana Point Headlands in 1932.

San Diego County.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Pacific pocket mouse has been detected at three general locales in San Diego County: the San Onofre area, Santa
Margarita River Estuary, and the lower Tijuana River Valley. Another report of a single Pacific pocket mouse in suitable
habitat from Lux Canyon, Encinitas, in June 1989 is now considered probable by the observer (Erickson 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only known extant population of the Pacific pocket mouse was rediscovered in July 1993 on the Dana Point Headlands
in Orange County, California. Between 25 to 39 individual Pacific pocket mice were detected during trapping surveys
conducted into August 1993 (Brylski 1993). This was the first time the Pacific pocket mouse had been collected at this
site since 1971 (Erickson 1993). Numerous small-mammal survey and trapping efforts within its historical range
(D. Erickson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993; Erickson 1993) have failed to locate any additional populations. The remaining site is imminently threatened
by a development that is expected to receive final approval in the very near future.

Previous Federal Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pacific pocket mouse was designated by the Service as a category 2 candidate species for Federal listing as endangered
or threatened in 1985 (50 FR 37966). It was retained in this category in subsequent notices of review published by the
Service in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in 1989 and 1991 (54 FR 554 and 56 FR 58804, respectively). Category 2 comprises taxa for which information now in the
possession of the Service indicates that proposing to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate,
but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat are not currently available to support proposed
rules. The Service made the determination to list this species on the basis of new information received in 1993 that
resulted in the elevation of the Pacific pocket mouse to category 1 status. Category 1 comprises taxa for which the
Service has on file sufficient information to support proposals for endangered or threatened status.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that the Pacific
pocket mouse should be classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4 of the Act and regulations
(50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determined
to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These
factors and their application to the Pacific pocket mouse (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus longimembris pacificus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although originally known from eight locales, the Pacific pocket mouse now occurs in one site on the Dana Point Headlands
of Dana Point in Orange County. Although the Dana Point Headlands have remained relatively unchanged since the Pacific
pocket mouse was first detected at this locale, a land development project has been approved by the Planning Commission,
with final approval anticipated in early 1994. This proposed residential and hotel complex project would result
in the removal of 3.65 acres of the 3.75 acres of habitat that Brylski (1993) identified as being occupied by Pacific
pocket mice (EDAW 1993b). Grading that would destroy the only known Pacific pocket mouse population may proceed upon
final approval of the proposed project. This site is also threatened by fuel modification for fire protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Los Angeles County, two of the three historic locales for the Pacific pocket mouse (Clifton and Wilmington) have
been developed, and the third (Marina del Rey/El Segundo) has been substantially altered since the species was last
detected there. Recent surveys have been unsuccessful in relocating the species in the vicinity of Marina del Rey
or El Segundo. The Hyperion area, which formerly contained relatively large expanses of coastal strand and wetland
habitats, has been extensively developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Orange County, the development of the Spyglass Hill area began in 1972. This development resulted in the destruction
of the formerly occupied habitat at that site.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although portions of the San Onofre area and the Santa Margarita River mouth in San Diego County remain relatively
undisturbed, recent survey and small mammal trapping efforts at these locations failed to detect the presence of
the Pacific pocket mouse (P. Brylski, pers. comm., 1993; R. Erickson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993; Erickson 1993; R. Zembal, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). During the 1930s, Camp Pendleton
Marine Corps Base did not exist and the city of Oceanside was immediately adjacent to the Santa Margarita River estuary.
Much of the southern half of the Santa Margarita River estuary was destroyed in the early 1940s during the establishment
of Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base and the related construction of a boat basin and harbor facilities. In addition,
the Oceanside area has been extensively developed since the Pacific pocket mouse was last recorded there in 1931,
and little, if any, suitable habitat remains at that location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the lower Tijuana River Valley evidently supported a relatively large population of the Pacific pocket
mouse in the early 1930s, this area has been substantially altered and currently provides little, if any, suitable
habitat. Recent trapping efforts have failed to detect the Pacific pocket mouse at this location (Taylor and Tiszler
1991; R.T. Miller, pers. comm. to Erickson, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another potential site for the Pacific pocket mouse is Lux Canyon in Encinitas, San Diego County, where an unverified
sighting occurred in 1989. However, the majority of Lux Canyon has already been converted to urban development and
agriculture. The remaining habitat in Lux Canyon is highly fragmented and subject to additional urban development
(F. Roberts, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Opportunities to find additional populations of the Pacific pocket mouse are limited. Less than 400 hectares (1,000
acres) of about 28,000 hectares (70,000 acres) (1 percent) encompassing the range of the Pacific pocket mouse in Los
Angeles County are undeveloped (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, unpublished data, 1993). About 17,600 hectares
(44,000 acres) of approximately 21,600 hectares (54,000 acres) (81 percent) encompassing the range of the Pacific
pocket mouse in Orange County has been converted to urban uses (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, unpublished data,
1993). Land use patterns in coastal San Diego County are similar. Oberbauer and Vanderwier (1991) reported that 72
percent of coastal sage scrub, 94 percent of native grasslands, 88 percent of coastal mixed chaparral, 88 percent
of coastal salt marsh, 100 percent of coastal strand, and 92 percent of maritime sage scrub habitats in San Diego County
had been converted to urban and agricultural uses by 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional 16 hectares (41 acres) of suitable habitat for the Pacific pocket mouse occurs on the Dana Point Headlands.
However, 13 hectares (32 acres) of this habitat would be eliminated by the same project that threatens the only known
occupied habitat (EDAW 1993b). Additional potential habitat occurs on Pelican Hill in the San Joaquin Hills and along
the coastal bluffs in Crystal Cove State Park. Over 50 percent of the Pelican Hill site was graded in March 1993 with
the remainder approved for development (F. Roberts, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the remaining undeveloped range of the Pacific pocket mouse, areas that contain suitable habitat for the species
represent less than 10 percent of the remaining habitat. This is exemplified by the situation in Orange County, where
identified suitable habitat for the Pacific pocket mouse is restricted to less than 60 hectares (150 acres) (F. Roberts,
pers. comm., 1993).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993). Erickson (1993) has speculated that the red fox ``may have hastened the demise of the Pacific pocket mouse in
the El Segundo area,'' where the species apparently was well-represented historically.

Feral and domestic cats are known to be predators of native rodents (Hubbs 1951, George 1974). Pearson (1964) concluded
that the removal of 4,200 mice from a 14 hectare (35 acre) test plot was accomplished largely by 6 cats over an 8-month
period. Feral and/or domestic cats are threatening the only known population of the Pacific pocket mouse. A resident
living immediately adjacent to the only known population has reported that domestic cats had recently and repeatedly
brought home a number of ``tiny gray mice'' (P. Brylski,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Existing regulatory mechanisms that may provide some protection for the Pacific pocket mouse include: (1) The Federal

(2) the California Natural Community Conservation Planning Program; (3) the California Environmental Quality
Act; (4) land acquisition and management by Federal, State, or local agencies or by private groups and organizations;
and (5) local laws and regulations.

The Pacific pocket mouse is currently classified as a candidate for Federal listing under the Act and as a Species of
Special Concern ``Of Highest Priority'' by the California Department of Fish and Game (Department). However, Federal
candidate species and Department Species of Special Concern have no local status and are afforded no protection under
the Federal or California Endangered Species Acts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only known population of the Pacific pocket mouse is found in conjunction with a population of coastal California
gnatcatchers on the Dana Point Headlands (Brylski 1993; EDAW 1993a,b). The coastal California gnatcatcher's status
as a threatened species gives it protection under the Act. However, the legal authority to protect the gnatcatcher
does not extend to candidate species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under provisions under section 10(a) of the Act, the Service may permit the incidental ``take'' of the gnatcatcher
during the course of an otherwise legal activity as long as the likelihood of that species' survival and recovery in
the wild is not precluded. If the Service authorized take of the gnatcatcher at the Dana Point Headlands pursuant to
section 10(a), the permitted activities could result in the extinction of the Pacific pocket mouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, the State of California established the Natural Communities Conservation Planning Program to address the
conservation needs of natural ecosystems throughout the State. The initial focus of that program is the coastal sage
scrub community occupied, in part, by the Pacific pocket mouse. At the present time, no plans have been completed or
implemented, and no protection is currently proposed to prevent or reduce impacts to 3.65 of the 3.75 acres of occupied
habitat on the Dana Point Headlands that are proposed for development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many cases, land-use planning decisions are made on the basis of environmental review documents prepared in accordance
with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) or the National Environmental Policy Act. These Acts have not
adequately protected Pacific pocket mouse habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A relocation program proposed to mitigate impacts to the Pacific pocket mouse on the Dana Point Headlands (EDAW 1993b)
has not been fully defined or developed and must be considered highly experimental. As part of this proposed mitigation
program, ``the Pacific pocket mouse will be relocated to suitable on-site or off-site locations that are or will be
preserved as suitable habitat'' (EDAW 1993b). EDAW (1993b) has concluded that the ``implementation of this mitigation
will not reduce impacts to this species to a level of insignificance.'' The program proposed in the Dana Point Headlands
to control domestic cat predation is also inadequate.

Other natural or man-made factors affecting its continued existence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This species is highly susceptible to extinction as a result of stochastic environmental or demographic causes because
the remaining animals are found in one location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has determined that listing as endangered is appropriate because the remaining location is imminently
threatened by urban development.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Reasons for Emergency Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 4(b)(7) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and 50 CFR 424.20, the Secretary may determine a species to be endangered or threatened by an emergency rule that shall
cease 240 days following publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The reasons why this rule is necessary are discussed below. If at any time after this rule has been published the Secretary
determines that substantial evidence does not exist to warrant such a rule, it shall be withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the eight known sites historically occupied by the species, all but two have been developed or significantly altered
through human activities. Suitable habitat remains in the Marina del Rey/El Segundo portion of Los Angeles County;
however, efforts to find the animal in this area have not been successful. One other site at San Onofre in San Diego County
still retains suitable habitat. However, the Pacific pocket mouse was never common at this site, and recent surveys
have not located any individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only remaining population (containing no more than 39 animals) of the Pacific pocket mouse occurs on the Dana Point
Headlands of Dana Point, California. As discussed under factors A, C, and D in the Summary of Factors Affecting the
Species section above, an emergency posing a significant risk to the well-being and continued survival of the Pacific
pocket mouse exists as the result of the imminent, proposed destruction of 3.65 of the 3.75 acres of occupied habitat
(Brylski 1993; EDAW 1993a,b). The Pacific pocket mouse is also imminently threatened at this location by feral and/or
domestic cat depredation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the Service finds that the Pacific pocket mouse is in imminent danger of extinction throughout
all or a significant portion of its range and warrants immediate protection under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical habitat, as defined by section 3(5)(A) of the Act, means: (i) The specific areas within the geographical
area occupied by a species, at the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those physical or biological
features (I) essential to the conservation of the species, and (II) that may require special management considerations
or protection, and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by a species at the time it is listed,
upon a determination that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that critical habitat be designated to the maximum extent prudent and determinable
concurrently with the determination that a species is endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations (50 CFR
424.12(a)(1)) state that a designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations
exist: (1) The species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can
be expected to increase the degree of such threat to the species, or (2) such designation of critical habitat would
not be beneficial to the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent at this time for the Pacific pocket mouse. The
only known population of this species is found on private lands where Federal jurisdiction or involvement in land-use
activities is not expected. Therefore, the designation of critical habitat within the existing range of the Pacific
pocket mouse would not appreciably benefit the species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition, cooperation with the States, and requires
that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against certain activities are discussed, in part, below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. The Service does not expect
to receive requests for consultation from other Federal agencies with respect to this species because no Federal
involvement is expected for activities occurring within habitat currently occupied by the Pacific pocket mouse.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions
that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to take (including harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or
attempt any such conduct), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial
activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess,
sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply
to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available
for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in connection
with otherwise lawful activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for copies of the regulations on listed wildlife and inquiries regarding same should be addressed to the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to amend its regulations concerning radiation protection requirements.
The proposed rule would: Delete the definition of ``Controlled area'' to make it clear that any area to which access
is restricted for the purpose of radiological protection is a restricted area as defined in the regulation, revise
the definition of ``Occupational dose'' to delete reference to the ``Restricted area,'' revise the definition of
unrestricted area to be consistent with the deletion of controlled area, revise the provision entitled ``Instruction
to Workers,'' so that radiation protection training will be provided to all persons with the potential to be occupationally
exposed and restore a provision to provide that whenever licensees are required to report exposures of individual
members of the public to the NRC, then those individuals are to receive copies of the report.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 21, 1991, (56 FR 23360) the NRC amended 10 CFR part 20 to add its revised ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation
(10 CFR 20.1001&hyph;20.2402). Compliance became mandatory for all licensees on January 1, 1994. Extensive discussion
regarding interpretation and implementation of the new rules has ensued both within the NRC and Agreement State staffs
and with licensees and other interested parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised standards include a definition for the term ``Controlled area.'' The term is defined to be an area outside
of a restricted area, but inside the site boundary access to which can be limited for any reason (10 CFR 20.1003). The
term ``Restricted area'' was retained in the revised standards from the original regulation, 10 CFR part 20, and is
defined as an area, ``access to which is limited by the licensees for the purpose of protecting individuals against
undue risks from exposure to radiation or radioactive materials *&blank;*&blank;* (10 CFR 20.1003).'' Neither
the revised standards themselves, nor the supplemental information provide a basis for deciding whether to designate
a given area as a ``Restricted area'' or a ``Controlled area.'' In discussions with licensees and Agreement States,
the absence of such a clear delineation appears to be the cause of considerable uncertainty among a number of licensees
regarding how to implement the revised standards in this regard. The NRC believes that this situation can be alleviated
by eliminating the term ``Controlled area'' from the regulations. This change has the effect of returning the regulation
to the former situation in which areas are either restricted or unrestricted for purposes of radiation protection.
As has always been the case, licensees continue to have the option of controlling access to areas for reasons other
than radiation protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``Unrestricted area'' in the revised standard acknowledges the existence of controlled areas
and currently is defined as an area ``access to which is neither limited nor controlled by the licensee'' (10 CFR 20.1003).
Deletion of the term ``Controlled area'' permits return to the former situation in which areas are either restricted
or unrestricted for radiation protection purposes, and the Commission now proposes to revise the definition of ``Unrestricted
area'' to make this clear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, licensees would continue to have the option to control access for reasons other than radiation
protection. As before, the definitions of ``restricted area'' and of ``unrestricted area'' do not preclude the existence
of areas in which access is limited for purposes other than protecting individuals against undue risks from exposure
to radiation and/or radioactive materials.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Occupational dose'' is defined currently in the revised standards ``as the dose received by an individual in a restricted
area or in the course of employment in which the individual's assigned duties involve exposure to radiation and/or
to radioactive materials *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (10 CFR 20.1003) Through meetings with licensees to discuss the
revised standards, the Commission has become aware that this definition can be interpreted to allow individuals
who are members of the public to receive an ``occupational dose'' and exceed public dose limits if they enter restricted
areas. This was not the intention of the Commission in promulgating the revised standards. A fundamental principle
present in the regulations is that a member of the public is subject to the limits for a member of the public (&sect;20.1301
(a)(1)), irrespective of that individual's location. The Commission is separately considering revisions to parts
20 and 35, whereby licensees who have been administered radioactive materials to patients and released them in accordance
with &sect;35.75 would be exempt from the provisions of &sect;20.1301 (a)(1) with regard to the radioactive material
in the released patient. Licensees must be able to ensure that a member of the public, if present in a restricted area,
as well as any other area, will not exceed an exposure of 100 mrem/year. The suggestion that permission to expose a member
of the public to a dose in excess of 100 mrem in a year, is created by that individual's location in a restricted area,
can be removed by a simple modification to the definition of occupational dose, specifically by eliminating reference
to dose received in a restricted area. In addition, ``radiation and/or radioactive material'' should replace ``radiation
and radioactive material'' to correct a technical error in the text of the rule. With these changes, it would become
clear that occupational dose is dose received as a result of an individual's employment in which assigned duties involve
exposure to radiation and/or radioactive material. These changes would also make it clear that the dose received
by a member of the public cannot be permitted to exceed the public dose limit even if the individual is receiving a portion
of that dose while in a restricted area. The remainder of the definition of occupational dose would not be modified
by this action, and maintains the description of both what is included and what is excluded in occupational dose for
purposes of clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation entitled ``Instruction to Workers,'' 10 CFR 19.12, currently requires that all individuals working
in or frequenting any portion of a restricted area be instructed in the health protection problems associated with
exposure to radiation and in radiation protection procedures needed to minimize exposure. Under this provision,
if a worker never enters a restricted area, he or she would require no radiation protection training. On the other hand,
members of the public, such as delivery persons who might occasionally enter a restricted area, would be required
to be trained even though the nature of their activities would perhaps not warrant such instruction. The proposed
change to &sect;19.12 would make it clear that anyone in the course of their employment in which the individual's assigned
duties involve the potential for exposure to radiation and/or radioactive material would have to be provided appropriate
radiation protection training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concern about training requirements has been expressed for certain categories of workers and members of the public
illustrated by the following cases: Case (1) involves a member of the public who is potentially exposed to some radiation
while visiting a facility or making deliveries, and, Case (2), a maintenance worker or contractor who is exposed to
radiation while performing repairs or cleaning. In order to decide if training is required, and what type of training
is appropriate, certain provisions of the rules must be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, after January 1, 1994, a member of the public cannot be permitted to receive more than 100 mrem in a year unless
specifically approved by the Commission (10 CFR 20.1301).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Second, training commensurate with the potential radiological health protection problems present would be required
by the proposed 10 CFR 19.12 only for individuals whose assigned duties involve a potential for exposure to radiation
and/or radioactive materials. In the first case above, the individual's activities, i.e., visiting a facility or
making deliveries, were not assigned by the licensee or a licensee contractor. Under these conditions, the individual
is a member of the public, and the licensee must ensure that exposures are less than 100 mrem in a year, and further must
be as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). Doses to these individuals should be controlled by other measures that
would be included in an ALARA program, such as shielding, escorting, removing radioactive sources during visits,
and controlling stay-times. Therefore, the Commission believes training is not required. However, nothing in the
rules prevents providing training to any individuals.

As discussed above, the Commission is separately considering revisions to parts 20 and 35 to address cases whereby
licensees have treated patients with radioactive material and released them under the provisions of &sect;35.75,
and thus would not fall under the provision of &sect;20.1301(a)(1) with regard to the radioactive material in the
released patient.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the second case, the individual's activities, i.e., performing repairs or cleaning, are performed during the
course of employment with the licensee or a contractor to the licensee and the individuals' assigned duties do involve
the potential for exposure to radiation. Although the individual may not enter a restricted area and, whether this
worker's dose exceeds 100 mrem in a year or not, if the worker has the potential to receive some occupational exposure,
training ``commensurate with potential radiological health protection problems present in the workplace'' is
required to ensure informed consent and control of exposure. This training does not have to be extensive. The Commission
believes that doses received by individual workers at a rate greater than the 1mSv (100 mrem) in a year public dose limit
constitute a level of risk which requires training at least to a level which provides information on the risks of exposure
and methods for reducing exposure in keeping with the ALARA principle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the promulgation of the revised standards, paragraph 20.409(b) of part 20 provided that whenever a licensee
is required to report to the Commission any exposure of an identified individual worker or member of the public to radiation
and/or radioactive material, the licensee must also notify that individual.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although it was the intent of the Commission that this provision remain in 10 CFR part 20, the requirement was inadvertently
omitted from the revised standards. Accordingly, &sect;20.2205 is added to clearly restore to 10 CFR part 20 the intention
that individual workers and individual members of the public are to be notified of exposures in excess of the dose limits
that would require notifying the NRC. Under &sect;20.2205, the licensees' obligation to notify an individual will
be triggered if (and only if) the licensee's required report to NRC identifies that individual by name as having received
an exposure to radiation and/or to radioactive material. The licensee's obligation to identify individuals in a
required report to the NRC is as provided for in 10 CFR 20.2203.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would apply to all NRC licensees and Agreement States (Definitions in 10 CFR part 20 are Division
I matters and are thus matters of compatibility). The proposed changes, with the exception of the addition of &sect;20.2205
and the revision of the definition of unrestricted area, were discussed in June 1993 with Agreement State representatives
and the changes discussed were strongly supported. Agreement States have the opportunity to comment further on all
of the proposed changes during the public comment period. The Agreement States cannot be expected to modify their
regulations before the January 1, 1994, date. Some States will need as much as 3 years to conform to the changes. In the
interim, States may wish to consider alternative methods to address the issues presented in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft of the proposed amendments, with the exception of the addition of &sect;20.2205 and the revision of the definition
of unrestricted area, was provided to the Agreement States prior to submitting the amendments for publication in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several States submitted comments. One State suggested limiting public doses to ``licensed'' sources of radiation
while another observed that keeping this provision general permitted the States to control exposure from Naturally
Occurring and Accelerator Produced Radioactive Material (NARM) as well as byproduct material. The proposed rule
is general and does not specify licensed sources. This approach is consistent with the rule, as expressed in &sect;20.1001
to control doses from all sources of radiation that are under the control of the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another State provided a revised definition of ``Member of the Public'' which would not rely on the definition of ``Occupational
dose'' and would make clear that workers exposed to NARM are not members of the public. The intent here was to minimize
the change to the definitions and still accomplish the needed clarifications of these issues. For that reason and
because ``Occupational dose'' is defined as from ``licensed or unlicensed'' sources, this change is not made in the
proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two States argued that the draft language restricting the training requirements in 10 CFR 19.12 to individuals involved
``in licensed activities'' and ``in the licensee's facility'' was too restrictive, and might prevent workers such
as housekeeping staff and security staff from receiving minimal, but needed training. The language of the training
requirement is more inclusive in this proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One State proposed retaining in &sect;20.2104(a) a requirement to determine prior occupational dose if an individual
enters the restricted area. The NRC staff believes that retaining only the words ``is likely to receive, in a year,
an occupational dose requiring monitoring,'' is sufficient to trigger a determination of prior dose. The State also
suggested wording which would make licensees responsible for accounting for occupational exposure from nonlicensed
activities. This is consistent with the Commission's position and the draft is revised accordingly.

Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provision in 10 CFR Part 20 for a ``Controlled area,'' its definition and its use in several other sections of Part
20 would be deleted. Licensees would continue to have the option to control access to areas for reasons other than radiation
protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rulemaking would revise the definition of ``Occupational dose'' to delete reference to the ``Restricted
area'' so that the occupational dose limit and its associated radiation protection provisions, such as training
and individual monitoring requirements, would apply to an individual who in the course of employment has assigned
duties involving exposure to radiation and/or to radioactive material. This change would also indicate that public
dose limits cannot be exceeded for members of the public even if they enter a restricted area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``Unrestricted area'' would be revised to make it clear that for the purposes of radiation protection
areas, are either restricted or unrestricted and that access to unrestricted areas can be controlled for reasons
other than radiation protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Instructions to Workers,'' 10 CFR 19.12, would be revised to make clear that training commensurate with the hazards
present must be provided to all individuals who have the potential to be occupationally exposed rather than just to
individuals working in or frequenting any portion of a restricted area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Reports to individuals of exceeding dose limits,'' 10 CFR 20.2205, is added to restore to part 20 the Commission's
intent that any identified individual, including members of the public, who receives an exposure in excess of the
dose limits for which a report to the NRC is required, will receive notification of that exposure from the licensee.

Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that these proposed changes will have some, albeit relatively minor, impacts on licensees.
The impacts associated with each of the changes are outlined below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the deletion of the definition of controlled area, the Commission believes that there will be little impact on
most power reactor licensees. Although some confusion has surfaced associated with the intent of the terms ``controlled
area'' and ``occupational dose,'' these definitions have been discussed extensively with and by industry representatives,
and the Commission believes that the proposed rule generally reflects current and planned practices of many reactor
licensees. Licensees can continue to designate areas as controlled areas for purposes other than radiological protection,
irrespective of whether the term appears in the rule or not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some licensees have already implemented the revised standards, and procedures have been written which would require
changes as a result of this proposed rulemaking if these procedures have employed the concept of controlling areas
for radiological protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those reactor licensees who have already formally implemented the revised standards or who have a need for the
additional flexibility afforded by the use of the concept of controlled area for purposes of radiological protection,
the provisions for exemptions from the NRC's regulations provides an avenue of relief. The NRC currently believes
that the elimination of the concept of ``Controlled area'' will have such a small impact on most power reactor licensees
that it does not constitute a backfit as envisioned by 10 CFR 50.109. The action removes flexibility but does not directly
impose new procedures. However, the NRC welcomes comments on whether this action does in fact constitute a backfit,
the degree of burden imposed by the action, particularly for licensees who have already implemented the revised standards,
and on whether in the limited matter of ``Controlled area,'' provisions for grandfathering should be provided in
the final rule to avoid such burdens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the definition of ``Unrestricted area'' further makes clear the NRC's intent that for purposes of radiation
protection, areas are either restricted or unrestricted. Some minor modifications to procedures and training may
be necessitated by this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the change involving the term occupational exposure, the Commission believes that some minor editorial modifications
of procedures and training will be necessary. Occupational exposure was previously defined to include both presence
in a restricted area and activities involving exposure to radiation and/or radioactive materials. Elimination
of the reference to restricted areas will not change the scope of applicability of the term occupational dose for most
licensees' employees. Furthermore, this change as it relates to doses to members of the public, makes it clear that
doses to members of the public must remain within the limits for members of the public, even if they are present within
a restricted area. This distinction may result in some minor corrections to procedures and administrative control
levels. However, it should be noted that licensees have controlled and continue to control the exposure of these individuals
to small fractions of the public dose limit. Thus, there should be no significant change necessary in licensee activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conforming change to 10 CFR part 19 is minor and will affect only a small number of licensees and will have a negligible
impact. For the modification of the training requirements to match the definition of occupational exposure, the
Commission believes that licensees will need to make relatively minor modifications to training procedures to reflect
the new definition. Training remains ``commensurate with potential radiological health protection problems''
and, thus, the scope of the training activities is not anticipated to require modification. The Commission also believes
that any small incremental increase in burden of additional occupationally exposed individuals requiring training
will be offset by the reduction in burden inherent in the fact that members of the public entering a restricted area
will no longer be required to be trained in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR part 19.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The addition to 10 CFR part 20 of a requirement to notify individual workers and individual members of the public of
exposures in excess of the dose limits is not considered to impose any additional burden on licensees.

 The addition would make clear in 10 CFR part 20, where such a requirement would normally be expected, that when existing
reporting requirements would result in reporting exposure information on an identified individual member of the
public to NRC, then the identified individual would receive a report on his or her exposure.

The impact of these proposed rule changes on materials licensees is considered to be minimal. The NRC believes that
these changes will provide additional clarity when implementing the revised 10 CFR part 20 and will not have an adverse
impact on the health and safety of workers or the public. Removing the implied option to establish controlled areas
for radiation protection purposes, and simplifying the definition and administration of occupational dose will
require minimal changes in procedures and in some cases may even involve a net reduction in burden. Licensees continue
to have the option to control access to areas for reasons other than radiological protection. Licensees who have already
written procedures including provisions for controlled areas for radiation protection purposes would have the
option to request exemptions. Materials licensees, particularly those who have already implemented the new regulations,
are invited to comment on whether or not the proposed changes impose significant burden.

Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations
in subpart A of 10 CFR part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment and therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The option of establishing access control over an area owned by a licensee for reasons of security, for example, exists
whether or not the term ``Controlled area'' is specifically defined in 10 CFR part 20. The provision for controlled
areas in the rule is not a requirement. Deleting the term ``Controlled area'' from the rule is not expected to result
in a significant change in the number of areas to be controlled or in an increase in exposure to any member of the public.
Public access to licensee owned facilities and land is expected to remain unchanged as a result of this amendment.
No other environmental impact or benefit is associated with the ``Controlled area'' provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the definition of ``Occupational dose'' to make it clear that individuals whose assigned duties involve
exposure to radiation and radioactivity are subject to radiation protection procedures associated with occupational
exposure and that members of the public cannot be permitted to receive doses that exceed public dose limits just by
entering a restricted area is considered a benefit with no environmental impact. This change would have no effect
on the type or quantity of material released into the environment and, if anything, would make it less likely for members
of the public to be exposed to more than public dose limits.

Revising the definition of ``Unrestricted area'' to make it clear that for purposes of radiation protection, areas
are either restricted or unrestricted, has no perceived environmental impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amending the radiation protection training requirements to clarify that they apply to individuals who in the course
of employment are potentially exposed to radiation and/or to radioactive material, regardless of whether they may
or may not be within a restricted area, will result in no impact on the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adding &sect;20.2205 to part 20, which would clearly restore the Commission's policy that individual workers and
individual members of the public are notified, whenever NRC is notified, that they have been exposed to radiation
or radioactive material in excess of the dose limits, will have no impact on the environment.

Regulatory Flexibility Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the information available at this stage of the rulemaking proceeding and in accordance with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the NRC certifies that, if promulgated, this rule will not have a significant economic
impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The proposed amendments would apply to all NRC and Agreement State
licensees. Because these amendments only clarify, restore, and conform existing requirements to the 1991 version
of part 20, they are considered to have no significant economic impact on any large or small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the NRC is seeking comments and suggested modifications because of the widely differing conditions under
which small licensees operate. Any small entity subject to this proposed regulation which determines that, because
of its size, it is likely to bear a disproportionate adverse economic impact should notify the NRC of this in a comment
that indicates_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The licensee's size in terms of annual income or revenue, number of employees and, if the licensee is a treatment
center, the number of beds and patients treated annually; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) How the proposed regulation would result in a significant economic burden upon the licensee as compared to that
on a larger licensee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) How the proposed regulations could be modified to take into account the licensee's differing needs or capabilities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The benefits that would be gained or the detriments that would be avoided by the licensee if the proposed regulation
was modified as suggested by the commenter; and

Backfit Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because 10 CFR parts 19 and 20 apply to all NRC licensees, any proposed changes to these parts must be evaluated to determine
if these changes constitute backfitting for reactor licensees such that the provisions of 10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,''
apply. The following discussion addresses that evaluation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule consists of five changes: (1) Deletion of the definition and use of the term ``Controlled area,''
(2) deletion of the phrase ``in a restricted area or'' contained in the definition of occupational dose, (3) revising
the definition of ``Unrestricted area,'' (4) modification of the training requirement contained in 10 CFR 19.12,
and (5) restoring a requirement that individuals members of the public be notified when they are identified in reports
to NRC on exposures in excess of the limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deletion of the definition of controlled area is a corrective change. The term was originally added with the 1991
revision of part 20 to acknowledge the need for licensees to control access to areas for purposes other than radiation
protection. The use of the term was not intended to be mandatory. Numerous questions from licensees regarding implementing
Controlled areas have arisen. Since the staff believes that the use of a controlled area has no radiation protection
function other than potential use in estimating the occupancy time for demonstrating compliance with the 100 mrem/year
limit, it is being proposed that the term be deleted from part 20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those reactor licensees who have already formally implemented the revised standards or who have a need for the
additional flexibility afforded by the use of the concept of controlled area for purposes of radiological protection,
the provisions for exemptions from the NRC's regulations provide an avenue of relief. The NRC currently believes
that the elimination of the concept of ``Controlled area'' will have such a small impact on most power reactor licensees
that it does not constitute a backfit as envisioned by 10 CFR 50.109. The action removes flexibility but does not directly
impose new procedures. However, the NRC welcomes comments on whether this action does in fact constitute a backfit,
the degree of burden imposed by the action, particularly for licensees who have already implemented the revised 10
CFR part 20, and on whether in the limited matter of ``Controlled area'' provisions for grandfathering should be provided
in the final rule to avoid such burdens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deletion of the phrase ``in a restricted area or,'' contained in the definition of occupational dose is to ensure
that the Commission's intent to apply the dose limits of 10 CFR 20.1301 to members of the public regardless of their
physical location, is properly implemented. Currently, only workers are subject to the higher occupational dose
limits and just because a member of the public is permitted entry into a restricted area does not mean that he or she should
be allowed to receive an occupational dose and exceed the public dose limit. For this reason, the reference to a restricted
area is being removed from the definition of occupational dose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the definition of ``Unrestricted area,'' would make the current staff position clear that for purposes
of radiation protection, areas are either restricted or unrestricted. This change is consistent with the former
10 CFR part 20 and conforms to removing ``Controlled area'' from the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change to 10 CFR 19.12 will be consistent with the proposed revised definition of occupational exposure. Since
occupational dose is to be based upon the individual's activities involving radiation and/or radioactive materials,
rather than the location of the work (e.g., restricted area), a conforming change in part 19 is needed to ensure that
workers who receive an occupational dose are appropriately trained regardless of the physical location where the
work is performed. This is also needed so that members of the public, such as delivery persons, who occasionally enter
a restricted area will not be required to receive occupational training merely because they entered a restricted
area when their potential exposures do not exceed the 1 Msv (100 mrem) public dose limit and their activities, therefore,
would not subject them to any significant risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff believes that the impact of the change to 10 CFR 19.12 is negligible for 10 CFR part 50 licensees, given
that the expected numbers of additional occupationally exposed individuals requiring training is small relative
to the number of workers already receiving training at these facilities. The NRC staff also believes that these licensees
have been providing training to these individuals, even though not specifically required by the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of 10 CFR 20.2205, ``Reports to individuals of exceeding dose limits'' is considered to be the restoration
of a previous requirement. Section 20.409(b) of part 20 requires licensees to notify an individual worker or member
of the public whenever a report to the NRC is required regarding an exposure of the identified individual. This requirement
was inadvertently omitted from the revised standards. Although few incidents occur that involved exposure of a member
of the public in excess of dose limits, restoring this provision to part 20 will ensure that licensees are aware of their
obligation to notify the individual if, and when, they are required to submit a report to NRC of an occurrence that identifies
that individual as having received an exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that these proposed changes to 10 CFR part 20 will have some, albeit minor, impacts on reactor
licensees. Licensees who have already implemented the revised standards, or who have written procedures to do so,
will need to revise those procedures to reflect the proposed changes if promulgated. Benefits such as simplifying
the use of restricted and unrestricted area designation, making it clear that only workers can receive occupational
dose, tying training requirements to the potential to receive occupational exposure and ensuring that overexposed
individuals are notified, are considered by the Commission to far outweigh the impacts. However, these benefits
are qualitative in nature, and are expressed in terms of reduced uncertainty in regulatory requirements, clarity
of regulatory intent, and consistency of regulatory approach. Thus the NRC believes that the modifications proposed
are not backfits. However, the NRC invites comments from affected licensees on whether these proposed changes impose
significant burdens and whether or not the actions constitute a backfit.

The agencies believe that additional time for comment is warranted due to the magnitude of the proposed changes, the
complexity of the issues, the level of interest in the subject, and delays posed by the holiday season. The agencies
are nonetheless pleased with the volume of comment received to date and believe that further comment will contribute
measurably to improvements in the final rule. Therefore, the agencies have determined that it is appropriate to extend
the comment period for an additional 30 days. This additional time should allow commenters adequate time fully to
analyze and to respond to the proposal.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing
Model 747 series airplanes, that currently requires inspecting to detect cracking in certain lower lobe lap joints,
and repair, if necessary; reporting any findings of discrepancies; replacing certain countersunk fasteners with
protruding head fasteners; and verifying that the airplanes do not have certain countersunk fasteners. This action
would increase the area to be inspected, delete the reporting requirement, and expand the applicability. This proposal
is prompted by reports of fuselage skin cracking in certain areas and findings of additional countersunk fasteners.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent reduced structural integrity of the fuselage.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 19, 1989, the FAA issued AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;6440 (55 FR 255, January 4, 1990),
applicable to Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, having line numbers 201 through 765, inclusive, to require: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Repetitively inspecting to detect cracking in certain lower lobe lap joints, and repair, if necessary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Reporting any findings of discrepancies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Replacing certain countersunk fasteners with protruding head fasteners; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Verifying that airplanes do not have certain countersunk fasteners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That action was prompted by reports of cracking in the lap joint of stringer 34 near the interface with the wing-to-body
fairing. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent in-flight depressurization due to undetected cracks
in the skin of the airplane.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received additional reports of cracking in the upper row of countersunk fasteners
in the lap splice in the area adjacent to the wing-to-body fairing intersection on Model 747 series airplanes. Additionally,
several airplanes were found to have more than the necessary number of countersunk fasteners, which were installed
during production at the upper row of the lap splice at stringer 34. These countersunk fasteners were found in the upper
row of fasteners in the lap splice near the wing-to-body fairing and skin intersection between body station (BS) 768
and the circumferential skin joint at BS 741. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cracking in locations where countersunk fasteners were installed, if not corrected, could result in reduced structural
integrity of the fuselage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
747&hyph;53A2312, Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992, that describes procedures for visually inspecting to determine
the number of countersunk fasteners in the upper row of the lap splice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If more than the necessary number of countersunk fasteners were installed during production, this service bulletin
specifies conducting an external high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection to detect cracking in the skin lap
splices at the wing-to-body fairing intersection where countersunk fasteners were found in the upper row of fasteners.
If cracking is found, the service bulletin describes procedures for modifying the locations where countersunk fasteners
were found by replacing the countersunk fasteners with oversized protruding head fasteners and repairing the skin.
These actions were accomplished, prior to delivery, on airplanes having line numbers 815 through 919, inclusive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the proper number of countersunk fasteners were installed during production, repetitive inspections are specified
in the service bulletin until the locations where countersunk fasteners were installed have been modified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The service bulletin describes procedures for eventual modification of all airplanes at the location where countersunk
fasteners were installed, and repetitive inspections following modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07 to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Continue to require inspections to detect cracking in certain lower lobe lap joints, and repair, if necessary;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Require visual inspections to determine if countersunk fasteners had been installed between body stations (BS)
741 and 1000 at Stringers (S&hyph;)34L, S&hyph;34R, S&hyph;39L, S&hyph;39R, and S&hyph;44L, S&hyph;44R, and between
BS 1480 and 1741 at S&hyph;34L, S&hyph;34R, S&hyph;40L, and S&hyph;40R on airplanes having line numbers 201 through
814, inclusive; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Require HFEC inspections to detect cracking at all locations where countersunk fasteners were found in the upper
row of the lap splice, and repair, if necessary; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Require modification of all locations where countersunk fasteners were found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the actions and compliance times of this proposed AD would differ from the manufacturer's recommendations
specified in the service bulletin, the actions themselves would be required to be accomplished in accordance with
the procedures of the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 723 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 183 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspections that were previously required by AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07, and retained in this AD, take approximately
14 workhours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of these inspection requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,910 or $770 per airplane,
per inspection cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional new inspections that would be required by this AD would take approximately 82 work hours per airplane
to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these inspection
requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $825,330, or $4,510 per airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modification required by this AD would take approximately 124 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average
labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the modification requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,248,060, or $6,820 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of the inspection and modification requirements of this AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $2,214,300, or $11,407 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator
has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the proposed modification would require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However,
the 20,000-flight cycle compliance time specified in paragraph (j) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for
the modification of all locations where countersunk fasteners were found to be accomplished coincidentally with
scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with
special airplane scheduling.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is inviting comments on whether it should revise its regulations
governing the assessment of annual charges for the administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act and if so, what
changes might be appropriate. One alternative that the Commission is considering is to allocate the annual charges
for administrative costs among a single class of licensees and exemptees, based on the respective capacity of each
hydropower project as measured in kilowatts, with a minimum and maximum charge, and with the assessments to commence
at the same time as the commencement of project construction. To ameliorate the potential impact on licensees and
exemptees, this alternative would include a transition period of several years for phasing-in the changes. Other
alternatives would include, but would not be limited to, retention of the current distinction between municipal
and non-municipal licensees including retention of the different formulae by which their respective annual charges
are allocated.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) invites comments on whether it should revise its regulations
governing the assessment of annual charges for the administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act (FPA),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and if so, what changes might be appropriate. One alternative that the Commission is considering is to allocate the
annual charges for administrative costs among a single class of licensees and exemptees, based on the respective
capacity of each hydropower project as measured in kilowatts, with a minimum and maximum charge, and with the assessments
to commence at the same time as the commencement of project construction. To ameliorate the potential impact on licensees
and exemptees, this alternative would include a transition period of several years for phasing-in the changes. Other
alternatives would include, but would not be limited to, retention of the current distinction between municipal
and non-municipal licensees including retention of the different formulae by which their respective annual charges
are allocated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current regulations, major non-municipal licensees file annual reports containing data on their electric

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing &sect;11.1 provides three different allocation formulae for three different classes of licensees.
For non-municipal licensees of projects of more than 2,000 horsepower of installed capacity, &sect;11.1(a) sets
forth an allocation formula that is based on a combination of the project's authorized installed capacity and the
energy actually generated.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For municipal licensees of projects of more than 2,000 horsepower, &sect;11.1(b) sets forth an allocation formula
based solely on capacity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the process of collecting data and assessing charges could be conducted more efficiently
if the allocation were based on a single formula, and questions whether any presently-valid purpose is served by perpetuating
the divergent formulae. Therefore, one alternative the Commission is considering is to use the same formula to allocate
the annual charges among a single pool of licensees that includes both municipal licensees (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, those who are not fully exempt from annual charges) and non-municipal licensees, as well as minor licensees and (as
discussed below) exemptees. One variation of that alternative is to base that formula entirely on authorized installed
capacity. Another variation would be to base the formula entirely on generation. A third alternative would be to base
it on a combination of capacity and generation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We recognize that using the same formula to allocate the annual charges among a single pool of licensees (and exemptees)
would cause a large increase, both in total dollars and percentage, that major municipal licensees as a group experience.
We solicit comment on this impact. One approach the Commission could consider (discussed below) would be the adoption
of a three-year transition period for phasing in the resulting cost changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the allocation formula from a mix of capacity and generation to capacity alone would reduce the Commission's
administrative burden as well as the reporting requirements of major non-municipal licensees. Under the current
system, the Commission obtains annual generation data from non-municipal project operators; delays in providing
this information to the Commission complicate the billing process. By using authorized installed capacity exclusively,
the Commission would always have the apportionment data on hand and the calculation of the bills would be simplified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also considering alternative formulae, such as an allocation based in whole or in part on generation
measured in kilowatt hours. In this regard, the Commission notes that the annual charges it assesses pursuant to OBRA
are all allocated among the regulated entities pursuant to a formula based on an appropriate measure of volume rather
than on a measure of capacity. OBRA requires the Commission to compute those annual charges based on methods which
the Commission determines to be ``fair and equitable.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the annual charges for the administration of part I of the FPA pursuant to section 10(e)(1) of the FPA,
the analog to allocation of the annual charges pursuant to OBRA would be an allocation scheme based on the electric
energy actually generated by the various licensed and exempted hydropower projects rather than on their respective
capacity to so generate. We are concerned, however, that the generation data reporting requirements necessary to
implement such a scheme may impose an undue burden on smaller licensees and exemptees. Accordingly, the Commission
invites comment on the propriety of using generation data rather than authorized capacity as the basis for allocating
the charges, and on whether such a scheme would be unduly burdensome on some or all licensees or exemptees. We specifically
invite comment from municipal and minor licensees as to whether they have equipment for measuring generation and
whether it would be burdensome to report such data to us. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative that the Commission is considering to simplify the allocation process is to eliminate only the
third prong of the formula, and to include minor licensees in the respective allocation formulae for major licensees.
In other words, the minor municipal licensees would be included in the same allocation formula with the major municipal
licensees, and the minor non-municipal licensees would be included in the same allocation formula with the major
non-municipal licensees. The Commission could include exemptees in the same manner. This alternative would preserve
the existing use of a formula based on a combination of capacity and generation to determine the annual charges for
non-municipal licensees, and of a formula based solely on capacity to determine the annual charges for municipal
licensees. This alternative would avoid the large increase, both in total dollars and percentage, that major municipal
licensees as a group would experience under a single, unified formula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission could provide a transition period for phasing in the assessments for minor licensees and exemptees.
The Commission specifically invites comment from minor licensees and exemptees on whether such a transition period
would be helpful or appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this regard, the Commission notes that the current system of categorizing municipal and non-municipal projects
separately for purposes of annual charges produces a sizeable disparity in the annual charges assessed for projects
of comparable size depending on their class of ownership. The disparity is illustrated by the data in the table in Appendix
A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the present regulations, and under the currently prevailing facts (which, as discussed below, can be expected
to change), the non-municipal licensees are assessed a substantially larger annual charge per kilowatt of capacity
than the municipal licensees. This is occurring primarily because the bulk of the Commission's current licensing
activities is focused on processing applications for new licenses for projects whose original licensees expired
in 1993. Since a disproportionate number of these projects are owned by non-municipal licensees, the effect of segregating
out the hours spent on those applications is to allocate more of the annual charges burden to the non-municipal licensees.
In other words, non-municipal licensees as a group are paying comparatively higher annual charges today than municipal
licensees because at this time the non-municipal licensees, as a group, are imposing comparatively greater regulatory
costs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is not to suggest, however, that the disproportionate charges are being assessed only to the non-municipal licensees
who have filed pending applications for a new license or who are presently involved in compliance proceedings. To
the contrary, the annual charge assessments for this work are allocated among all of the non-municipal licensees
as a class, and most of those licensees are neither seeking a new license nor involved in a compliance proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that in some future year the shoe may shift to the other foot. On average, over
time, the licenses for municipal projects expire at the same frequency as the licenses for non-municipal projects,
and the frequency of compliance proceedings also tends to even out. Thus, given the current concentration of resources
on processing cases involving non-municipal projects, it is reasonable to assume that eventually some years will
occur in which there will be an equally disproportionate burden of annual charge assessments on municipal projects
vis-a-vis non-municipal projects. The net effect of the present categorization of costs according to the municipal/non-municipal
status of the project, therefore, is not to permanently favor either one class or the other, but to create swings_both
up and down_in the annual charges assessed to the two classes, depending on the particular mix of the Commission's
workload in any given year. The Commission welcomes comment on all of these matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes the possibility that the elimination of generation as a factor might have a significant
impact on some licensees, and welcomes comment on it. The Commission also recognizes that the charges for minor licensees
may increase substantially, but believes that the current charge of five cents per horsepower has been so heavily
eroded by inflation since it was adopted in 1963 as to have been rendered comparatively meaningless.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, the table in Appendix A at the end of this NOPR shows the following illustrative examples of increases
in annual charges for minor licensees from the 1993 charge to the charge that would result from the amendments described
in the Alternative A regulatory text:

In particular, the Commission welcomes comment on whether there are distinctions between municipal and non-municipal
projects that would justify the current difference in their allocation formulae or whether the substantial increases
in some licensees' annual charges that would result from eliminating this distinction are reason enough to retain
the distinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that, in the case of major construction projects, the license may be in effect for several
years before project construction is commenced and before the project commences operation and goes into service.
With respect to non-municipal licensees, annual charges are payable each year from the date of issuance of the license
but there is no incoming stream of revenue during those years because no power is being generated. Municipal licensees,
on the other hand, do obtain an exemption from annual charges prior to and during the construction period because,
since they are not generating power during that period, they are not selling power for profit. This is because &sect;11.6(g)
of the regulations provides a complete exemption from certain annual charges when a municipal project is under construction
and not generating power, on the theory that the project is operating without profit within the meaning of the municipal
exemption in FPA section 10(e).

Under the various regulatory regimes discussed herein, the Commission would maintain the above-described exemption
from annual charges with respect to municipal projects that have not yet commenced commercial operation. In addition,
the Commission proposes to include in the assessment formula (whatever it may be) only licensed and exempted projects
that have already been constructed or whose construction has commenced. Although framed in terms of all projects,
as a practical matter, because of the exemption for municipal projects, the change would primarily affect non-municipal
projects.

We believe that commencement of construction is a more appropriate determinant than completion of construction,
for two reasons. First of all, the date on which construction commenced is a legally precise, documented date
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15&hyph;16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 whereas the date on which construction is completed is not defined with the same precision. Secondly, it is our understanding
that licensees of projects under construction can draw on construction loan funds to pay the annual charges whereas
such funds may not be available prior to the commencement of construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

15&hyph;16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the FPA requires that the licensee commence construction of the project within fixed time periods after
issuance of the license, as specified in section 13 and the license. Thus, the Commission has evolved standards for
determining the precise date of commencement of construction, and the hydropower industry is familiar with those
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also proposes to establish a minimum and maximum annual charge. The minimum annual charge would be
$100.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe that $100 is a reasonable charge for a regulated project to pay, to participate in defraying the cost of administration
of the hydropower regulatory program, regardless of how small the project's capacity may be.

In the event that a municipal licensee was entitled to a partial exemption from annual charges, the exemption could
reduce its charge below the $100 minimum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also proposes to set a limit on annual charges so that, with respect to costs incurred by the Commission,
no licensee's project would be required to pay more than 2.0 percent of the total costs. We believe that a maximum charge
is appropriate to avoid having a small number of projects bearing most of the Commission's costs of administration.
The proposed limit is modelled after the formula in &sect;382.203(b) with respect to annual charges for oil pipelines.
The maximum annual charge stated therein is 6.339 percent of the total charges, but that figure is based on a much smaller
number of significant entities (interstate oil pipelines) sharing a much smaller total cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to a minimum charge, other alternatives would be to waive charges below a fixed dollar amount or below
a fixed capacity. With respect to a maximum charge, different percentages could be used for the ceiling. If the formula
were to be based solely on capacity, another alternative would be to have a 50 percent discount for all authorized capacity
above a prescribed ceiling (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 500 megawatts). In this example, if a project had an authorized capacity of 1000 megawatts, it would be counted in the
apportionment formula as 750 megawatts (all of the first 500 megawatts plus half of the second 500 megawatts). The
Commission invites comments on these and other potential alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that adoption of some of the alternatives discussed herein might increase the annual charges
for certain pumped storage projects. Nevertheless there are other features (such as the start-of-construction
date and the maximum charge) that would benefit some pumped storage projects, to the extent that large pumped storage
projects have extended design and construction periods and comparatively massive capacity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have included in this notice of proposed rulemaking two alternative examples of the regulatory text that might
be used to implement the various alternative proposals discussed herein. The ``Alternative A'' regulatory text
is based on the allocation of all of the annual charges among a single class of licensees and exemptees, including all
major and minor municipal and non-municipal licensees and all exemptees. The allocation is based solely on the respective
capacity of each hydropower project as measured in kilowatts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Alternative B'' regulatory text retains the current separate categories and formulae for major municipal
and non-municipal licensees. Minor licensees and exemptees would be classified with the comparable groups of major
licensees and their charges would be assessed pursuant to the formulae currently used for those groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the ``Alternative A'' and ``Alternative B'' regulatory texts implement a minimum charge of $100 and a maximum
charge of two percent of the total of all charges. Under both alternatives, assessments would not commence prior to
the commencement of project construction.

B. Transition Arrangements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Commission believes that many of the regulatory amendments discussed above would in the long run render
the regulations more rational and more fair and equitable, the Commission also recognizes that if these amendments
were to be adopted en masse at a single stroke they might impose significant unanticipated burdens on some licensees
and exemptees. Therefore, the Commission proposes a three-year transition period for phasing-in some of the changes
it might adopt, particularly with respect to the changes described in the ``Alternative A'' regulatory text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Charges during the transition described therein would be calculated by the following steps. First, the difference
between a project's charge using the current method and the proposed method would be divided into fourths. The charge
for the first transition year would be the current method charge plus the one-fourth increment. (If the charge is reduced
in going from the current method to the proposed method, the one-fourth increment would be subtracted.)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The charge for the second transition year would be the current method charge plus (or minus) the two-fourths increment.
The charge for the third transition year would be the current method charge plus (or minus) the three-fourths increment.
The charge for the fourth year would be calculated solely by the proposed method.

In order to avoid any net increase or decrease in the total of all charges assessed in any single year, the total amount
of the reductions in the charges must be matched by an equal amount of ``increases'' in charges. The ``increases,''
however, would in fact simply be a partial elimination of a reduction that would otherwise occur_to balance the elimination
of part of an actual increase elsewhere that would otherwise occur.

The charges in all of these transition years, however, would be subject to the proposed minimum and maximum charges.

 In addition, in all of these transition years, charges would be assessed only with respect to hydropower projects
that have been constructed or whose construction has commenced.

percent of the total of all charges assessed. See Appendices A and B for illustrative examples.

The regulatory amendments proposed herein are intended to be purely prospective in nature. Thus, to the extent that
any licensee has obtained approval for an installment or deferred payment plan, the amendments, if adopted, would
not extinguish that licensee's responsibility to pay whatever amounts were assessed under the existing regulations
even if such amounts have been deferred for later payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

a transition period could be established solely for those entities.

C. From Horsepower to Kilowatts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, the existing regulations at &sect;11.1 provide different allocation formulae for municipal
and non-municipal projects of more than 2,000 horsepower of installed capacity. Both formulae, however, take into
account a project's authorized installed capacity defined in terms of horsepower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The computation of a project's capacity in terms of horsepower likely arose in the earlier years of the Commission's
regulatory oversight, when the then-existing projects included a greater percentage of hydromechanical equipment.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Today, however, the determination of a hydroelectric project's authorized capacity is generally stated in terms
of kilowatts; that is the manner in which authorized capacity is stated in the licenses.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 In fact, the Commission's staff determines a project's horsepower capacity by converting kilowatts into horsepower.
Therefore, the Commission proposes to revise &sect;11.1 to substitute kilowatts for horsepower in stating a project's
authorized installed capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In other words, horsepower was a convenient measure for comparing the capacity of hydropower projects, some of which
generated electricity and some which did not. In rough terms, horsepower measures the weight that an average draft
horse can pull in a circular path around a rotary grinder. The common definition in the United States is that one horsepower
is equal to 550 foot-pounds per second or approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
746 watts.

The exception is that the license article on annual charges states the capacity in horsepower.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the few licensed hydromechanical projects, all of which are quite small, the Commission would impute a kilowatt
figure by multiplying these projects' existing horsepower capacity by three-fourths. We believe that using kilowatts
as the standard and converting the few hydromechanical project capacities into an imputed kilowatt capacity is far
easier than converting all of the hydroelectric project capacities from kilowatts to horsepower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. The Determination of Authorized Installed Capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions have occasionally arisen as to how to define ``authorized installed capacity.'' What if the capacity of
the generator exceeds the capacity of the turbine? What if the available stream flow is insufficient to fully utilize
the capacity of the turbine and generator installed in the project?
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
25
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Such situations might arise, for instance, if it were cheaper for a project operator to purchase an ``off-the-shelf''
or a used generator whose capacity exceeded the capacity of the turbine or the stream flow available at the project
site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposes to take this occasion to clarify the concept of ``authorized installed capacity'' by defining
it. The authorized installed capacity would be expressed in kilowatts, and would be the lesser of the capacity of the
generator or the turbine. Thus, if the capacity of the generator exceeded the capacity of the turbine, then the capacity
of the turbine would apply, and vice-versa. The availability of stream flow, however, would not be considered.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would codify the policy articulated in Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County, Washington,
62 FERC &para;61,229 (1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The capacity would be based on the actual power of the equipment in question without regard to whatever ``nameplate''
rating might be physically affixed to the unit (although, with respect to a new or unmodified unit, the ``nameplate
rating'' may well coincide with the definition proposed herein). If the generator or turbine are subsequently modified,
such as by rewinding the generator, the capacity would be recalculated accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the proposed definition provides a means of determining capacity that is both workable and fair. The
capacity of the generator and the turbine are reasonably ascertainable, and do not involve the potential complexities
and controversies inherent in determining the availability of usable stream flow. If a project operator, for whatever
reason, chose to purchase, install or operate equipment whose capacity exceeded the available stream flow needed
to operate it, the operator would have to accept the consequence of having that equipment's capacity used as the basis
for determining the project's annual charges.

certain megawatt limits) which is constructed or operated to generate electric power, if the facility is located

The Commission's staff, however, performs similar safety and environmental compliance functions with respect
to hydroelectric projects that are operated pursuant to a 5 MW or conduit exemption as it does for projects that are
operated pursuant to a license. The Commission also incurs costs in processing exemption applications. Therefore,
as a matter of policy, the Commission believes that it would be appropriate for projects that are operated pursuant
to the 5 MW exemption to share the cost of the Commission's application and compliance programs, and that the same principle
applies as well with respect to conduit exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 10(e) of the FPA provides that ``the licensee shall pay *&blank;*&blank;* annual charges *&blank;*&blank;*
for the costs of the administration of this Part *&blank;*&blank;*'' (emphasis added). We believe that this statutory
language may preclude imposition of annual charges on 5 MW and conduit exemptees under section 10(e) of the FPA. It
is arguable that such exemptees could not be construed as ``licensees'' within the meaning of section 10(e). The Commission
believes, however, that it has the legal authority under OBRA to assess annual charges to exemptees,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Section 3401(a) of OBRA provides as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) In General._(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) and beginning in fiscal year 1987 and in each fiscal year thereafter,
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall, using the provisions of this subtitle and authority provided by
other laws, assess and collect fees and annual charges in any fiscal year in amounts equal to all of the costs incurred
by the Commission in that fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the provisions of this subtitle shall not affect the authority, requirements, exceptions, or limitations in
sections 10(e) and 30(e) of the Federal Power Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas this provision makes clear that OBRA does not authorize the collection of annual charges from, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 municipal licensees who qualify for an exemption under the terms of section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act, projects
under exemptions from licensing are not subject to section 10(e), and therefore charging them under OBRA does not
affect any provision of section 10(e).

Section 30(e) of the Federal Power Act requires the Commission to collect from exemption applicants and certain license
applicants, on behalf of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and state fish

conditions with respect to fish and wildlife resources). These agencies are required to subtract from their section

is $21,620. Because the Commission is proposing to assess annual charges on 5 MW exemptees, the Commission proposes

F. Other Revisions to Annual Charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 11.1(d) currently states that the minimum annual charge for projects involving transmission lines will
be $5. The Commission's current practice, however, is to state that charge in the articles of the individual licenses,
as appropriate. Therefore, we propose to conform the text of &sect;11.1(d) to that practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its current form, &sect;11.20 provides two separate deadlines for payment of bills for annual charges: 30 days
for headwater benefits bills and 45 days for other annual charges bills. The purpose of this distinction is not readily
apparent. Therefore, the Commission proposes to make all such bills payable upon 30 days of their rendition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There has also been some confusion over the procedures that a licensee should follow if it believes that the bill is
incorrect. The proposed new &sect;11.20 provides for licensees to file an appeal of the bill to the Commission's Chief
Financial Officer. All decisions of the Chief Financial Officer on appeals would be subject to rehearing by the Commission
pursuant to &sect;385.713. This would essentially codify the current informal practice. Most billing disputes
involve mathematical calculations that can be readily resolved by discussion with the Commission's staff without
the need for a formal request to the Commission for rehearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bill would still have to be paid within 30 days of its rendition in order to avoid the assessment of penalty payments
under &sect;11.21, but if a timely appeal or request for rehearing is filed the bill could be paid under protest and
subject to refund. This provision would codify the Commission's current practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As currently in effect, &sect;11.6(i) requires that applications for exemptions from payment of annual charges
``shall be prepared on forms prescribed by the Commission *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Inasmuch as the Commission does
not currently prescribe such forms, the reference to such forms will be deleted.

We also propose to add a sentence at the end of &sect;11.6(i) to clarify that bills for annual charges can be paid under
protest and subject to refund in the event that an application for an exemption from payment is pending when the bill
becomes payable. This provision would codify the Commission's current practice.

VII. Information Collection Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) regulations at 5 CFR 1320.13 require that OMB approve certain information
and recordkeeping requirements imposed by an agency. The information collection requirements that would be deleted
by this proposed rule are contained in FERC&hyph;583 ``Annual Kilowatt Generating Report (Annual Charges)'' (1902&hyph;0136).
The Commission's Financial Services Division uses the data for determination of the amount of annual charges to be
assessed licensees for reimbursable government administrative costs. If the amendments proposed herein are adopted,
the Commission would submit to the OMB a notification that these collections of information have been modified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may obtain information on these reporting requirements by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services
Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]. Comments on the requirements of this rule can be sent to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs of OMB [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission].

Authority.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act and section 3401 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986,
the Commission will assess reasonable annual charges against licensees and exemptees to reimburse the United States
for the costs of administration of the Commission's hydropower regulatory program.

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scope.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The annual charges under this section will be charged to and allocated among:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) all licensees; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) all holders of exemptions under section 30 of the Federal Power Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) all holders of exemptions under sections 405 and 408 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended
by section 408 of the Energy Security Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Formula.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A determination shall be made for each fiscal year of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act,
from which shall be deducted administrative costs fixed in the licenses and exemptions and those fixed by the Commission
in determining headwater benefit payments. For each fiscal year, the costs of administration will be assessed against
each licensee and exemptee in the proportion that the annual charge factor for each such project bears to the total
of the annual charge factors under all such outstanding licenses and exemptions. The annual charge factor for each
such project shall be its authorized installed capacity as measured in kilowatts. The assessments will include all
such licensed and exempted projects that have been constructed, and all such licensed and exempted projects whose
construction has been commenced. In the event that construction commences during a fiscal year, the charges will
be prorated based on the day on which construction commenced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Municipal exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) To enable the Commission to compute on the bill for annual charges the exemption to which State and municipal licensees
and exemptees are entitled because of the use of power by the licensee or exemptees for State or municipal purposes,
each such licensee or exemptee must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a statement under
oath showing the following information with respect to the power generated by the project and the disposition thereof
during the preceding fiscal year, expressed in kilowatt-hours: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Gross amount of power generated by the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Amount of power used for station purposes and lost in transmission, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Net amount of power available for sale or use by licensee or exemptee, classified as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Used by licensee or exemptee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Sold by licensee or exemptee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the power from a licensed or exempted project owned by a State or municipality enters into its electric system,
making it impracticable to meet the requirements of this section with respect to the disposition of project power,
such licensee or exemptee may, in lieu thereof, furnish similar information with respect to the disposition of the
available power of the entire electric system of the licensee or exemptee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transmission lines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For projects involving transmission lines only, the administrative charge will be stated in the license. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum and maximum charges.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The minimum annual charge under this section will be $100 per year for each licensed or exempted project, subject
to reduction based on partial or total exemption pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No licensed or exempted project's annual charge may exceed a maximum charge established each year by the Commission
to equal 2.0 percent of the adjusted costs of administration of the hydropower regulatory program. For every project
with an annual charge determined to be above the maximum charge, that project's annual charge will be set at the maximum
charge, and any amount above the maximum charge will be reapportioned to the remaining projects. The reapportionment
will be computed using the method outlined in paragraph (c) of this section (but excluding any project whose annual
charge is already set at the maximum amount). This procedure will be repeated until no project's annual charge exceeds
the maximum charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Commission's costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) With respect to costs incurred by the Commission, the assessment of annual charges will be based on an estimate
of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act that will be incurred during the fiscal year in which
the annual charges are assessed. After the end of the fiscal year, the assessment will be recalculated based on the
costs of administration that were actually incurred during that fiscal year; the actual costs will be compared to
the estimated costs; and the difference between the actual and estimated costs will be carried over as an adjustment
to the assessment for the subsequent fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The issuance of bills based on the administrative costs incurred by the Commission during the year in which the
bill is issued will commence in 1993. The annual charge for the administrative costs that were incurred in fiscal year
1992 will be billed in 1994. At the licensee's option, the charge may be paid in three equal annual installments in fiscal
years 1994, 1995, and 1996, plus any accrued interest. If the licensee elects the three-year installment plan, the
Commission will accrue interest (at the most recent yield of two-year Treasury securities) on the unpaid charges
and add the accrued interest to the installments billed in fiscal years 1995 and 1996.

(h) In making their annual reports to the Commission on their costs in administering Part I of the Federal Power Act,
the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service are to deduct any amounts that
were deposited into their Treasury accounts during that year as reimbursements for conducting studies and reviews
pursuant to section 30(e) of the Federal Power Act.

Definition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

As used in paragraph (c) of this section, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
authorized installed capacity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the lesser of the ratings of the generator or turbine units. The rating of a generator is the product of the continuous-load
capacity rating of the generator in kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and the system power factor in kW/kVA. If the licensee
or exemptee does not know its power factor, a factor of 1.0 kW/kVA will be used. The rating of a turbine is the product
of the turbine's capacity in horsepower (hp) at maximum head gate opening under the manufacturer's rating head times
a conversion factor of 0.75 kW/hp. If the generator or turbine installed has a rating different from that authorized
in the license or exemption, or the installed generator is rewound or otherwise modified to change its rating, or the
turbine is modified to change its rating, the licensee or exemptee must apply to the Commission to amend its authorized
installed capacity to reflect the change.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transition rules. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For a license having the capacity of the project for annual charge purposes stated in horsepower, that capacity
shall be deemed to be the capacity stated in kilowatts elsewhere in the license, including any amendments thereto.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) During the first three fiscal years in which annual charges are assessed after [INSERT DATE ON WHICH THE FINAL RULE
BECOMES EFFECTIVE], the annual charges will be determined as follows. The assessments will include (and be limited
to) all licenses and exempted projects that have been constructed or whose construction has been commenced, and will
be subject to the minimum and maximum charges specified in paragraph (f) of this section. Subject to those parameters,
the Commission will determine the charge that would have been assessed pursuant to the regulations in effect prior
to [INSERT DATE ON WHICH THE FINAL RULE BECOMES EFFECTIVE], the charge that would have been assessed pursuant to the
regulations in effect subsequent to that date, and the difference between those two assessments. In the first fiscal
year after [INSERT DATE ON WHICH THE FINAL RULE BECOMES EFFECTIVE], the Commission will adjust the assessment that
would otherwise be payable under the regulations in effect after that date by an amount equal to 75 percent of the difference
between the amount that would have been payable under the regulations that were previously in effect and the amount
that would have been payable under those regulations after they were amended. In the second fiscal year after [INSERT
DATE ON WHICH THE FINAL RULE BECOMES EFFECTIVE], the Commission will adjust the assessment by 50 percent of that difference.
In the third fiscal year after [INSERT DATE ON WHICH THE FINAL RULE BECOMES EFFECTIVE], the Commission will adjust
the assessment by 25 percent of the difference.

Bases for exemption. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

A State or municipal licensee or exemptee may claim total or partial exemption from the assessment of annual charges
upon one or more of the following grounds: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application for exemption. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications for exemption from payment of annual charges shall be signed by an authorized executive officer or chief
accounting officer of the licensee or exemptee and verified under oath. An original and three copies of such application
shall be filed with the Commission within the time allowed (by &sect;11.28) for the payment of the annual charges.
If the licensee or exemptee, within the time allowed for the payment of the annual charges, files notice that it intends
to file an application for exemption, an additional period of 30 days is allowed within which to complete and file the
application for exemption. The filing of an application for exemption does not by itself alleviate the requirement
to pay the annual charges, nor does it exonerate the licensee or exemptee from the assessment of penalties under &sect;11.21.
If a bill for annual charges becomes payable after an application for an exemption has been filed and while the application
is still pending for decision, the bill may be paid under protest and subject to refund.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Annual charges must be paid no later than 30 days after rendition of a bill by the Commission. If the licensee or exemptee
believes that the bill is incorrect, no later than 30 days after its rendition the licensee or exemptee may file an appeal
of the bill with the Chief Financial Officer. No later than 30 days after the date of issuance of the Chief Financial
Officer's decision on the appeal, the licensee or exemptee may file a request for rehearing of that decision pursuant
to &sect;385.713 of this chapter. In the event that a timely appeal to the Chief Financial Officer or a timely request
to the Commission for rehearing is filed, the payment of the bill may be made under protest, and subject to refund pending
the outcome of the appeal or rehearing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act and section 3401 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986,
the Commission will assess reasonable annual charges against licensees and exemptees to reimburse the United States
for the costs of administration of the Commission's hydropower regulatory program.

Scope.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The annual charges under this section will be charged to and allocated among: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All licensees; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All holders of exemptions under section 30 of the Federal Power Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) All holders of exemptions under sections 405 and 408 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended
by section 408 of the Energy Security Act of 1980. The assessments will include all such licensed and exempted projects
that have been constructed, and all such licensed and exempted projects whose construction has been commenced. In
the event that construction commences during a fiscal year, the charges will be prorated based on the day on which construction
commenced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Licenses and exemptions other than State or municipal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For licensees and exemptees, other than State or municipal: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A determination shall be made for each fiscal year of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act
chargeable to such licensees or exemptees, from which shall be deducted any administrative costs that are stated
in the license or exemption or fixed by the Commission in determining headwater benefit payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For each fiscal year the costs of administration determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be assessed
against such licensee or exemptee in the proportion that the annual charge factor for each such project bears to the
total of the annual charge factors under all such outstanding licenses and exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The annual charge factor for each such project shall be found as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For a conventional project the factor is its authorized installed capacity plus 150 times its annual energy output
in millions of kilowatt-hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For a pure pumped storage project the factor is its authorized installed capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For a mixed conventional-pumped storage project the factor is its authorized installed capacity plus 150 times
its gross annual energy output in millions of kilowatt-hours less 100 times the annual energy used for pumped storage
pumping in millions of kilowatt-hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For purposes of determining their annual charges factor, projects that are operated pursuant to an exemption
or whose authorized installed capacity does not exceed 1.5 megawatts will be deemed to have an annual energy output
of zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To enable the Commission to determine such charges annually, each licensee whose authorized installed capacity
exceeds 1.5 megawatts must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a statement under oath showing
the gross amount of power generated (or produced by nonelectrical equipment) and the amount of power used for pumped
storage pumping by the project during the preceding fiscal year, expressed in kilowatt hours. If any licensee does
not report the gross energy output of its project within the time specified above, the Commission's staff will estimate
the energy output and this estimate may be used in lieu of the filings required by this section made by such licensee
after November 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State and municipal licensees and exemptees.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For State or municipal licensees and exemptees: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A determination shall be made for each fiscal year of the cost of administration under Part I of the Federal Power
Act chargeable to such licensees and exemptees, from which shall be deducted any administrative costs that are stated
in the license or exemption or that are fixed by the Commission in determining headwater benefit payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An exemption will be granted to a licensee or exemptee to the extent, if any, to which it may be entitled under section
10(e) of the Act provided the data is submitted as requested in paragraphs (d) (4) and (5) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For each fiscal year the total actual cost of administration as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section
will be assessed against each such licensee or exemptee (except to the extent of the exemptions granted pursuant to
paragraph (d)(2) of this section) in the proportion that the authorized installed capacity of each such project bears
to the total such capacity under all such outstanding licenses or exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To enable the Commission to compute on the bill for annual charges the exemption to which State and municipal licensees
and exemptees are entitled because of the use of power by the licensee or exemptees for State or municipal purposes,
each such licensee or exemptee must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a statement under
oath showing the following information with respect to the power generated by the project and the disposition thereof
during the preceding fiscal year, expressed in kilowatt-hours: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Gross amount of power generated by the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Amount of power used for station purposes and lost in transmission, etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Net amount of power available for sale or use by licensee or exemptee, classified as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(B) Sold by licensee or exemptee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) When the power from a licensed or exempted project owned by a State or municipality enters into its electric system,
making it impracticable to meet the requirements of this section with respect to the disposition of project power,
such licensee or exemptee may, in lieu thereof, furnish similar information with respect to the disposition of the
available power of the entire electric system of the licensee or exemptee.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum and maximum charges.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The minimum annual charge under this section will be $100 per year for each licensed or exempted project, subject
to reduction based on partial or total exemption pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No licensed or exempted project's annual charge may exceed a maximum charge established each year by the Commission
to equal 2.0 percent of the adjusted costs of administration of the hydropower regulatory program. For every project
with an annual charge determined to be above the maximum charge, that project's annual charge will be set at the maximum
charge, and any amount above the maximum charge will be reapportioned to the remaining projects. The reapportionment
will be computed using the method outlined in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section (but excluding any project whose
annual charge is already set at the maximum amount). This procedure will be repeated until no project's annual charge
exceeds the maximum charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Commission's costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) With respect to costs incurred by the Commission, the assessment of annual charges will be based on an estimate
of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act that will be incurred during the fiscal year in which
the annual charges are assessed. After the end of the fiscal year, the assessment will be recalculated based on the
costs of administration that were actually incurred during that fiscal year; the actual costs will be compared to
the estimated costs; and the difference between the actual and estimated costs will be carried over as an adjustment
to the assessment for the subsequent fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The issuance of bills based on the administrative costs incurred by the Commission during the year in which the
bill is issued will commence in 1993. The annual charge for the administrative costs that were incurred in fiscal year
1992 will be billed in 1994. At the licensee's option, the charge may be paid in three equal annual installments in fiscal
years 1994, 1995, and 1996, plus any accrued interest. If the licensee elects the three-year installment plan, the
Commission will accrue interest (at the most recent yield of two-year Treasury securities) on the unpaid charges
and add the accrued interest to the installments billed in fiscal years 1995 and 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) In making their annual reports to the Commission on their costs in administering Part I of the Federal Power Act,
the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service are to deduct any amounts that
were deposited into their Treasury accounts during that year as reimbursements for conducting studies and reviews
pursuant to section 30(e) of the Federal Power Act.

(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As used in paragraph (c) of this section, ``authorized installed capacity'' means the lesser of the ratings of the
generator or turbine units. The rating of a generator is the product of the continuous-load capacity rating of the
generator in kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and the system power factor in kW/kVA. If the licensee or exemptee does not know
its power factor, a factor of 1.0 kW/kVA will be used. The rating of a turbine is the product of the turbine's capacity
in horsepower (hp) at maximum head gate opening under the manufacturer's rating head times a conversion factor of
0.75 kW/hp. If the generator or turbine installed has a rating different from that authorized in the license or exemption,
or the installed generator is rewound or otherwise modified to change its rating, or the turbine is modified to change
its rating, the licensee or exemptee must apply to the Commission to amend its authorized installed capacity to reflect
the change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(j) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For a license having the capacity of the project for annual charge purposes stated in horsepower, that capacity shall
be deemed to be the capacity stated in kilowatts elsewhere in the license, including any amendments thereto.

Bases for exemption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A State or municipal licensee or exemptee may claim total or partial exemption from the assessment of annual charges
upon one or more of the following grounds: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application for exemption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applications for exemption from payment of annual charges shall be signed by an authorized executive officer or chief
accounting officer of the licensee or exemptee and verified under oath. An original and three copies of such application
shall be filed with the Commission within the time allowed (by &sect;11.28) for the payment of the annual charges.
If the licensee or exemptee, within the time allowed for the payment of the annual charges, files notice that it intends
to file an application for exemption, an additional period of 30 days is allowed within which to complete and file the
application for exemption. The filing of an application for exemption does not by itself alleviate the requirement
to pay the annual charges, nor does it exonerate the licensee or exemptee from the assessment of penalties under &sect;11.21.
If a bill for annual charges becomes payable after an application for an exemption has been filed and while the application
is still pending for decision, the bill may be paid under protest and subject to refund.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Annual charges must be paid no later than 30 days after rendition of a bill by the Commission. If the licensee or exemptee
believes that the bill is incorrect, no later than 30 days after its rendition the licensee or exemptee may file an appeal
of the bill with the Chief Financial Officer. No later than 30 days after the date of issuance of the Chief Financial
Officer's decision on the appeal, the licensee or exemptee may file a request for rehearing of that decision pursuant
to &sect;385.713 of this chapter. In the event that a timely appeal to the Chief Financial Officer or a timely request
to the Commission for rehearing is filed, the payment of the bill may be made under protest, and subject to refund pending
the outcome of the appeal or rehearing.

The table in Appendix A shows illustrative annual charges for representative municipal and non-municipal licensees
and exemptees. It is based on the regulatory scheme described in the Alternative A regulatory text at the end of the
NOPR. Thus, the table is based on allocation of all of the annual charges among a single class of licensees and exemptees,
including all major and minor municipal and non-municipal licensees and all exemptees. The allocation is based solely
on the respective capacity of each hydropower project as measured in kilowatts, with a minimum charge of $100 and a
maximum charge of two percent of the total of all charges. Assessments would not commence prior to the commencement
of project construction. Finally, the table reflects the charges as they would become due over a three-year phase-in
period.

The table in Appendix B shows illustrative annual charges for representative municipal and non-municipal licensees
and exemptees based on the regulatory scheme described in the Alternative B regulatory text at the end of the NOPR.
Thus, the table retains the current separate categories and formulae for major municipal and non-municipal licensees.
Minor licensees and exemptees are classified with the comparable groups of major licensees and their charges are
assessed pursuant to the formulae currently used for those groups.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend the standard of identity for peanut butter to remove the
statement that added vitamins are not suitable ingredients of this food. If this change is adopted, manufacturers
will be able to add vitamins to make modified peanut butter in accordance with the agency's general definition and
standard of identity for food named by the use of a nutrient content claim (such as ``reduced fat'' or ``reduced calorie'')
and a standardized term (peanut butter). FDA is proposing to take this action because it tentatively finds that providing
for modified forms of peanut butter will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. Thus, the agency
tentatively concludes that this action will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2431), FDA adopted &sect;130.10 (21 CFR 130.10). This regulation provides for the use of nutrient
content claims defined in part 101 (21 CFR part 101), such as ``fat free,'' ``low calorie,'' or ``light,'' in conjunction
with a traditional standardized food name (e.g., ``sour cream'') to define a new food such as ``reduced fat sour cream.''
The purpose of the new general standard of identity is to provide for modified versions of certain standardized foods
and thereby to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general standard of identity in &sect;130.10 requires, among other things, that the modified versions of the
standardized foods: (1) Not be nutritionally inferior to the traditional standardized food, (2) possess performance
characteristics, such as physical properties, flavor characteristics, functional properties, and shelf life,
that are similar to those of the traditional standardized food, (3) contain a significant amount of any mandatory
ingredient required to be in the traditional food, and (4) be made from the same types of ingredients as permitted in
the standard for the traditional food, except that ingredients may be used to improve texture, prevent syneresis,
add flavor, extend shelf life, improve appearance, or add sweetness. Section 130.10(d)(5) also provides for the
use of water and fat analogs to replace fat and calories but specifically prohibits the replacement of required ingredients
of standardized foods with ingredients from a different source. For example, vegetable oil may not replace milkfat
in the manufacture of a modified version of sour cream. Furthermore, &sect;130.10(d)(3) of the general standard
of identity prohibits the use in the modified food of any ingredient or component of an ingredient whose use in the traditional
food is specifically prohibited by the standard of identity for that food (21 CFR parts 131 through 169).

 of January 6, 1993, in a document entitled ``Food Labeling Regulations Implementing the Nutrition Labeling and Education
Act of 1990; Opportunity for Comments'' (58 FR 2066) (hereinafter referred to as the ``implementation final rule''),
FDA provided an opportunity for comment on technical issues raised by the final regulations on food labeling that
it published on that date, including &sect;130.10. The implementation final rule, among other things, provided
30 days for the submission of comments on technical issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the implementation final rule, the agency received several inquiries regarding ingredients whose
use in modified foods is prohibited under &sect;130.10(d)(3) of the general standard. Comments claimed that this
provision is inconsistent with &sect;130.10(b), which requires that nutrients be added to the new food to restore
nutrient levels so that the new food is not nutritionally inferior to the traditional food. One comment suggested
that FDA amend &sect;130.10(d)(3) by adding an exception to allow for compliance with &sect;130.10(b). This comment
contended that without such an exception, no nutritionally improved versions of important products such as peanut
butter would be permitted, except when labeled as imitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 18, 1993, FDA published a final rule entitled ``Food Labeling: Nutrient Content Claims, General Principles,
Petitions, Definition of Terms; Definitions of Nutrient Content Claims for Fat, Fatty Acids, and Cholesterol content
of Foods; Food Standards: Requirements for Foods Named by Use of a Nutrient Content Claim and a Standardized Term;
Technical Amendment'' (58 FR 44020) (hereinafter referred to as ``the technical amendment''). In this document,
the agency acknowledged that it was arguable that there was a conflict between &sect;130.10(b) and (d)(3) (58 FR 44020
at page 44028) but stated that no conflict between these provisions was intended. It recognized, however, that while
the need to ensure that the modified food is consistent in characteristics with the traditional standardized food
in as many ways as possible, and the need to ensure that the modified food is not made with ingredients not permitted
in the traditional food, normally support each other, in the case of peanut butter, and only peanut butter, they work
to prevent the creation of modified peanut butter products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard of identity for peanut butter in &sect;164.150(c) (21 CFR 164.150(c)) states that artificial flavorings,
artificial sweeteners, chemical preservatives, added vitamins, and color additives are not suitable ingredients
for use in the food. Based on testimony at the hearings held when the standard of identity for peanut butter was adopted
and the resulting findings of fact (33 FR 10506 at 10509, July 24, 1968), the agency adopted this prohibition on the
addition of vitamins to peanut butter because such addition is unnecessary when the peanut butter is consumed as part
of a balanced diet. As a result of the prohibition on vitamin addition in the peanut butter standard (&sect;164.150(c)),
it may not be possible to formulate a modified peanut butter product that is not nutritionally inferior to peanut butter
under the general standard of identity. For example, if the level of vitamins is reduced in making the modified peanut
butter product, e.g., a ``reduced calorie'' or ``reduced fat'' peanut butter, vitamins would have to be added to ensure
compliance with &sect;130.10(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the technical amendment, the agency discussed the appropriateness of amending the standard of identity for peanut
butter to remove the specific prohibition regarding the addition of vitamins in &sect;164.150(c) as well as the appropriateness
of the option suggested in comments of modifying &sect;130.10 to allow the addition of nutrients to modified peanut
butter products (58 FR 44020 at 44028 and 44029). FDA stated that it was the agency's preliminary view that it is more
appropriate to amend the standard of identity for peanut butter to remove the specific prohibition regarding the
addition of vitamins than to modify &sect;130.10. FDA said that amendment of the peanut butter standard would accomplish
the same result as the suggested modification of &sect;130.10 but would allow the general standard of identity to
remain a generic standard applicable to any standardized food. FDA is now proposing to amend &sect;164.150(c) to
effect this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency points out that FDA's regulations make provision for nonstandardized spreadable peanut products. Under
&sect;102.23 (21 CFR 102.23), these products may be labeled with the common or usual name ``peanut spreads,'' provided
that the identity statement contains a statement of the percent of peanut ingredient, and the product complies with
the nutrient content requirements in &sect;102.23. This regulation has not, however, fostered a large number of
products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that amendment of the peanut butter standard to remove the prohibition on added vitamins will lead to
the creation of more peanut products than has been the case under &sect;102.23 because manufacturers will be able
to use the term ``peanut butter'' instead of ``peanut spread'' in the names of their products. Further, FDA believes
that the use of defined nutrient content claims will promote uniformity in labeling and will enhance consumer recognition
of modified peanut butter products that have been designed to achieve a nutritional goal. This enhanced recognition
will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. Thus, FDA tentatively finds that a change in the
peanut butter standard that will permit the use of added vitamins in the production of modified peanut butter products
is in the best interest of consumers. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to revise &sect;164.150(c) by removing the specific
prohibition regarding ``added vitamins.'' This change will allow the addition of nutrients normally present in
peanut butter that would otherwise be reduced in manufacturing the modified peanut butter products, thereby ensuring
that the modified version of the food will not be nutritionally inferior to peanut butter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA notes that the removal of the specific prohibition against added vitamins in the peanut butter standard does not
change the agency's position that added vitamins are not necessary for peanut butter that has not been modified when
it is consumed in a balanced diet. Thus, if vitamins were added to a food that complies with the standard of identity
in &sect;164.150, the resultant food would not be peanut butter.

II. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health, and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity). The
Regulatory Flexibility Act requires analyzing options for regulatory relief for small businesses. The proposed
removal of the specific prohibition regarding added vitamins in the peanut butter standard of identity will not affect
the manufacture or labeling of peanut butter as defined in &sect;164.150. However, it will provide an additional
option to manufacturers of spreadable peanut products that do not comply with the standard of identity for peanut
butter. It will permit the manufacture and labeling of some modified peanut butter products in accordance with the
general definition and standard of identity in &sect;130.10. Products complying with the general definition and
standard of identity may be named by use of a nutrient content claim and the standardized term ``peanut butter,'' thereby
minimizing confusion to consumers regarding the nature of the food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the manufacture of modified peanut butter products complying with the new general definition and standard
of identity is optional, and manufacturers may continue to make nonstandardized spreadable peanut products in accordance
with the common or usual name regulation in &sect;102.23 and peanut butter in accordance with the standard of identity
in &sect;164.150, FDA does not believe that the proposed change to remove the specific prohibition regarding ``added
vitamins'' in the standard of identity will have any adverse economic impact on manufacturers. Therefore, FDA finds
that this proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. In addition, FDA
certifies in accordance with section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that no significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities will derive from this action.

III. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(1) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend regulations for certain section 8 project-based assistance programs to provide that
a section 8 family may be evicted for drug crimes or for criminal activity that threatens other residents. Eviction
may be based on such criminal activity by a household member, a guest or another person under the tenant's control.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For existing housing under the section 8 Loan Management Program (24 CFR part 886, subpart A) and section 8 Property
Disposition Program (24 CFR part 886, subpart C), the proposed rule would implement section 8 of the United States
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(d)(1)(B)(iii)), as amended by section 546 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National
Affordable Housing Act and section 145 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, HUD's Multifamily Model Lease (Handbook 4350.3 Appendix 19a) contains similar provisions allowing
eviction for drug-related criminal activities or criminal activity that threatens other residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would revise 24 CFR parts 247, 880, 881 and 883. The proposed rule would apply to evictions under
the section 8 new construction and substantial rehabilitation programs and under the section 8 Loan Management and
Property Disposition Programs. This proposed rule also would cover the following subsidized projects subject to
24 CFR part 247: multifamily housing projects that receive the benefit of subsidy in the form of below-market interest
rates under sections 221(d)(3) and (5); interest reduction payments under section 236 of the National Housing Act,
including Rental Assistance Payments (RAP); below-market interest rate direct loans under section 202 of the Housing
Act of 1959; rental subsidy in the form of rent supplement payments under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1965; section 8 in connection with section 202 Loans for Housing for the Elderly or Handicapped (24 CFR part 885),
the section 8 Additional Assistance Program for Projects with HUD-Insured and HUD-Held Mortgages (24 CFR part 886,
subpart A) and the section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-Owned Projects (24 CFR part 886,
subpart C).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would be applied uniformly to all assisted housing tenants for the programs listed above. The rule
proposes to add criminal activity, including drug-related criminal activity, as grounds for termination of tenancy.
The existing requirement that an owner not evict any tenant, except by judicial action pursuant to State or local law
and in accordance with the Department's regulations and its due process procedures, will remain in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

(c) of this section.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule proposes to amend the regulations to implement statutory authority to insure assisted living facilities
for the care of frail elderly persons, as authorized by section 511 of the Housing and Community Development Act of
1992. This proposed rule would also expand current regulations to include the refinancing of conventional (non-FHA
insured) nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, assisted living facilities or board and care homes under
section 223(f) of the National Housing Act, and to insure additions to existing such projects. Finally, this proposed
rule would make conforming changes required by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, and would make minor
technical changes to the regulations to remove ambiguity and reflect long-standing Departmental policy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, under section 232 of the National Housing Act (NHA), and the accompanying regulations at 24 CFR part 232,
the Department insures mortgages for nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, and board and care homes. Section
511 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992 (1992
HCD Act), amends section 232 of the NHA by authorizing FHA mortgage insurance for assisted living facilities. In compliance
with section 511 of the 1992 HCD Act, this proposed rule would revise 24 CFR part 232 to make assisted living facilities
for the care of the frail elderly eligible for mortgage insurance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the NHA and this proposed rule, the term ``assisted living facility'' means a public facility, proprietary
facility, or facility of a private nonprofit corporation that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is licensed and regulated by the State or if there is no State law providing for such licensing and regulation by
the State, by the municipality or other political subdivision in which the facility is located; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Makes available to residents supportive services to assist the residents in carrying out activities of daily
living such as bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed or chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the toilet,
laundry, home management, preparing meals, shopping for personal items, obtaining and taking medications, managing
money, using the telephone, or performing light or heavy housework, and which may make available to residents home
health care services, such as nursing, and therapy; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Provides separate dwelling units for residents, each of which may contain a full kitchen or bathroom, and includes
common rooms and other facilities appropriate for the provision of supportive services to residents of the facility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the NHA and this proposed rule, the term ``frail elderly'' has the same meaning as the term in section 802(k) of
the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA). Section 802(k)(8) defines ``frail elderly'' as
meaning an elderly person who is unable to perform at least three activities of daily living adopted by the Secretary.
(The term ``activity for daily living'' means an activity regularly necessary for personal care and includes bathing,
dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed and chairs, walking, going outdoors, and using the toilet.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An assisted living facility may be free-standing, or part of a complex that includes a nursing home, an intermediate
care facility, a board and care facility or any combination of the above. However, in compliance with section 511 of
the 1992 HCD Act, this proposed rule would not authorize mortgage insurance for an assisted living facility unless
the Secretary determines that the level of financing acquired by the mortgagor and any other resources available
for the facility are sufficient to ensure that the facility contains dwelling units and facilities for the provision
of supportive services; the mortgagor provides satisfactory assurances that no dwelling unit in the facility will
be occupied by more than one person without the consent of all such occupants; and the appropriate state licensing
agency for the state, municipality or other political subdivision in which the facility is or is to be located provides
adequate assurances that the facility will comply with any applicable standards and requirements for such facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 511 of the 1992 HCD Act also amends section 223(f) of the NHA. In accordance with section 511, this proposed
rule would authorize the refinancing of an existing assisted living facility. This proposed rule would also expand
the section 232 program to include the refinancing of conventional projects under section 223(f) of the National
Housing Act. Section 409 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 amended section 223(f) of the NHA to cover
the refinancing of existing debt of an existing nursing home, existing intermediate care facility, existing board
and care facility (collectively referred to as ``residential care facility), or any combination of the above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, after section 409 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 was enacted, the Department only implemented
section 409 for existing FHA-insured residential care facilities. (On August 31, 1988 (53 FR 33735), the Department
added insurance for existing residential care facilities that are currently FHA-insured.) HUD's decision not to
implement section 409 in its entirety was based on the fact that HUD had no experience in underwriting existing residential
care facilities. By limiting the insurance for refinanced transactions to currently FHA-insured projects with
a known track record (annual inspections, availability of audited financial statements, etc.), the Department
could more adequately protect the General Insurance Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the House Conference Report for the NAHA (H.R. 101&hyph;943, 101st Cong. 2d Sess, at 524) emphasizes Congress's
intent that the Department fully implement section 409 to include conventional (non-FHA insured) projects. Accordingly,
the Department is now expanding the program to include mortgages for the purchase and refinancing of existing residential
care facilities with non-FHA insured mortgages under section 232 pursuant to section 223(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement further statutory changes, this proposed rule would make projects consisting of an addition to an existing
(non-FHA insured) nursing home, board and care facility, intermediate care facility, or assisted living facility
eligible for mortgage insurance under section 232 of the NHA. Moreover, this proposed rule would increase the loan-to-value
ratio for private nonprofit mortgagors from 90 percent to 95 percent, and would make conforming changes for fire safety
equipment for assisted living facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to statutory changes, this proposed rule would make minor technical amendments to part 232. Specifically,
this proposed rule would move the definition of substantial rehabilitation from &sect;232.902(b) to the definitional
section of the regulations (section 232.1), and revise the definition of substantial rehabilitation to reflect
the requirement that rehabilitation must involve two or more major building components. The current wording ``more
than one building component'' could be erroneously interpreted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the word ``additions'' would be removed from the definition of substantial rehabilitation. The placement
of ``additions'' in &sect;232.902(b) of the existing regulations has caused confusion because it incorrectly suggests
that the cost of an addition to an existing building can be used in calculating the 15 percent of value criterion. The
term ``additions,'' as used in &sect;232.902(b) was intended to mean an addition of a new project element in a residential
care facility, such as a whirlpool bath, safety railing, etc. The Department wants to emphasize that these revisions
to the definition of substantial rehabilitation do not reflect a policy change, but are technical changes which reflect
the Department's long standing administrative policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this proposed rule would increase the loan-to-value ratio for private nonprofit mortgagors from 85 percent
to 90 percent for the purchase or refinance of a residential care facility which does not involve substantial rehabilitation.

The Secretary in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed and approved this
proposed rule, and in so doing certifies that this proposed rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Specifically, the proposed rule expands eligible projects for FHA mortgage insurance
to include assisted living facilities, and additions to existing projects, neither of which are expected to have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, the proposed rule is directed to owners
of residential care facilities, and will not impinge upon the relationship between the Federal Government and State
and local governments. As a result, the proposed rule is not subject to review under the order.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
proposed rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,
and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will
result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its adjudication regulations concerning presumptive
service connection for certain diseases even though there is no record of the disease during service. This proposed
amendment is necessary to implement a decision of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under the authority granted by
the Agent Orange Act of 1991 that there is a positive association between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic
of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and the subsequent development of multiple myeloma and respiratory cancers. The
intended effect of this proposed amendment is to establish presumptive service connection for those conditions
based on herbicide exposure.

 Section 2(a)(1) of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Public Law 102&hyph;4, 105 Stat. 11 (1991), added 38 U.S.C. 1116 which
established presumptive service connection for veterans with service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam
era who subsequently develop, to a degree of 10 percent or more, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma (subject
to specified statutory exceptions), and chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne (within
one year of the last date of active service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era), even though there is no
record of that disease during military service. Final regulations implementing this statutory provision were published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 19, 1993 (See 58 FR 29107&hyph;09). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3 of Public Law 102&hyph;4 directed the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) to review the scientific evidence concerning the association between exposure to herbicides used in support
of military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and each disease suspected to be associated
with such exposure. Congress mandated that NAS determine, to the extent possible: (1) Whether there is a statistical
association between the suspect diseases and herbicide exposure, taking into account the strength of the scientific
evidence and the appropriateness of the methods used to detect the association; (2) the increased risk of disease
among individuals exposed to herbicides during service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era; and (3)
whether there is a plausible biological mechanism or other evidence of a causal relationship between herbicide exposure
and the suspect disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1116(b) of 38 U.S.C. provides that whenever the Secretary determines, based on sound medical and scientific
evidence, that a positive association exists between exposure of humans to an herbicide agent (i.e., a chemical in
an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during
the Vietnam era) and a disease, the Secretary will publish regulations establishing presumptive service connection
for that disease. An association is considered ``positive'' if the credible evidence for the association is equal
to or outweighs the credible evidence against the association. In making that determination, the Secretary is to
consider reports received from NAS as well as other available sound medical and scientific evidence and analyses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing approximately 6,420 abstracts of scientific or medical articles and approximately 230 epidemiologic
studies, consulting with outside experts, and conducting public hearings, NAS issued a report, entitled ``Veterans
and Agent Orange: Health Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam'', on July 27, 1993. NAS concluded that there is sufficient
evidence of an association between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development
of chloracne, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, Hodgkin's disease and porphyria cutanea tarda. VA
was already paying compensation for the first three conditions based upon the statutory presumptions established
by Public Law 102&hyph;4, and the Secretary announced that same day that he had concluded that a positive association
exists between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development of Hodgkin's
disease and porphyria cutanea tarda. Proposed regulations were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 28, 1993 (See 58 FR 50528&hyph;30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also announced that VA would review the remaining findings in the NAS report to determine whether a positive
association exists between herbicide exposure and any other conditions. That review has been completed and the Secretary
has concluded that a positive association exists for multiple myeloma and respiratory cancers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAS report found ``limited/suggestive evidence''_a category it defined as meaning that evidence suggests an

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association between herbicide exposure and a specific disease, but that chance, bias, and confounding cannot be
ruled out with confidence_of an association between herbicide exposure and the subsequent development of multiple
myeloma. VA, however, found the evidence concerning multiple myeloma, a malignant proliferation of plasma cells
which are derived from B lymphocytes, to be convincing. Most of the studies reviewed by NAS showed an increased risk,
although in most cases it was not a statistically significant increase. One occupational study (Fingerhut M.A.,
Halperin W.E., Marlow D.A., Piacitelli L.A., Honchar P.A., Sweeney M.H., Greife A.L., Dill P.A., Steenland K., Suruda
A.J. 1991. Cancer mortality in workers exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. New England Journal of
Medicine 324:212&hyph;218) found a relationship between herbicide exposure and multiple myeloma. Although this
finding was not supported by the findings of Saracci and colleagues (Saracci R., Kogevinas M., Bertazzi P.A., Bueno
De Mesquita B.H., Coggon D., Green L.M., Kauppinen T., L'Abbe K.A., Littorin M., Lynge E., Mathews J.D., Neuberger
M., Osman J., Pearce N., Winkelman R. 1991. Cancer mortality in workers exposed to chlorophenoxy herbicides and chlorophenols.
Lancet 338:1027&hyph;1032), the Saracci study is flawed as a result of questions regarding exposure. Another study
(Pesatori A.C., Consonni D., Tironi A., Landi M.T., Zocchetti C., Bertazzi P.A. 1992. Cancer morbidity in the Seveso
area, 1976&hyph;1986. Chemosphere 25:209&hyph;212) showed a clear association between herbicide exposure and
multiple myeloma in both males and females. Moreover, multiple myeloma is closely related biologically to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; consequently, the epidemiological evidence concerning non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
gives added weight to the association between herbicide exposure and multiple myeloma. Based on this clinical consideration
and the weight of the epidemiogical evidence, the Secretary has determined that there is a positive association between
herbicide exposure and multiple myeloma that manifests itself to a degree of 10 percent at any time after exposure.
We are proposing to amend 38 CFR 3.309(e) to implement the Secretary's decision. This amendment is proposed to be effective
the date of publication of the final rule, as provided by Public Law 102&hyph;4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAS report also found limited/suggestive evidence of an association between herbicide exposure and the subsequent
development of respiratory cancers, specifically cancers of the lung, larynx, or trachea. For study purposes, NAS
included cancer of the bronchus when it considered cancer of the lung; therefore, we are including cancer of the bronchus
within the scope of the proposed presumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing the NAS report, which noted that not all studies had fully controlled for or evaluated smoking as a confounding
factor, VA gave weight to the fact that the studies found high relative risks for respiratory cancers in production
workers (Manz A., Berger J., Dwyer J.H., Flesch-Janys D., Nagel S., Waltsgott H. 1991. Cancer mortality among workers
in chemical plant contaminated with dioxin. Lancet 338:959&hyph;964; Fingerhut et al., 1991). The Fingerhut study
showed an increased risk with the duration of exposure. VA also noted that despite the failure of some studies to control
for smoking, it is unlikely that there were major differences in smoking patterns between the study and control groups.
Considering all of the evidence, the Secretary has determined that the credible evidence for an association outweighs
the credible evidence against an association and that there is, therefore, a positive association between exposure
to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development of respiratory cancers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
VA also found that the weight of the available evidence indicates that chemically-induced respiratory cancers manifest
within a definite period following exposure, after which there is little effect from the exposure (Finkelstein M.M.,
1991. Use of ``time windows'' to investigate lung cancer latency intervals at an Ontario steel plant. American Journal
of Industrial Medicine 19:299&hyph;235). In our judgment, it is reasonable to assume that respiratory cancers due
to herbicide exposure will show a risk pattern similar to other chemically-induced respiratory cancers, and we are
proposing as part of our rule that respiratory cancer will be presumed service connected only if it is manifest within
30 years after exposure. The longest manifestation period noted for a respiratory cancer following herbicide exposure
is about 30 years (Zach J.A., Suskind R.R. 1980. The mortality experience of workers exposed to tetrachlorodibenzodioxin
in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trichlorophenol process accident. Journal of Occupational Medicine 22:11&hyph;14; Zober A., Messerer P., Huber
P. 1990. Thirty-four year mortality follow-up of BASF employees to 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD after the 1953 accident. Occupational
Environmental Health 62:139&hyph;157). If future studies indicate that this manifestation period is inappropriate,
VA will amend it accordingly. We are proposing to amend 38 CFR 3.307(a) and 3.309(e) to implement the Secretary's decision.
This amendment is proposed to be effective the date of publication of the final rule, as provided by Public Law 102&hyph;4.

38 U.S.C. 1113 provides that where there is affirmative evidence to the contrary, or evidence to establish that an
intercurrent injury or disease which is a recognized cause of any of the diseases for which presumptive service connection
may be allowed under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1112 (i.e., chronic diseases, tropical diseases, prisoner-of-war
related diseases, or diseases specific to radiation-exposed veterans), has been suffered between the date of separation
from service and the onset of any such diseases, or the disability is due to the veteran's own willful misconduct, presumptive
service connection will not be in order. Section 2(b) of public law 102&hyph;4 amends 38 U.S.C. 1113 so that its provisions
also apply to the presumptive conditions associated with herbicide exposure under 38 U.S.C. 1116. Consequently,
service connection for multiple myeloma or respiratory cancers based on herbicide exposure is precluded if there
is affirmative evidence that establishes a non-service related supervening condition or event as the cause of the
multiple myeloma or respiratory cancers, or the disability is due to the veteran's own willful misconduct (See 38
U.S.C. 1113).

The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has determined that it is not feasible to allow the 60 day comment period referred to in section 6(a)(1)
of Executive Order 12866 because a comment period of that length would prevent VA from complying with the statutory
requirement to publish a final rule within 90 days of publication of the proposed rule imposed by 38 U.S.C. 1116(c)(2).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice announces the EPA's plans to review and revise the Air Quality Criteria for Ozone and Other Photochemical
Oxidants (Criteria Document) as rapidly as possible and to complete review of the national ambient air quality standards
(NAAQS) for ozone (O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) as soon as possible thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act (Act) requires periodic review and, if appropriate, revision of the NAAQS and of the air quality criteria
on which they are based. The EPA completed its last formal review of the air quality criteria for O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in 1989. Based on that review, the EPA announced a final decision on March 9, 1993 not to revise the existing O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since early 1989, however, a substantial number of new studies on the health and environmental effects of O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 have appeared in the peer-reviewed literature. The EPA is moving as rapidly as possible to review them, consistent
with assuring a sound, scientifically-supportable decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review process includes: (1) Reviewing and revising the Criteria Document; (2) reviewing the NAAQS through development
of a Staff Paper based on the revised Criteria Document; (3) external review of Criteria Document and Staff Paper drafts
by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board, an independent panel
of scientific experts, and by the public; and (4) examining implementation ramifications of changes to the O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS. The EPA intends to adhere to strict schedules for external review of Criteria Document and Staff Paper drafts
consistent with a full opportunity for thorough scientific and public review, and to deny any requests for extensions
of the public comment periods specified in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During this NAAQS review, the EPA intends to continue implementing programs designed to meet the current standards
and the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 to ensure continued improvement in air quality. The EPA
is also examining options for implementing alternative O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on a Criteria Document issued by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1970, the EPA promulgated
the first NAAQS for photochemical oxidants under section 109 of the Act (36 FR 8186) in 1971. The primary and secondary
NAAQS were both set at an hourly average of 0.08 parts per million (ppm) total photochemical oxidants not to be exceeded
more than 1 hour per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1977, the EPA announced (42 FR 20493) the first review and updating of the 1970 Criteria Document in accordance with
section 109(d)(1) of the Act. The EPA published a Criteria Document in 1978. Based on the revised Criteria Document
and taking into account public comments on revisions proposed to the primary and secondary NAAQS in 1978 (43 FR 16962),
the EPA announced revisions to the 1971 standards in 1979 (44 FR 8202). The primary standard was revised from 0.08 parts
per million (ppm) to 0.12 ppm; the secondary standard was set identical to the primary standard; the chemical designation
of the standards was changed from photochemical oxidants to O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; and the form of the standards was revised from a deterministic form to a statistical form, which defines attainment
of the standards as occurring when the expected number of days per calendar year with maximum hourly average concentrations
greater than 0.12 ppm is equal to or less than one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1982 (47 FR 11561), the EPA announced plans to revise the 1978 Criteria Document. In 1983, the EPA announced (48 FR
38009) that review of primary and secondary standards for O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 had been initiated. The EPA subsequently provided a number of opportunities for public review and comment on drafts
of the Criteria Document and associated Staff Paper (Review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone:
Assessment of Scientific and Technical Information_Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards Staff Paper).
After reviewing the draft Criteria Document in 1985 and 1986, the CASAC sent the Administrator a ``closure letter''
outlining key issues and recommendations and indicating that it was satisfied with the final draft of the 1986 Criteria
Document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following closure, a number of scientific articles and abstracts were published or accepted for publication that
appeared to be of sufficient importance concerning potential health and welfare effects of O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to warrant preparation of a supplement to the Criteria Document (Supplement). The CASAC, having already reviewed
two drafts of the Staff Paper in 1986 and 1987, concluded that sufficient new information existed to recommend incorporation
of relevant new information into a third draft of the Staff Paper.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CASAC held a public meeting in 1988 to review a draft Supplement and the third draft Staff Paper. Major issues included:
The definition of adverse health effects of O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; the significance of health studies suggesting that exercising individuals exposed for 6 to 8 hours to O

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels at or below 0.12 ppm may experience lung inflammation and transient decreases in pulmonary function; the possibility
that chronic irreversible effects may result from long-term exposures to elevated levels of O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; and, the importance of analyses indicating that agricultural crop damage may be better defined by a cumulative seasonal
average than by a 1-hour peak level of O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In its ``closure letter'' of 1989, the CASAC indicated that the draft Supplement and draft Staff Paper ``provide
an adequate scientific basis for the EPA to retain or revise primary and secondary standards for ozone.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 22, 1991, the American Lung Association and other plaintiffs filed suit under section 304 of the Act to compel
the EPA to complete its review of the criteria and standards for O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

issued an order requiring the EPA to sign a

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice announcing its final decision by March 1, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 10, 1992 (57 FR 35542), the EPA published a proposed decision under section 109(d)(1) that revisions to the
existing primary and secondary standards were not appropriate at that time. The notice explained in some detail (see
57 FR 35546) that the proposed decision would complete the EPA's review of information on health and welfare effects
of O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 assembled over a 7-year period and contained in the 1986 Criteria Document and the 1989 Supplement. The notice made
clear that the Administrator did not take into account more recent studies on the health and welfare effects of O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because these studies had not been assessed in the 1986&hyph;1989 Criteria Document/Supplement, nor had they collectively
undergone the rigorous, integrative review process (including CASAC review) required to incorporate them into
a new criteria document. The proposed decision, therefore, was based on an evaluation of key studies published through
early 1989 as contained in the 1986&hyph;89 Criteria Document/Supplement, the 1989 Staff Paper assessment of the
most relevant information in these documents, and the advice and recommendations of the CASAC as presented both in
the discussion of these documents at public meetings and in the CASAC's 1986 and 1989 ``closure letters.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the large number of recent scientific papers and ongoing research on the health and welfare effects of O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the August 10, 1992 notice also announced the EPA's intention to proceed as rapidly as possible with the next review
of the air quality criteria and standards for O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. On March 9, 1993 (58 FR 13008) the EPA published its final decision not to revise the current primary and secondary
NAAQS for O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because of the scientific and technical complexity of such assessments, the EPA had estimated that 2 to 3 years would
be necessary to rigorously assess more than 1,000 new studies and incorporate key information into a revised criteria
document, to evaluate the significance of the key information for decision-making purposes, to develop staff recommendations
for the Administrator, and to provide appropriate opportunities for CASAC review and public comment. Given the potential
importance of the new studies and the EPA's continuing concern about the health and welfare effects of O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the March 9, 1993 notice also indicated the Administrator's intention to move the review process ahead as quickly
as possible and, if appropriate, to propose revisions of the standards at the earliest possible date.

 Current Review Process/Schedule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following publication of the March 9, 1993 decision, the Agency, in consultation with the CASAC and the Science Advisory
Board, undertook a rigorous examination of the NAAQS review process designed to identify all measures that could
be taken to accelerate its review of the criteria and standards for O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 consistent with assuring a sound and scientifically-credible decision. As a result, the EPA has adopted a number
of measures intended to accelerate the O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS review. These measures include: (1) Conducting review and revision of the Criteria Document and development
of the Staff Paper and associated analyses (e.g., exposure analysis and health risk assessments) in a more concurrent
fashion than in the previous NAAQS reviews; (2) adhering to strict schedules for external review of Criteria Document
and Staff Paper drafts consistent with a full opportunity for thorough scientific and public review; (3) establishing
a highly-expedited Agency review process with senior level management oversight and involvement throughout the
process, as well as early discussion of possible options with other Federal agencies, including the Office of Management
and Budget; and (4) reducing the volume of information included in the revised Criteria Document by focusing on the
most important new studies and setting a date beyond which new studies will not be included.

in the review should take note of the process outlined in this notice and be prepared to respond promptly when opportunities
to comment are offered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the scientific and technical complexity of the issues likely to be involved in the O

, and the need to ensure that its ultimate decision is soundly based, the EPA cannot, of course, provide any absolute
assurance that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it will meet all of the interim milestone dates indicated in Table 1. Completion of the necessary steps in a timely manner
is also predicated upon the availability of adequate resources during the review process. However, the Administrator
has emphasized a high priority on meeting the accelerated schedule outlined in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To that end, the review process is well under way. The EPA initiated action to update the air quality criteria for O

Document (58 FR 35454) in July 1993. Additional workshops on draft air quality and ecological effects chapters (58
FR 48063) were held in September 1993. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then, the EPA has discussed the schedule and process outlined in this notice with the CASAC (58 FR 59034). The EPA is
also conducting exposure and risk analyses. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcommittee of the CASAC met on December 16, 1993 to review methodologies (58 FR 63345). A further subcommittee meeting
on risk analysis is planned for spring 1994.

This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes to amend rules which regulate the terms and conditions under which
customer-provided terminal equipment may be connected to the telephone network. The proceeding was initiated by
petitions for rulemaking filed by Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (SWB) and Ameritech Operating Companies
(Ameritech) who ask that regulations governing switched digital services be added. The effect of the proposed rules
would be to promote rapid exploitation of switched digital technology. We propose also to provide for a registration
revocation procedure which should greatly enhance our ability to enforce applicable rules as well as the Telecommunications
Trade Act of 1988; and we take this opportunity to propose clarifications to other rules.

Analysis of Proceeding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. By this NPRM we contemplate amending parts 2 and 68 of the rules, 47 CFR parts 2 and 68. A purpose of part 68 is to maintain
uniform standards for the protection of the telephone network from harms caused by the connection of terminal equipment
and associated wiring. This proceeding was initiated by two petitions for rulemaking, one filed by SWB (RM&hyph;7815)
and the other by Ameritech (RM&hyph;6147). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. SWB requests that part 68 be amended to include the regulation of terminal equipment connected to the two-wire Basic
Rate Access (BRA) interface and to the Primary Rate Access (PRA) interface provided by Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) access technology. BRA consists of one or two 64 Kbps information channels with a 16 Kbps channel for
dialing and network access information. The 1.544 Mbps PRA consists of 23 64 Kbps information channels and the 64 Kbps
dialing and network access channel. ISDN is in a developmental phase, being deployed these last few years in an experimental
mode. The Public Notice of SWB's petition elicited comments from eight parties and reply comments from three. There
was overwhelming support for including this service in part 68 in order to promote, on a nationwide and worldwide basis,
rapid exploitation of this technology with minimum mandatory criteria for connection of CPE (customer premises
equipment). Thus, we propose for comment technical standards for including this service in part 68 in supplement
to the existing standards for non-switched leased-line digital services which were added in 1985. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Commenting on SWB's petition, AT&amp;T recommends (a) that part 68 rules covering PRA not be limited to the two-wire
ISDN BRA service but also authorize terminal equipment connected to the 4-wire ISDN PRA (1.544 Mbps) interface pursuant
to performance and compatibility standards adopted by ANSI (American National Standards Institute); (b) that amendments
to part 68 provide equipment specifications for both PRA and BRA interfaces; (c) that &sect;68.308(h)(2) be amended
to apply its limitations on encoded analog content to PRA terminal equipment comparable to the limitations suggested
by SWB for BRA terminal equipment; and (d) that the signaling interference requirements in &sect;68.314(d)(2) apply
also to ISDN terminal equipment. The rules we present for comment reflect those recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. AT&amp;T observes also that SWB's petition would add a new &sect;68.310(m) to introduce a ``longitudinal-to-metallic''
(L&hyph;M) balance requirement for equipment connected to the ISDN interface. AT&amp;T notes that the L&hyph;M
balance concept was rejected by the Commission in previous rulemakings in favor of the ``metallic-to-longitudinal''
(M&hyph;L) balance methodology currently in the rules. The L&hyph;M methodology is considered to be a performance
measure which is not a primary concern of part 68, whereas the M&hyph;L balance requirement squarely addresses crosstalk
interference that terminal equipment may induce in cables running to the central office, which is a harm to the network
and thus within part 68's purview. Thus, we propose adding to part 68 limitations on encoded analog content for equipment
connected to the ISDN interface.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. AT&amp;T states also that though-gain limitations in &sect;68.308(b)(5) should be established for ISDN services.
We understand that this is a current project for the Telecommunication Industry Association's (TIA's) TR&hyph;41
Committee, whom we anticipate will provide appropriate recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The types of plug-jack connectors to be used for ISDN services engendered comment. Ameritech says that the ANSI
standard for BRA proposes an eight-position non-keyed jack in which two positions are for the tip and ring connections
to the service itself, and the remaining six positions are reserved. Ameritech offers ISDN BRA via the standard RJ11C
jack which provides connections for two wires, although the jack itself can accommodate up to six wires. Most ISDN
compatible equipment can accommodate such a connection, so there is no need to require the eight-position jack, states
Ameritech, who believes that manufacturers who ``build-to'' the eight-position interface could provide connection
to the type RJ11C through a simple six-position to eight-position double-male adapter. US West recommends that the
jack type SJA&hyph;11 (8-position) proposed by ECSA (the Exchange Carriers Standards Association's T1E1 Technical
Subcommittee) be approved by the Commission's tariff implementation procedure. We solicit comments on these proposals
for ISDN BRA and PRA interface connectors and for suitable connectors for the Public Switched Digital Services (PSDS).
It would be helpful also if interested parties would, as requested in n.7 of the NPRM, offer comments on the recommendations
of ECSA for network connectors for ISDN BRA and PSDS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Public Notice of Ameritech's petition produced two comments and two reply comments. Ameritech petitions for
amendment of part 68 to include terminal equipment that connects to PSDS. We request comment. As the result of joint
comments by Mountain States Telephone Company, Northwestern Bell Telephone Company and Pacific Northwestern Bell
Telephone Company, equipment standards for a four-wire 56 Kbps service are also included for comment. It is important
to recognize that all three technologies (56 and 64 Kbps time compression and four-wire 56 Kbps switched services)
are call-compatible, and a performance and compatibility standard for the three has recently been published by TIA.
Not discussed in the pleadings is the fact that a new technology known as ``inverse multiplexing'' or ``bandwidth
on demand'' is being used which permits customers to utilize PSDS and ISDN BRA technologies to order wider bandwidths
in multiples of 56 or 64 Kbps. Commenters should address whether inverse multiplexing utilizing such channels and
other bandwidths require consideration under part 68.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In outlining the intent of newly-proposed part 68, the Commission stated in its First Supplemental Notice, released
April 3, 1973, 40 F.C.C.2d 315, 316 (1973) that ``[r]egistration would constitute authorization for the equipment
to be directly connected to the switched telephone network. However, in appropriate cases, registration could be
revoked.'' But the rules do not include part 68 equipment authorization revocation procedures which can be relied
upon; therefore, we propose adoption of rules which detail the circumstances under which equipment registrations
may be revoked and which define equipment revocation procedures, including automatic denial of equipment authorization
of the same product for a period of six months from the date of revocation. The proposed revocation procedure tracks
closely established Commission procedure for Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL) for assessment of a monetary penalty
(47 CFR 1.80 and 1.89). Revocation of an equipment registration may be imposed in addition to or in lieu of an amount
in forfeiture pursuant to section 1.80 of the rules. Therefore, we propose that a Notice of Intent to Revoke may be served
concurrently with and as part of a NAL. In the case of joint NAL and Intent to Revoke, &sect;1.80 of the rules would govern
all procedural issues. In those cases where a material dispute of fact is involved, the Commission would, if appropriate,
designate the proceeding for hearing before an administrative law judge. The registration revocation procedure
is expected to greatly enhance our ability to enforce part 68, as well as the Telecommunications Trade Act of 1988 which
requires that all telecommunications equipment imported into the United States meet the requirements of the Commission's
rules and regulations. We seek comment on these procedures which are set forth in detail in the NPRM and proposed rules.

 This notice proposes to require operators of gas distribution pipelines who do not maintain customer-owned service
lines to advise their customers of the proper maintenance of these gas lines and of the potential hazards of not properly
maintaining these gas lines. This proposed rulemaking, in response to a statutory mandate, is intended to ensure
that homeowners and other owners of customer-owned service lines are made aware of the requirements for maintenance
of those lines; the resources known to the operator that could properly aid the customer in doing such maintenance;
any information that the operator has concerning the operation and maintenance of its service lines that could aid
customers; and the potential hazards of not maintaining customer-owned service lines.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The pipeline safety regulations in 49 CFR 192.3 define a gas service line as a distribution line that transports gas
from a common source of supply to (1) a customer meter or the connection to a customer's piping, whichever is farther
downstream, or (2) the connection to a customer's piping if there is no customer meter. The source of supply for most
gas services is a main commonly located in the street. For service lines to homes and buildings, the customer meter,
which measures the transfer of gas from the operator to the consumer, is commonly located adjacent to (outside or inside)
an exterior wall. A service line may also end at a customer meter adjacent to end-use gas equipment. For all of the above
installations, the operator is responsible for compliance with part 192 standards from the common source of supply
(e.g., the main) to the end of the service line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Customer-Owned Service Lines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Not all customer meters are located adjacent to a home or building wall or end-use equipment. Some customer meters
are located at property lines or at other locations more convenient for the gas distribution operator or for the customer.
In such cases, the service line ends at the meter and the pipe running from the outlet of the meter to the exterior wall
or end-use equipment is called a customer-owned service line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instances also exist where there is no customer meter or the operator-owned service line extends beyond the meter
to the connection to a customer's piping. In such cases, the pipe running from this connection to the exterior wall
or end-use equipment is called a customer-owned service line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customer-owned service lines are also known as ``yard lines'' and ``fuel lines''. A ``farm tap'' is a customer-owned
service line that begins at a customer meter, usually adjacent to a gas transmission line, and runs (often a considerable
distance) to a single consumer. For the purposes of this notice, each of the above situations is referred to as a customer-owned
service line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customer-owned service lines are thought to comprise 12 to 17 percent of the piping that transports natural gas from
distribution mains to homes, businesses, and other consumers. These lines are predominantly found in the states
of Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia.
Many states have few, if any, customer-owned service lines because the customer meter is adjacent to the home or building
wall or the state regulatory agency has required the distribution operator to be responsible for operation and maintenance
of the service line up to the home or building wall, regardless of where the meter is placed. These states include California,
Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin,
and Wyoming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal pipeline safety regulations do not cover customer-owned service lines, although a few states have issued
regulations and some gas distribution operators voluntarily maintain these lines to part 192 standards. In most
states, the material, design, construction, corrosion control, testing, and maintenance of customer-owned service
lines is left to the discretion of people who may not be familiar with part 192 requirements for service lines. This
has resulted in instances of improper installation and minimal or no maintenance of these lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the last five years, one-third of all pipeline-related fatalities reported to the Department of Transportation
involved distribution lines running from mains to homes and other buildings. An unregulated customer-owned service
line buried downstream of a customer meter is prone to the same environmental stresses (corrosion and earth settlement)
and excavation damage hazards as a regulated service line buried upstream of a customer meter. However, because of
its proximity to homes, businesses and schools, the unregulated segment of a customer-owned service line buried
downstream of a customer meter poses a greater risk to people and property than the regulated segment of the line buried
upstream of the meter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety of customer-owned service lines first emerged as an issue after a series of five natural gas incidents occurred
during a 7-month period beginning September 16, 1988, in the Kansas City-Topeka area. These instances resulted in
four fatalities, twelve injuries, and the destruction of four homes. In three of those incidents, the failures were
attributed to corrosion on unprotected customer-owned service lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these incidents, Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, and New York made significant changes to their state's
pipeline safety regulations. These changes included extending the state regulatory authority over service lines
to the building wall. Under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (49 App. U.S.C. 1671 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), states may adopt more stringent safety regulations than the Federal regulations if the state regulations are not
incompatible with federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to its response to the accidents by extending regulatory authority to include customer-owned service
lines, the Missouri Public Service Commission also required the operator to replace some 265,000 bare steel gas lines
running from the main to the building wall, of which some 175,000 were fully or partly owned by the customer. The Kansas
City Corporation Commission required the operator to perform periodic leakage surveys of all customer-owned service
lines and to repair or replace all lines round to be leaking.

AGA Petition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The American Gas Association (AGA) has petitioned RSPA to issue immediately a proposed rule to establish the notification
regulations mandated in section 115 of the Act (P&hyph;50, September 1, 1993). In its petition, AGA expresses concern
that, lacking federal guidance, state and local authorities may move forward and adopt notification requirements
that could make compliance with federal regulations difficult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AGA has requested RSPA to incorporate the following language to satisfy the notification requirements for operations
of customer-owned service lines:

such as gas leakage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the applicable codes and standards do not address maintenance of those lines, the information that operators
provide under paragraph (a)(4) of this section must describe the maintenance requirements for customer-owned lines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The notification requirements in paragraph (a) (of this section) apply to operators for which one or more customers
have responsibility for maintenance of a substantial portion of the primary underground natural gas supply pipe
between the operator's main and the foundation wall of the customer's premise, or its equivalent in those installations
where the supply piping does not enter a building but rather goes directly to end-use equipment located outdoors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AGA's petition is on file in the docket and was taken into consideration during development of this notice of proposed
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal gas pipeline safety standards do not require gas pipeline operators to maintain customer-owned service
lines. In many cases, the owner of the customer-owned service line is not aware he or she is responsible for the maintenance
of the customer-owned service line or what those maintenance responsibilities are. To address these concerns, AGA's
petition, and the statutory mandate, RSPA proposes to revise &sect;192.3 to add a definition of customer-owned service
lines, and to add &sect;192.16 concerning notification requirements for customer-owned service lines to subpart
A of 49 CFR part 192. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, RSPA is proposing to apply the notification requirements to operators of petroleum gas systems covered
under &sect;192.11. Thus, for the purpose of this discussion, the word ``operator'' will apply to those operators
of natural gas and petroleum gas distribution systems that do not maintain customer-owned service lines up to the
home or building wall or to the end-use equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA is aware there are situations where the meter is adjacent to, but not at, the home or building wall or the end-use
equipment. In these instances, the operator is responsible for the pipeline up to the meter, and the customer is responsible
for the small portion of buried pipeline from the outlet of the meter to the home or building wall or to the end-use equipment.
At this time, RSPA is proposing to apply the notification requirements to these sections of pipeline when the operator
does not voluntarily maintain these sections of pipeline. RSPA invites public comment on whether these short sections
of customer-owned service line have been properly installed and whether they are periodically maintained. RSPA
believes that some of these sections were installed and are voluntarily maintained by the operator, even though they
are the responsibility of the customer. Commenters are requested to support their responses with leak and incident
data that includes information on personal injuries, deaths, and property damages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion covers the requirements listed within section 115(a) of the Act and how RSPA proposes to
address them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Maintenance Requirements for Customer-Owned Service Lines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RSPA requires operator-owned service lines to be operated and maintained to 49 CFR part 192 standards. These pipeline
safety standards include leak detection surveys and corrosion control. Subpart I details the requirements for corrosion
control, and subpart M details leak detection surveys and other maintenance requirements. Local codes and standards
may also address operation and maintenance requirements. This notice proposes that operators provide to the owners
of customer-owned service lines general information on these safety requirements. The proposal does not require
operators to take over the maintenance of these lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, operators would be allowed to use any written means to provide actual notification of the required
information to customers. RSPA anticipates most operators will provide notice through inserts mailed to the customer
and flyers hand delivered by the meter readers.

effective service line maintenance, including information supplied by the operator. The sources referenced below
can provide general information on corrosion control and leakage surveys, and may be able to provide an actual listing
of gas distribution contractors (including plumbers) or other individuals who could perform these maintenance
requirements. The addresses and telephone numbers listed are current to the best of RSPA's knowledge.

Operation and Maintenance Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to require gas distribution operators to advise customers of any information that the operator
has concerning the operation and maintenance of its lines that could aid customers. This information could include
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Excavation damage prevention:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Excavation damage is the largest single cause of gas pipeline incidents. Section 192.614 currently requires gas
pipeline operators to notify the public in the vicinity of their pipeline on how to prevent damage to the pipeline from
excavation activities. Section 192.614 currently exempts pipelines in class 1 and 2 locations and pipelines in class
3 locations which are marked in accordance with &sect;192.707. However, in a pending rulemaking (``Excavation Damage
Prevention Programs for Gas, Hazardous Liquids and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines'', Docket 101, 53 FR 24747, June 30,
1988), RSPA has proposed removing these exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Type of pipe:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Different pipeline materials require different maintenance procedures. An operator's knowledge of the environmental
conditions affecting the service pipe connected to the customer-owned service line may assist the owner in the maintenance
of the customer-owned service line.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Age of the pipe:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The installation date of customer-owned service lines, installed by individuals other than the operator, may not
be known. However, many operators will have a record of the date gas service was initially established to the customer.
In such cases, operators may reasonably assume that the installation date of the customer-owned service line is approximately
the date of initial gas service. This information may then be relayed to the customer to assist in estimating the condition
of the pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Potential Hazards:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice proposes to require an operator to inform customers of the potential hazards of not maintaining a customer-owned
service line. Improper maintenance or lack of periodic maintenance of customer-owned service lines may result in
corrosion of metallic pipeline materials, separation of piping components, gas leaks, property damage, environmental
damage, personal injury, and even death.

This proposed rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
and, therefore, was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant
under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).
A regulatory evaluation is available for review in the docket.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism''),
and does not have sufficient federalism impacts to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would apply to operators of natural gas and petroleum gas distribution systems. Small gas distribution
systems are characterized in this proposal as distribution systems serving fewer than 10,000 customers. They include
master meter systems, which usually serve mobile home parks, housing projects and apartment complexes, and public,
private, and municipal natural gas distribution systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Master meter systems, as defined in &sect;191.3, are pipeline systems for distributing gas within, but not limited
to, a definable area, such as a mobile home park, housing project, or apartment complex, where the operator purchases
metered gas from an outside source for resale through a gas distribution system. The gas distribution pipeline system
supplies the ultimate consumer who either purchases the gas directly through a meter or by other means, such as by rents.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RSPA has determined that master meter operators will not be affected by this notice of proposed rulemaking because
the master meter operator generally owns the complete gas distribution system. Thus, the master meter operator is
responsible for the pipeline from the point of purchase to the ultimate customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft regulatory evaluation has been prepared to determine the economic impact of this proposed rule on public,
private, and municipal gas distribution systems. Based on the facts available, I certify that this proposal will
not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification
is subject to modification as a result of a review of comments received in response to this proposal.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a notice to withdraw the advance notice of proposed rulemaking of
October 13, 1983 (48 FR 46694) that would have established conditions under which over-the-counter (OTC) vaginal
drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. FDA is issuing this notice of withdrawal
after considering the report and recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Contraceptives and Other Vaginal
Drug Products (the Vaginal Panel) and public comments on an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that was based on
those recommendations. This action is being taken in part because the agency has determined that some of the recommended
labeling indications relate to cosmetic claims and not drug claims. In addition, recommended labeling indications
and ingredients used for minor irritation, itching, or soreness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not unique to the vaginal area and are already being considered in other OTC drug rulemakings (e.g., antifungal,
antimicrobial, and external analgesic). Therefore, those ingredients and indications will be considered in those
other rulemakings, as appropriate.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 13, 1983 (48 FR 46694), FDA published, under &sect;330.10(a)(6) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(6)), an advance notice
of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for OTC vaginal drug products, together with the recommendations
of the Vaginal Panel, which was the advisory review panel responsible for evaluating data on the active ingredients
in this drug class. Interested persons were invited to submit comments by January 11, 1984. Reply comments in response
to comments filed in the initial comment period could be submitted by March 19, 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with &sect;330.10(a)(10), the data and information considered by the Vaginal Panel were put on public
display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn
Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In this notice, FDA states for the first time its position on the establishment of a monograph for OTC vaginal drug products
based on the Vaginal Panel's conclusions and recommendations on OTC vaginal drug products, the comments received,
and the agency's independent evaluation of the Vaginal Panel's report. In the preamble to the advance notice of proposed
rulemaking for OTC vaginal drug products (48 FR 46694 at 46695), the agency expressed its concerns about: (1) The ability
of a woman to recognize the nature or cause of the symptom(s) of vaginal itching, irritation, or soreness in order to
determine which kind of drug product to select to treat the condition, and (2) whether 1 to 2 weeks of self-medicating
with an OTC drug product may pose an unacceptable delay in seeking professional attention if the symptom(s) of itching,
irritation, or soreness are due to

, or other organisms that will not be eradicated by topical therapy with nonantimicrobial OTC drug products. At that
time, no final agency decisions were made regarding the Vaginal Panel's recommendations or the above stated concerns.
The agency invited specific comments on these issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, four drug manufacturers, two trade associations, nine
consumers, four medical associations, two pharmaceutical associations, three surgeons general, one poison control
center, three consumer groups, two community health associations, and three practicing medical groups submitted
comments. Copies of the comments received are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch (address above).

 A. General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1. One comment contended that OTC drug monographs are interpretive, as opposed to substantive, regulations. The
comment referred to statements on this issue submitted earlier to other OTC drug rulemaking proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency addressed this issue in paragraphs 85 through 91 of the preamble to the procedures for classification of
OTC drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 11, 1972 (37 FR 9464 at 9471 to 9472), and in paragraph 3 of the preamble to the tentative final monograph for OTC
antacid drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 12, 1973 (38 FR 31260). FDA reaffirms the conclusions stated in those documents. Court decisions have
confirmed the agency's authority to issue substantive regulations by rulemaking. (See, e.g.,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. One comment disagreed with the Vaginal Panel's statement that ``If an active ingredient is present in a therapeutic
concentration, the product is a drug, even if that product does not claim to produce the effect which will result from
the action of the therapeutically effective ingredient * * *,'' (48 FR 46694 at 46701). The comment argued that drug
status of a product is determined only by its intended use, not by the inclusion of certain ingredients, and the presence
of a certain ingredient in a product offered solely as a cosmetic does not make the product a drug. The comment stated
that FDA's policy concerning drug versus cosmetic status has been stated in many documents, including the procedural
regulations governing the OTC drug review (37 FR 9464 to 9475), and that the Vaginal Panel did not properly apply this
policy. The comment added that there is no justification to apply a different principle to this rulemaking for vaginal
drug products. The comment requested that the term ``drug product'' be used throughout the regulation wherever products
are specifically identified to emphasize the difference between cosmetic and drug products, e.g., vaginal douche
drug products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) provides the statutory definitions that differentiate a drug from
a cosmetic. A ``drug'' is defined in part as an article ``intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment,
or prevention of disease'' or ``intended to affect the structure or any function of the body * * *.'' (See 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)
and (C).) A ``cosmetic,'' on the other hand, is defined as an article intended to be ``* * * applied to the human body or
any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance, * * *.'' (See
21 U.S.C. 321(i)(1).) Therefore, the agency agrees with the comment that the intended use of a product is the primary
determining factor as to whether a product is a drug, a cosmetic, or both. This intended use may be inferred from the
product's labeling, promotional material, advertising, and any other relevant factor. See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Nutritional Foods Ass'n
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mathews
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 557 F.2d 325, 334 (2d Cir. 1977).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The type and amount of ingredient(s) present in a product, even if that product does not make explicit drug claims,
must be considered in determining its regulatory status. For example, the mere presence of a pharmacologically active
ingredient could make a product a drug even in the absence of explicit drug claims. In these cases, the intended use
would be implied because of the known or recognized drug effects of the ingredient (e.g., fluoride in a dentifrice).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency does not believe that it is necessary to use the term ``drug product'' throughout OTC drug monographs to
distinguish between drug and cosmetic products because the labeling in final monographs applies only to products
that fall within the statutory definition of a drug, and does not apply to cosmetic products. However, if a product
is intended for both drug and cosmetic uses, e.g., cleansing and treating a disease condition, it must conform to the
requirements of the applicable final monograph(s) for OTC drug products, as well as bear appropriate labeling for
cosmetic use in conformity with section 602 of the act (21 U.S.C. 362) and the provisions of parts 701 and 740 (21 CFR
parts 701 and 740).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 3. In response to the agency's specific request for comment on the appropriateness of OTC drug products for treating
the symptoms of itching, irritation, and soreness in or around the vagina (48 FR 46694 at 46695), several comments
stated that treating these symptoms with OTC drug products is appropriate and rational therapy because women can
readily recognize these symptoms and the benefits to be derived from the use of these drugs far outweigh any risks associated
with their OTC availability. A number of comments stated that there is no valid medical basis to conclude, as was suggested
by FDA in the preamble of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC topical antifungal drug products (47 FR
12480, March 23, 1982), that a serious health hazard could result from self-treating the symptom of external feminine
itching. The comments contended that the likelihood of masking more serious gynecological disorders such as gonorrhea
or trichomoniasis, or masking a more serious condition such as diabetes, was highly unlikely provided the labeling
of the products advises consumers to consult a physician if symptoms worsen or persist for longer than 1 week. To further
support its contention that serious complications or delays in proper medical diagnosis are not likely to occur if
the symptoms of external vaginal itching are treated with OTC drug products, one comment cited the safe marketing
experience of OTC hydrocortisone products labeled with an indication that included ``external genital (feminine)
itching.'' The comment stated that none of the possible problems projected, i.e., the masking of serious disease,
the inability to self-diagnose, and the presumed side effects of the drug, had materialized since the marketing of
OTC hydrocortisone began in 1979. Several comments also argued that external vaginal itching and irritation are
not necessarily caused by infection, but can often be caused by irritating clothing, sensitivities to cosmetics,
inappropriate hygiene, or other external factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In contrast, several comments stated that women should never self-treat the symptoms of vaginal itching, irritation,
or soreness because they are not capable of self-diagnosis (i.e., specifically determining an appropriate drug
product to use based on various vaginal symptoms) and should always be evaluated by a physician. The comments added
that self-treatment could unreasonably delay a proper diagnosis and could even complicate it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency notes that all of the products submitted to the Vaginal Panel were intended for intravaginal use and with
the exception of vaginal contraceptives, the use of these OTC vaginal products, e.g., douches, suppositories, had
been for the most part limited to cosmetic purposes, e.g., cleansing, deodorizing, mechanical flushing. Thus, the
agency concludes that with the exception of indications relating to minor itching, irritation, and soreness, all
other recommended vaginal monograph indications listed in the Vaginal Panel's report (48 FR 46694 at 46729) are cosmetic
in nature or outside the scope of the OTC drug review, e.g., ``Astringent,'' ``Removes vaginal discharge,'' ``Removes
vaginal secretions,'' ``Mild detergent action.'' Such indications for vaginal products refer to a product's transitory
cleansing effects rather than to claimed therapeutic effects. (See drug/cosmetic discussion in comment 2.) Therefore,
except for some ``astringent'' claims (see comment 13), the agency considers these indications outside the scope
of the OTC drug review. The agency has no objection to the continued availability of vaginal products bearing labeling
claims related to cleansing for cosmetic purposes, but does not believe that these cosmetic products should be labeled
or used for therapeutic purposes except under the advice and supervision of a physician. As a result of this withdrawal
notice, manufacturers may need to relabel or reformulate some products now or in the future. However, if reformulation
and/or relabeling are necessary, the cost will be minimal because reformulation and relabeling will be required,
in any event, under other appropriate rulemakings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency believes that consumers should have access to OTC drug products to provide temporary relief of vaginal
itching and irritation. The agency recognizes that the safe marketing experience of hydrocortisone, which has been
available OTC since 1979 with an indication that includes use on itchy anal and genital areas, provides support that
serious complications or delays in proper medical diagnosis are not likely to occur if the symptom of vaginal itching
is treated with OTC drug products. Therefore, based on the available data and information, the agency believes that
the relief of vaginal symptoms such as itching and irritation is an acceptable labeling claim for certain OTC drug
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As stated above, all of the products submitted to the Vaginal Panel were intended for intravaginal use and concerns
arose about self-diagnosis, selection of an appropriate drug product, and self-treatment of intravaginal disorders.
The Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee (the Committee), in a meeting held June 14 and 15, 1990,
discussed the proposal that vaginal fungicides be sold OTC for the treatment of yeast (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Candida
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) infections. Although a mechanism for initial self-diagnosis was not considered, the Committee believed that consumers
could safely and adequately recognize and treat subsequent intravaginal yeast infections after an initial diagnosis
had been made by a physician and recommended that vaginal antifungal drug products whose safety was well-established
be made available OTC with appropriate labeling (Ref. 1). Based on the Committee's recommendations and other available
data, the agency has determined that certain OTC drug products for intravaginal use to treat yeast infections or for
the relief of minor irritation, itching, and soreness can be safely used OTC. However, as recommended above, the agency
believes that antifungal or other drug product ingredients for OTC intravaginal use are appropriate only for those
women who have previously been diagnosed by a physician as having had the condition for which these drug products are
intended and are therefore able to subsequently recognize the symptoms of the condition. The agency intends to discuss
proposed labeling and specific ingredients for OTC intravaginal use in an amendment to the final monograph for OTC
antifungal drug products in a future issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 While a number of ingredients in OTC drug products could be used in and around the vagina to relieve symptoms such as
itching, irritation, or soreness, the use of these ingredients is not specific or unique to the vaginal area; i.e.,
they could be used topically to relieve these same symptoms elsewhere on the body. For example, antifungals, antipruritics,
skin protectants, and astringents all have potential for relieving symptoms occurring externally around the vagina
as well as on other parts of the body. It should be noted, however, that certain drug product classes, e.g., antifungals,
may be capable of relieving itching and irritation by means of killing the cause of the itch (e.g., yeast/fungus).
These products would not be expected to be routinely effective in treating ``itch'' due to other causes, e.g., poison
ivy, eczema, insect bites, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, in other OTC drug rulemakings, the agency has included, where appropriate, the various conditions for which
an ingredient is considered generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC use in one monograph. (See, for example,
the discussion on hydrocortisone for use in psoriasis (51 FR 27346 at 27360) and the discussion on menstrual claims
for internal analgesics (53 FR 46204 at 46209).) Therefore, for those ingredients that are considered safe and effective
for use in relieving conditions in and around the vagina, the agency believes it is more appropriate to include a vaginal
claim in the applicable OTC drug monograph rather than to have a separate monograph for ingredients and claims related
to vaginal use only. (See, for example, ``external feminine itching'' claims for hydrocortisone products included
in the tentative final monograph for OTC external analgesic drug products (48 FR 5852 at 5868).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Therefore, based on the discussion above, the agency is withdrawing the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for
OTC vaginal drug products, which indicated the intention to create new subpart B of proposed part 351. This withdrawal
reflects the agency's intention regarding the language previously published for potential codification in part
351, but does not negate or reject the advisory panel's report. Specific vaginal claims for the various pharmacologic
classes of ingredients will be considered in other appropriate monographs. Because the issues raised by the comments
may significantly affect these other OTC drug rulemakings, the agency believes it is useful to respond to these issues
in this document. These issues and the agency's response to them will also be discussed in other appropriate OTC drug
rulemakings. Interested persons may, at that time, submit comments to the applicable rulemakings.

 4. Several comments supported the recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Antimicrobial II Drug Products
(the Antimicrobial II Panel) that proposed a prescription to OTC switch of certain topical antifungal drugs for treating
external feminine itching associated with a yeast infection (47 FR 12480). These comments stressed that candidal
(yeast) infections of the vagina are extremely common and recurrent and that women can recognize with reasonable
certainty when they have a yeast infection, especially if they have had one before.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency is aware that all three OTC advisory review panels charged with reviewing products that could be used in
or around the vagina concluded that vaginal infections could not be self-diagnosed or self-treated. The panels'
conclusions are consistent with FDA policy that infections in general should not be self-diagnosed by consumers
or self-treated with OTC drug products. The only exception to this general policy is the OTC use of topical antifungals
for treating athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. The Antimicrobial II Panel that reviewed topical antifungal
drug products and FDA have determined that these infections are so common and recurrent that they are amenable to self-diagnosis
and treatment. In addition, the Antimicrobial II Panel recommended that haloprogin, miconazole, and nystatin be
switched from prescription to OTC status for external feminine itching associated with a yeast infection. The Antimicrobial
II Panel did not recommend these ingredients for treatment of the infection itself, but believed that OTC availability
of these ingredients would be beneficial in providing rapid symptomatic relief of itching. The issue of consumer
diagnosis of recurrent infections after appropriate physician diagnosis of the initial infection was not discussed
during any of the panels' consideration of this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Antimicrobial II Panel also recommended that haloprogin, miconazole, and nystatin be available OTC for the treatment
of superficial skin infections caused by yeast (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Candida
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (47 FR 12480 at 12565) However, the agency concluded in the tentative final monograph for OTC antifungal drug products
(54 FR 51136 at 51140) that no antifungal ingredient should be labeled for OTC use for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis.
However, the agency stated that cutaneous candidiasis claims for effective antifungal ingredients could appropriately
be included in professional labeling. As stated in comment 3, in light of the recommendations of the Committee, the
agency has reevaluated its position on the availability of antifungal drug products for OTC treatment of vaginal
yeast (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Candida
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) infections. The antifungal ingredients clotrimazole and miconazole nitrate, at specific concentrations, have
been approved for OTC intravaginal use, for specific indications, under new drug applications (Refs. 1 and 2).

 5. One comment disagreed with the Vaginal Panel's recommendation that ingredients classified as Category II for
use in OTC vaginal drug products be removed automatically from vaginal cosmetic products (48 FR 46694 at 46710). The
comment stated that this action is unwarranted because the safety of cosmetic ingredients is assured by the manufacturers,
who consider not only the scientific analyses done by the OTC advisory panels and FDA, but also additional published
and unpublished data that may not have been reviewed by the panels. The comment also contended that the specific use
of an ingredient in a cosmetic may differ from its use in a drug product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency notes that the Vaginal Panel made this recommendation in discussing Category II combination vaginal drug
products. The Vaginal Panel recommended to the agency that any Category II ingredient that causes a combination product
to be placed in Category II for safety reasons be removed from products regardless of whether they are intended for
use as a drug or a cosmetic because of concerns about protecting consumers from unsafe ingredients. While sharing
the Vaginal Panel's concern, the agency agrees with the comment that automatic removal of Category II drug ingredients
from cosmetic products is not warranted because other factors need to be considered. For example, while an ingredient
may not be safe in one concentration for use as a drug, it may be acceptable for use at a lower concentration in a cosmetic
product. However, the agency will look carefully at any ingredients that are present in cosmetic products when those
ingredients have been found unsafe for use in OTC drug products. FDA is prepared to take appropriate regulatory action
in preventing the use of ingredients in cosmetic products when a potential health hazard is known to exist with their
continued use. (See 21 CFR part 700_subpart B.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 6. One comment stated that the Vaginal Panel ``may have inappropriately suggested the need for effectiveness testing
for vaginal drug product final formulations'' (48 FR 46694 at 46724 and 46725). The comment stressed that the OTC drug
review is intended to be an active ingredient review and that testing is not necessary for final formulations of these
products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In discussing testing guidelines for vaginal douche products, the Vaginal Panel simply stated that it did not require
effectiveness testing for douches that make only cosmetic claims, e.g., ``cleansing.'' However, the Vaginal Panel
recommended that effectiveness testing should be required for those ingredients in vaginal douches that make drug
claims, e.g., ``relieving irritation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As discussed in comment 3, the agency is withdrawing the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC vaginal drug
products and is referring consideration of specific claims and ingredients for use in and around the vagina to other
appropriate OTC drug rulemakings. Any necessary final formulation testing will also be discussed in those rulemakings,
e.g., ingredients used in vaginal antiseptic drug products.

 7. Two comments objected to the Vaginal Panel's conclusion that data are insufficient to prove the safety of quaternary
ammonium compounds (i.e., benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and methylbenzethonium chloride) for
vaginal use (48 FR 46694 at 46717). The comments stated that although the Vaginal Panel's concern was based on published
literature reports where the use of these compounds was associated with infections caused by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it was not scientifically sound to use these reports to conclude that a safety problem exists. The comments mentioned
that the Vaginal Panel failed to state that these reports resulted from the contamination of solutions that were employed
in laboratory and hospital settings to sterilize medical devices used in urinary and cardiac catheterization or
cystoscopic or related invasive procedures. Such procedures are usually conducted on patients whose normal body
defenses have been compromised. Because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 infections occur primarily in debilitated patients and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 does not cause vulvovaginitis, the comments stated that it is scientifically inappropriate to cite these reports
and through extrapolation conclude that the use of quaternary ammonium compounds in vaginal drug products presents
a health hazard to normal individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The comments cited several references (Refs. 1 through 7) to show that the Vaginal Panel's concerns with respect to
vaginal contamination by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the presence of quaternary ammonium compounds are not supported by the weight of scientific data. The comments
added that extensive toxicological studies on these compounds have been published (Ref. 8). The comments requested
the agency to affirm the safety of quaternary ammonium compounds and classify them as Category I for use in relieving
minor irritations of the vagina.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Another comment stated that quaternary ammonium compounds historically have been included in vaginal products
as preservatives and that these ingredients should be allowed to continue to be used for this purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency agrees with the comments' reasoning that the reports cited by the Vaginal Panel about 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 infections are not adequate to conclude that the use of quaternary ammonium compounds in OTC vaginal drug products
may present a health hazard to normal individuals. The agency has no objection to the continued use of quaternary ammonium
compounds as preservatives in OTC drug and cosmetic products provided the products are manufactured in accordance
with established procedures that assure the adequacy of preservative systems and microbial limits of products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 With respect to the use of quaternary ammonium compounds as active ingredients in OTC vaginal drug products for relieving
symptoms of itching, irritation, or soreness, the Vaginal Panel stated that it was unaware of any data that demonstrated
effectiveness for these uses (48 FR 46694 at 46718). The comments did not include any new data, and the agency is unaware
of any such data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As explained in comment 3, the agency has decided to consider specific vaginal claims for the various ingredients
in other appropriate rulemakings. Quaternary ammonium compounds are included as Category I ingredients in the tentative
final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644). Any comments or new data received regarding specific vaginal use of quaternary ammonium
compounds will be considered by the agency in the rulemaking for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products.

 8. One comment supported the Vaginal Panel's Category I classification of potassium sorbate (48 FR 46694 at 46704)
and disagreed with the agency's conclusion that potassium sorbate is a new drug because it has not been marketed as
a drug to a material extent and for a material time in the United States (48 FR 46694 at 46695). The comment stated that
a product containing potassium sorbate had been marketed for over 2 years and that this ingredient is generally recognized
as safe and effective for the treatment of minor vaginal itching and irritation and should be included as a monograph
ingredient. The comment contended that potassium sorbate is safe because it was so recognized by the Vaginal Panel,
and because of the lack of ``any report of major side effects, adverse reaction or complaint'' while 14 million units
of a product containing this ingredient were sold for over 2 years before marketing was discontinued. The comment
argued that potassium sorbate is effective because it was so recognized by the Vaginal Panel based on two adequate
and well-controlled clinical studies (48 FR 46694 at 46704). The comment added that this ingredient has been historically
used by physicians for treatment of vaginal itching and irritation, and that this professional use constitutes use
``for a material time and to a material extent.'' The comment also argued that potassium sorbate is safer than povidone-iodine,
which the Vaginal Panel recommended as a Category I ingredient for these uses. The comment concluded that potassium
sorbate is not a new drug because of its historical use and because of its marketing history, and should be placed in
Category I as a monograph ingredient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In the preamble to the Vaginal Panel's report (48 FR 46694 at 46695), the agency stated its opinion as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The agency is not aware of the marketing of any drug product containing potassium sorbate as an active ingredient prior
to adoption of the Panel's report, although at least one product has entered the marketplace since that time. Because
potassium sorbate has not been marketed as a drug to a material extent and for a material time in the United States, the
agency considers this ingredient to be a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)). It may not be marketed until FDA has approved a new drug application (NDA) for such
use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The agency has not at this time changed its position on potassium sorbate for the treatment of minor vaginal itching
and irritation. However, issues about the agency's interpretations regarding marketing to a ``material extent''
and for a ``material time'' as threshold criteria for inclusion of an ingredient in the OTC drug review have been raised
in a number of rulemakings. Citizen petitions (Refs. 1 and 2) have been filed requesting the agency to change its longstanding
position on these threshold criteria, especially with regard to permitting foreign marketing to satisfy the material
time and extent criteria. The agency intends to address the material time and extent issues in a consolidated response
in a future issue of the

 9. One comment requested that Category I approval of povidone-iodine as an active ingredient for the relief of minor
irritations of the vagina be extended to include a vaginal suppository as well as a douche dosage form. The comment
stated that the absorption potential with a suppository dosage form should be no greater than with a vaginal douche,
and that there is no basis for making a distinction between a suppository and a douche dosage form with respect to effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In response to a comment comparing the relative safety of potassium sorbate to povidone-iodine (see comment 8), one
comment contended that the safety and effectiveness questions raised by the other comment with respect to povidone-iodine
were superficial and erroneous and were in disregard of the facts. The comment stated that over 1,000 published studies
and over 30 years of experience demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of povidone-iodine and confirm its Category
I status for vaginal use as a douche.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Povidone-iodine in various formulations for vaginal use, i.e., douche and gel, was originally reviewed under the
FDA Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI). The DESI panel concluded that povidone-iodine was effective as a
douche, i.e., for cleansing purposes, and that povidone-iodine could offer some partial or temporary relief of itching
and odor when infection was present. Only the douche formulation was deferred for consideration to the OTC drug review.
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 13, 1983 (48 FR 46694 at 46705), the Vaginal Panel reviewed the povidone-iodine douche product (0.15 to
3 percent) and placed it in Category I for the relief of minor irritations of the vagina. The Vaginal Panel did not review
povidone-iodine in a suppository dosage form because no data on this dosage form were submitted. However, the Vaginal
Panel did consider the suppository dosage form for claims relating to relief of minor irritation, and reduction of
number of pathogenic microorganisms, and stated that such claims must be substantiated by testing (48 FR 46694 at
46702). The safety and effectiveness of povidone-iodine for the relief of itching and minor irritation in and around
the vagina will be discussed by the agency in the rulemaking for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products in a future
issue of the

 10. One comment objected to the Vaginal Panel's recommendation that OTC drugs be labeled with the components of perfumes
that are included in the products. The comment explained that fragrances and flavors are often made up of dozens of
ingredients and that to list each of these individually would be a practical impossibility; furthermore, the composition
of a perfume is a significant trade secret. The comment pointed out that this issue had been considered and rejected
by Congress and FDA on several occasions over the past decade, and concluded that there was no reason whatsoever to
change these previous decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Because section 502(e) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(e)) specifies the requirements for the labeling of active and inactive
ingredients in drug products, there is no need to include such requirements in an OTC drug monograph. However, the
agency notes that although section 502(e) of the act does not require the complete identification of all inactive
ingredients in the labeling of OTC drugs, it does require the disclosure of certain ingredients, whether included
as active or inactive components in a drug product. Although FDA does not require the inclusion of all the inactive
ingredients in OTC drug product labeling, the agency urges manufacturers to list all inactive ingredients voluntarily
as recommended by the Vaginal Panel. This information will enable the consumer with known allergies or intolerance
to certain ingredients to select products with increased confidence of safe use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 After the Vaginal Panel made its recommendations to FDA, the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA)
(formerly the Proprietary Association), the trade association that represents OTC drug manufacturers who reportedly
market 90 to 95 percent of all OTC drug products sold in the United States, implemented a program under which its member
companies voluntarily list inactive ingredients in the labeling of OTC drug products under guidelines established
by NDMA (Ref. 1). Although these guidelines do not specify the listing of each ingredient contained in the fragrance
or perfume in the product, they do provide for such inactive ingredients as flavors and fragrances to be listed as ``flavors''
and ``fragrances.'' Hence, the consumer with known allergies or intolerances to such inactive ingredients as flavors,
fragrances, or perfumes would be generally aware of their inclusion in certain OTC drug products. The agency commends
these voluntary efforts and urges all OTC drug manufacturers to label their products voluntarily in accordance with
NDMA's guidelines.

 11. Several comments argued that FDA cannot legally and should not, as a matter of policy, prescribe exclusive lists
of terms from which statements of identity and indications for use of OTC drug products must be drawn and prohibit alternative
OTC labeling terminology which is truthful, not misleading, and intelligible to the consumer to describe such indications.
Two comments argued that such a restriction is an unconstitutional restriction of commercial speech and exceeds
FDA's authority. One comment stated that this ``exclusivity policy'' is not warranted as a matter of sound public
policy, and recommended that FDA follow a guideline labeling policy instead of an exclusive one. One comment objected
that the advance notice of proposed rulemaking was more restrictive in limiting the ``statements of identity'' than
is the regulation in &sect;201.61 (21 CFR 201.61). The comment urged the agency to allow manufacturers the alternative
ways of describing the statements of identity that are allowed in &sect;201.61.

 of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258), the agency published a final rule changing its labeling policy for stating the indications
for use of OTC drug products. Under &sect;330.1(c)(2) (21 CFR 330.1(c)(2)), the label and labeling of OTC drug products
are required to contain in a prominent and conspicuous location, either: (1) The specific wording on indications
for use established under an OTC drug monograph, which may appear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES'';
(2) other wording describing such indications for use that meets the statutory prohibitions against false or misleading
labeling, which shall neither appear within a boxed area nor be designated ``APPROVED USES''; or (3) the approved
monograph language on indications, which may appear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES,'' plus alternative
language describing indications for use that is not false or misleading, which shall appear elsewhere in the labeling.
All other OTC drug labeling required by a monograph or other regulation (e.g., statement of identity, warnings, and
directions) must appear in the specific wording established under the OTC drug monograph or other regulation where
exact language has been established and identified by quotation marks, e.g., &sect;&sect;201.63 or 330.1(g).

 12. One comment stated that FDA's exclusivity policy is a drug labeling policy that has no application to cosmetic
claims appearing in the labeling of products that are both cosmetics and drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency agrees with the comment that the labeling restrictions in OTC drug monographs apply only to products that
fall within the statutory definition of ``drugs'' and not to cosmetic products. This distinction between drugs and
cosmetics is discussed in comment 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Final OTC drug monographs cover only the drug use of the active ingredients listed therein. The concentration range,
limitations, statements of identity, indications, warnings, and directions established for these ingredients
in a monograph do not apply to the use of the same ingredients in products intended solely as cosmetics. However, if
a product is intended for both drug and cosmetic use, it must conform to the requirements of the applicable final monograph(s).
In addition to any indications allowed for OTC drug products bearing claims for vaginal use, such products may also
bear appropriate labeling for cosmetic use(s), in conformity with section 602 of the act and the provisions of parts
701 and 740. In accordance with the final rule on the agency's exclusivity policy (51 FR 16258, May 1, 1986), cosmetic
claims may not appear within the boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES.'' As discussed at 51 FR 16258 at 16264 (paragraph
14), cosmetic claims may appear elsewhere in the labeling but not in the box should manufacturers choose the labeling
alternative provided in &sect;330.1(c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(iii) for labeling cosmetic drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 13. One comment agreed with the Vaginal Panel's conclusions that the terms ``cleansing,'' ``producing soothing
and refreshing effects,'' and ``deodorizing'' (as used in the definitions of vaginal douche and vaginal suppository)
are cosmetic claims (48 FR 46694 at 46701). The comment urged the agency to accept the Vaginal Panel's recommendation.
In addition to the claims above, another comment also considered the claim ``producing an astringent effect'' to
be a cosmetic claim. The comment argued that these claims do not make a vaginal product into a drug, that it is legally
inappropriate to include them in the definitions of these products in proposed &sect;351.103 of the monograph, and
that they should be removed from the definitions section and anywhere else they appear in the document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency agrees that cosmetic claims should not be included in OTC drug rulemakings. Therefore, the cosmetic claims
``cleansing,'' ``soothing,'' ``refreshing,'' and ``deodorizing'' will not be included in OTC drug monographs.
The agency believes, however, that astringency can be either a drug claim or a cosmetic claim, depending on the intended
use and labeling of the product. For example, astringent products intended and labeled for the relief of minor vaginal
irritation or reduction in local edema would be considered as drugs, while astringent products intended and labeled
for a refreshing effect would be considered as cosmetics. A product making both claims would be both a drug and a cosmetic.
Thus, the agency will consider the intended use in determining whether it is a cosmetic, a drug, or both (see also comment
3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 14. One comment stated that the Vaginal Panel's categorization of cosmetic claims as Category II drug claims is inappropriate
because cosmetic claims are not within the jurisdiction of the OTC drug review. The comment contended that the following
claims were inappropriately classified as Category II drug claims by the Vaginal Panel (48 FR 46694 at 46710) because
these claims are really cosmetic claims:

 Stating that the Vaginal Panel did not provide a reason for its recommendation, the comment requested that reference
to these claims be deleted at the next stage of the rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although there will not be another stage in this rulemaking, the comment's concerns regarding these label terms are
relevant to vaginal claims for OTC drug products subject to other OTC drug monographs. Therefore, the agency believes
it is pertinent to address the comment's concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The OTC drug review establishes conditions under which some OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective
and not misbranded. Two principal conditions examined during the review are allowable ingredients and allowable
labeling. FDA has determined that it is not practical_in terms of time, resources, and other considerations_to set
standards for all labeling found in OTC drug products. Accordingly, OTC drug monographs regulate only labeling related
in a significant way to the safe and effective use of covered products by lay persons. OTC drug monographs establish
allowable labeling for the following items: product statement of identity; names of active ingredients; indications
for use; directions for use; warnings against unsafe use, side effects, and adverse reactions; and claims concerning
mechanism of drug action. The agency agrees with the comment that some of the claims listed above are either solely
cosmetic claims or do not relate in a significant way to the safe and effective use of OTC vaginal drug products and,
therefore, are outside the scope of the OTC drug review. Although these terms are considered outside the scope of the
review, if used in the labeling of OTC drug products they will be evaluated by the agency on a product-by-product basis,
under the provision of section 502 of the act relating to labeling that is false or misleading. Moreover, any term that
is outside the scope of the review, even though it is truthful and not misleading, may not appear in any portion of the
labeling required by a monograph and may not detract from such required information. However, terms outside the scope
of a monograph may be included elsewhere in the labeling, provided they are not false or misleading. In addition, as
explained in comment 2, the labeling restrictions in final monographs apply only to products that fall within the
statutory definition of a drug, and not to cosmetic products. However, if a product is intended for both drug and cosmetic
use, it must conform not only to the requirements of the applicable final monographs, but also to section 602 of the
act and the regulations in parts 701 and 740.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 15. One comment contended that the use of the adjective ``vaginal'' modifying ``douche'' in the statement of identity
in &sect;351.152(a) is unnecessary and superfluous because, in common language usage, the word ``douche'' has become
synonymous with vaginal use. The comment added that the agency has codified this class of products as ``douche preparations''
in 21 CFR 369.20. The comment requested that the statement of identity allow for synonyms for ``vaginal douche'' such
as ``feminine douche,'' ``disposable douche,'' and ``douche.'' The comment argued that the term ``vaginal douche''
may be too sensitive for certain advertising media and that the requested synonyms plus the accompanying labeling
would clearly define the product as intended for vaginal use only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency recognizes the sensitivity to use of the word ``vaginal'' and will take this into consideration in developing
labeling in the appropriate OTC drug monographs. (See, e.g., the labeling developed for hydrocortisone in the tentative
final monograph for OTC external analgesic drug products (48 FR 5852 at 5868).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 16. One comment objected to the Vaginal Panel's recommendation in proposed &sect;351.152(b) that the two statements
``Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children'' and ``DOES NOT PREVENT PREGNANCY'' appear on the principal
display panel of OTC vaginal drug products. The comment argued that including such statements on the principal display
panel is contrary to labeling requirements in other OTC drug regulations now in effect in that statements such as these
are generally required to be displayed in a warnings section next to the directions for use. The comment further argued
that vaginal douche products have not been shown less safe than or different from other OTC drug products to the extent
that would necessitate inclusion of separate warning statements. The comment requested that the Vaginal Panel's
recommended that proposed &sect;351.152(b) be deleted and that these statements be included with the recommended
label warnings in proposed &sect;351.154(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency agrees with the comment that special placement of these warning statements on the principal display panel
is unwarranted. The Vaginal Panel recommended that the statement ``Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children''
appear on the principal display panel because the attractiveness and colorful appearance of many vaginal drug products
may encourage children to open and consume the contents (48 FR 46694 at 46708). The agency is unaware of any evidence
that OTC vaginal drug products are any more attractive or more likely to be opened and consumed by children than other
OTC drug products. Therefore, the agency has determined that there is no need for special placement of this general
warning statement in the labeling of OTC vaginal drug products. Because existing regulations in &sect;330.1(g)
(21 CFR 330.1(g)) already require all OTC drugs to contain the warning ``Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children,''
there is no need to include this warning in individual OTC drug monographs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 However, because the Vaginal Panel was concerned that there is a commonly held misconception by some people that douching
prevents pregnancy (48 FR 46694 at 46708), the agency encourages manufacturers to voluntarily place the warning
``DOES NOT PREVENT PREGNANCY'' in the labeling of vaginal douche products. The agency will discuss vaginal drug product
labeling regarding prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases as part of the rulemaking for OTC antifungal
drug products in a future issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 17. One comment urged deletion of the Vaginal Panel's recommended professional labeling statement in proposed &sect;351.180(b)(3),
which reads: ``The use of povidone-iodine as a douche may cause a transient rise of serum protein-bound iodine.''
The comment argued that in view of the Vaginal Panel's conclusion that a transient rise in serum protein-bound iodine
levels (observed in some individuals) does not affect the safety of the drug and has not been shown to have clinical
significance with respect to thyroid function (48 FR 46694 at 46705), the statement is unwarranted. The comment added
that inclusion of such a statement in professional labeling is misleading because it directs unwarranted emphasis
to an essentially meaningless event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The comment also stated that if the agency decides not to delete this statement, the statement should be amended to
read as follows: ``While not affecting its safety, the use of povidone-iodine as a douche may cause a transient rise
in serum protein-bound iodine in some individuals. Such transient elevation returns to normal within 7 to 30 days
and there is no evidence that this has clinical significance with respect to thyroid function.'' The comment contended
that this revised statement would present the full clinical significance of the rise in serum protein-bound iodine
according to the Vaginal Panel's stated findings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As discussed in comment 9, the agency intends to consider povidone-iodine for vaginal use in the rulemaking for OTC
topical antimicrobial drug products in a future issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the tentative final monographs in which povidone-iodine is a Category I ingredient (antifungal (54 FR 51136,
December 12, 1989) and first aid antiseptic (56 FR 33644, July 22, 1991)), a statement regarding the transient rise
in protein-bound iodine associated with the use of povidone-iodine has not been included in professional labeling.
Any other professional labeling associated with vaginal use of povidone-iodine will be considered as part of the
antimicrobial rulemaking and will not be further considered here.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
 D. Comments on Combinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 18. One comment requested that the Vaginal Panel's recommended list of permitted combinations in proposed &sect;351.120
be amended to provide for combinations of one Category I ingredient from any two, three, or four of the various pharmacologic
classes. The comment stated that there is adequate precedent in the OTC drug review for combining Category I ingredients
from one pharmacological class with Category I ingredients from another pharmacological class, without the necessity
of elaborate testing of the combination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As explained in comment 3, the agency is withdrawing the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC vaginal drug
products and is referring consideration of specific vaginal claims to other appropriate OTC drug rulemakings. Likewise,
combinations of ingredients for vaginal claims will be considered in those respective rulemakings and will not be
considered here.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 19. The agency recognizes that the Vaginal Panel recommended some professional labeling indications for several
of the ingredients it reviewed. (See Proposed &sect;351.180, 48 FR 46694 at 46729.) For a combination product containing
the ingredients dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (docusate sodium) and sodium lauryl sulfate, the Vaginal Panel recommended
the indication ``For the treatment of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trichomonas vaginalis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' For a combination product containing the ingredients calcium propionate and sodium propionate, the Vaginal
Panel recommended the indication ``For the treatment of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Candida albicans
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' For the ingredient povidone-iodine, the Vaginal Panel recommended the indication ``Clinically effective in
a program of treatment for vaginal moniliasis, T-vaginales vaginitis, and nonspecific vaginitis.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In the preamble to the Vaginal Panel's report (48 FR 46694 at 46695), the agency disagreed with the Vaginal Panel's
recommendations regarding calcium propionate and sodium propionate. Based on previous decisions made by the agency
with respect to these ingredients under the DESI program, the agency placed the professional labeling indication
recommended by the Vaginal Panel for calcium propionate and sodium propionate in Category II. The agency reaffirms
that categorization in this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency also stated in the preamble to the Vaginal Panel's report that OTC marketing of these ingredients for the
relief of minor vaginal irritations could not take place at that time because the studies relied upon by the Panel were
the same as those reviewed by the agency and found to be inadequate under DESI. The agency invited comment and data that
would support the Panel's recommendations on the safety and effectiveness of calcium propionate and sodium propionate
as ingredients in OTC vaginal drug products. No comments or new data were submitted. Therefore, the agency is reaffirming
its conclusions that these ingredients, singly or in combination, may not be marketed in OTC drug products with claims
for vaginal use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In recommending a professional labeling claim for docusate sodium and sodium lauryl sulfate, the Panel relied upon
one published study (Ref. 1) to support its recommendation. The agency has evaluated this study and finds that it is
insufficient to determine the safety and effectiveness of these ingredients for the treatment of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trichomonas vaginalis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The study does not satisfy the criteria for an adequate and well-controlled clinical study because it did not include
a control group. In addition, it was not designed to determine the effect of these ingredients in treating 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trichomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 but rather to determine the effect of pH on the removal of secretions from the vagina. Therefore, these ingredients,
singly or in combination, may not be marketed in OTC drug products with claims (including professional labeling claims)
for vaginal use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Regarding the active ingredient povidone-iodine, the Panel (48 FR 46694 at 46705) stated that adequate data supported
a claim of effectiveness against vaginal yeast (candidiasis or moniliasis), T-vaginales vaginitis and nonspecific
vaginitis, but only when used in a treatment regimen consisting of the diluted douche and the full strength (10 percent)
povidone-iodine products. Because the Vaginal Panel (48 FR 46694 at 46700) believed that claims of therapeutic benefit
for treatment of specific vaginal infections must be restricted to professional labeling, e.g., for the treatment
of trichomoniasis or moniliasis, labeling for the full strength (10 percent) product was not included in the monograph.
However, the agency has since concluded that recurring vaginal yeast (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Candida
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) infections can be safely treated OTC. The agency is currently reviewing the data the Vaginal Panel considered as
well as a subsequent petition filed in support of various vaginal claims and formulations for povidone-iodine (Ref.
4). The agency will discuss the use of povidone-iodine for the treatment of vaginal yeast (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Candida
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) infections in a future 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication as part of the rulemaking for OTC antifungal drug products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two clinical studies were cited in the data submission to the OTC drug review to support the vaginitis claim (Refs.
2 and 3). The agency has reviewed the two clinical studies and has concluded that they are insufficient to demonstrate
that povidone-iodine is effective in the treatment of vaginitis. Neither study satisfies the criteria for adequate
and well-controlled studies because a control group was not included. Therefore, they are insufficient to demonstrate
the effectiveness of povidone-iodine in the treatment of vaginitis.

 II. The Agency's Conclusions on OTC Vaginal Drug Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA has considered the comments and other relevant data and information available at this time and determined that
specific claims and ingredients for use in and around the vagina will be included in other appropriate OTC drug rulemakings.
Accordingly, the advance notice of proposed rulemaking published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 13, 1983 (48 FR 46694), which would have added a new subpart B (Vaginal Drug Products for Over-the-Counter
Human Use) to proposed part 351 (Vaginal Contraceptive and Other Vaginal Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human
Use) (proposed 21 CFR part 351), is hereby withdrawn, effective February 3, 1994. As discussed above, claims that
are cosmetic claims only will not be considered in any OTC drug rulemakings. Ingredients and drug claims related to
use in and around the vagina will be considered in other appropriate OTC drug rulemakings. The agency has identified
the following rulemakings as those appropriate for consideration of ingredients and claims for vaginal drug uses:
(1) Antifungal drug products (docket No. 80N&hyph;0476), (2) external analgesic drug products (docket No. 78N&hyph;0301),
(3) skin protectant drug products (docket No. 78N&hyph;0021), and (4) topical antimicrobial drug products (Docket
No. 75N&hyph;0183). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency emphasizes that it is withdrawing only the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for these drug products
and that this withdrawal does not in any way denigrate the scientific content of the report or negate the excellent
work of the Vaginal Panel in its long efforts to produce it. FDA believes that the information in the Vaginal Panel's
report will provide valuable guidance to the agency with respect to ingredients and vaginal claims for other OTC drug
rulemakings. Further, this withdrawal of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking does not affect the current marketing
status of any of the products that were considered in the Vaginal Panel's report. This withdrawal notice is issued
under authority of secs. 201, 501, 502, 503, 505, 510, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321,
351, 352, 353, 355, 360, 371). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to make the provisions of the emergency rule listing the Pacific
pocket mouse (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus longimembris pacificus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) as an endangered species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), permanent. Although a
minimum of 8 populations of the Pacific pocket mouse encompassing 29 sites from Los Angeles County south to San Diego
County formerly occurred, the only known extant population occurs on the Dana Point Headlands in Orange County, California.
Depredation by feral and/or domestic cats and a proposed development threaten the continued existence of the remaining
population. Additional data and information, which may assist the Service in making a final decision on this proposed
action, is solicited on the status of this species.

Grand Canyon Railway, Inc., Passenger Railway Service Grand Canyon Airport to Grand Canyon Village; Availability
of Final Environmental Impact Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91&hyph;190, the Department
of Agriculture, Forest Service, and the Department of the Interior, National Park Service, joint lead agencies,
have prepared a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) and Record of Decision (ROD) on the provision of initiating
passenger rail service form Grand Canyon Airport, Tusayan, Arizona, to the Maswick Transportation Area in Grand
Canyon Village, Grand Canyon National Park.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) was circulated for public review between July 31, 1992 and September
30, 1992 (57 FR 33168) and the comment period extended to November 14, 1992. Both the DEIS and FEIS describe and analyze
a proposal and five alternatives. The proposal, Alternative A, provides for the construction of 5.4 miles of new railway
line on the national forest, with 1.1 miles on an old rail line alignment, and use of existing rail line within the national
park. One wash would need to be crossed within the airport property. Additional features are the construction of two
depots, 75 acres of parking, a road for maintenance, and the addition of storage tanks for fuel, water and wastewater.
A maximum of eight (8) trips per day would be generated between the airport and Maswick. Interpretive activities and
visitor orientation to the park and national forest would be integrated into the service. Alternatives B, C and D,
all provide for the proposed passenger service but vary in the track alignment and length to be constructed, the amount
of national forest lands needed and generally increase the number of washes that would be crossed. In addition, Alternative
D provides for a single depot. Alternative E is a non-rail alternative, utilizing a shuttle bus system in conjunction
with a parking area outside the park. Alternative F is the no action alternative. Alternative A, the proposal, is the
environmentally preferred alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 30 day no action period on the FEIS and ROD will end March 7, 1994. The ROD, as it affects National Forest System Lands,
is subject to appeal in accordance with 36 CFR part 217. A notice of appeal must be in writing and clearly state that it
is a Notice of Appeal being filed pursuant to 36 CFR part 217. Appeals must be filed with the Regional Forester, Southwestern
Region, 517 Gold Avenue SW., Albuquerque, NM 87102&hyph;0094 within 45 days of legal notice of this decision in the
Arizona Daily Sun. While The National Park Service has no formal appeal process, no implementation of the proposal
within Grand Canyon National Park will occur before expiration of the 30 day no action period and contingent on any
appeals received pertaining to National Forest System lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for additional information and/or copies of the FEIS and ROD should be directed to the Forest Supervisor,
Kaibab National Forest, 800 South State Street, Williams, AZ 86048, telephone number 602&hyph;635&hyph;2681,
or to the Superintendent, Grand Canyon National Park, P.O. Box 129, Grand Canyon National Park, AZ 86023, telephone
number 602&hyph;638&hyph;7701.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the FEIS and ROD are available for inspection at the park headquarters, Forest Supervisor's office, and
libraries at Flagstaff, Williams, Northern Arizona University, and Arizona State University. Copies are also available
at the following addresses: Western Regional Office, National Park Service, Attn: Division of Planning, Grants

Proposed Foreign-Trade Zone; Richmond, VA (Richmond-Petersburg Port of Entry); Application and Public Hearing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Capital Region Airport Commission,
requesting authority to establish a general-purpose foreign-trade zone in Richmond, within the Richmond-Petersburg
Customs port of entry. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as
amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on January 24,
1994. The applicant is authorized to make the proposal under Virginia Acts of Assembly 1980, Chapter 380, &sect;8.10.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed foreign-trade zone would involve the Richmond International Airport complex (2,055 acres), some 5
miles east of the City of Richmond. The complex is owned by the Airport Commission, which plans to contract with a qualified
firm for operation of the zone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application contains evidence of the need for zone services in the Richmond area. Several firms have indicated
an interest in using zone procedures for warehousing/distribution of such items as automobile parts, laboratory
equipment, musical instruments and pharmaceuticals. Specific manufacturing approvals are not being sought at
this time. Requests would be made to the Board on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790&hyph;50808, 10&hyph;8&hyph;91), a member of
the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the investigation, the Commerce examiner will hold a public hearing on March 16, 1994, at 9 a.m., in the Auditorium
of the Metropolitan Richmond Chamber of Commerce, 201 East Franklin Street, Richmond, Virginia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is April
4, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during
the subsequent 15-day period (to April 19, 1994).

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to timely requests for an administrative review by the respondents, Branco Peres Citrus (Branco Peres),
Citropectina, S.A., and Frutropic, S.A., the Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting an administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) from Brazil. The review covers three
manufacturers/exporters of this merchandise to the United States and the period May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992.
We preliminarily determine the dumping margins for Branco Peres, Citropectina, and Frutropic to be zero or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
during this period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department intends to revoke the antidumping duty order with respect to Frutropic because we have reason to believe
that Frutropic has sold the subject merchandise at not less than foreign market value for a period of at least three
consecutive years and is not likely to sell the subject merchandise at less than foreign market value in the future.
We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 5, 1987, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an antidumping duty order on frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) from Brazil (52 FR 16426). On May 31, 1992, pursuant
to the Department's notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (57 FR 19412) of the antidumping
duty order on FCOJ from Brazil for the period May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992, Branco Peres, Citropectina, and Frutropic
requested an administrative review for this period. Accordingly, the Department initiated this administrative
review on June 18, 1992 (57 FR 27212). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Frutropic submitted a timely request for revocation of the antidumping duty order, accompanied by the
certification required by &sect;353.25(b)(1) of the Department's regulations. The Department has now conducted
this review in accordance with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Scope of Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by the administrative review are shipments of frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) from Brazil.
The merchandise is currently classifiable under item 2009.11.00 of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harmonized Tariff Schedule 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(HTS). The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review covers three manufacturers/exporters of the subject merchandise to the United States for the period May
1, 1991 through April 31, 1992: Branco Peres, Citropectina, and Frutropic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
United States Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating the United States price, we used both purchase price and exporter's sales price (ESP) as defined in
section 772 of the Tariff Act. Purchase price was used for those sales to the United States which were made prior to importation,
while ESP was used for those sales which were made after importation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Purchase price was based on the packed f.o.b. price to unrelated purchasers in the United States. For purchase price
sales, where applicable, we made deductions for foreign inland freight, Brazilian port charges, export taxes, commissions,
packing, and credit expenses. ESP was based on the packed delivered price to the first unrelated purchaser in the United
States. For ESP sales, we made deductions for brokerage and handling expenses, foreign inland freight, ocean freight
and marine insurance, U.S. duty, U.S. Customs' fees and harbor maintenance fees, U.S. inland freight and insurance,
packing, commissions, discounts, rebates, credit expenses and indirect selling expenses. No other adjustments
were claimed or allowed.

Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating foreign market value (FMV), the Department based FMV on third country f.o.b. prices for all respondents,
in accordance with section 773 of the Act. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, marine
insurance, foreign and brokerage and handling, and export taxes. Where applicable, we deducted foreign packing
expenses and added U.S. packing to third country price (packing costs were not incurred on bulk sales). We adjusted
FMV, where applicable, for differences in credit expenses, and post-sale warehousing expenses. In the case of comparisons
to ESP sales, we made an adjustment for indirect selling expenses, limited by the amount of indirect selling expenses
incurred in the United States. No other adjustments were claimed or allowed.

In calculating FMV in the context of administrative reviews, it is the Department's practice to use a monthly weighted-average
of third country or home market sales, as appropriate, for comparison to the U.S. sales price when several home market
or third country sales may represent the behavior of the company for a given month during the period of review. (See
``Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice from Brazil; Preliminary Results and Termination in Part of Antidumping Duty
Administrative Review,'' February 3, 1992, 57 FR 3995.) However, in this review, distortions could result from the
application of a monthly FMV because of hyper-inflation. Where such distortions would have been created, we calculated
FMVs, as we have done in previous reviews, based on shorter periods as determined by the Brazilian government-mandated
minimum export price (which is derived from the FCOJ 30-day futures contract price on the New York Cotton Exchange).
(See ``Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice From Brazil; Preliminary Results and Termination In Part of Antidumping
Duty Administrative Review; Intent to Revoke in Part the Antidumping Duty Order,'' June 19, 1991, 56 FR 28138.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of Branco Peres, the Department used constructed value, as defined in section 773 of the Act, for comparison
to those U.S. sales where no contemporaneous third country sales existed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Constructed value consisted of the sum of the costs of materials, fabrication, general selling and administrative
expenses, freight and profit. Because the actual profit was more than the statutory minimum of eight percent of the
sum of general expenses and cost of manufacture, we added the actual profit in accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(ii)
of the Act.

The Department intends to revoke the antidumping duty order with respect to Frutropic if, at the time the Department
publishes the final results of this review, Frutropic has demonstrated three consecutive years of sales at not less
than foreign market value, and it is not likely that Frutropic will sell subject merchandise at less than foreign market
value in the future. As required by &sect;353.25(c)(2)(ii) of the Department's regulations, the Department has
conducted a verification of all factual information submitted by Frutropic in this administrative review.

The Department shall determine, and the U.S. Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise

administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company,
in the event the order is not revoked in part, will be that established in the final results of this administrative review;
(2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be
the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review,
a prior review, or the original less-than-fair-value investigation, but the manufacturer is such a firm, the cash
deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise.

Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation (or that rate
as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping
duty orders for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. In proceedings
governed by antidumping findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation,
the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final
results of administrative review published by the Department (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical
error or as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all
current and future administrative reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this
review will be 1.96 percent

This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 28, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 57986) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on industrial
phosphoric acid from Israel (52 FR 31057; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 19, 1987) covering the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. The Department has now completed this
administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by this review are shipments of Israeli industrial phosphoric acid. During the review period, such
merchandise was classifiable under item number 2809.20.00 of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harmonized Tariff Schedule 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(HTS). The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review covers the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991 and nine programs. Negev Phosphates, Ltd. (NPL),
which merged with Rotem Fertilizers Ltd. on December 31, 1991 after operating independently throughout the review
period, was the only known producer exporting the subject merchandise from Israel to the United States during the
1991 review period.

Analysis of Comments Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received a written comment from
the respondents, the Government of Israel (GOI) and NPL, and a written rebuttal comment from the petitioners, the
Monsanto Company and FMC Corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondents argue that the cash deposit rate should be reduced by the amount of benefit attributable to the Exchange
Rate Risk Insurance Scheme (EIS) because the program was terminated prior to the publication of these final results.
The GOI and NPL state that most EIS claims will be paid by the end of 1993 as indicated in the GOI response to the Department's
questionnaire. The GOI and NPL also point to the reduction in benefits that exporters received from this program in
this review period compared to those received in the prior administrative review. Thus, respondents claim that it
is unreasonable to base the deposit rate for future entries on benefits received in 1991, given the program's declining
benefits and termination with limited residual benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners point out that the exact timing of NPL's receipt of benefits under the EIS will depend on variables such
as the time necessary for shipment of the goods and EIS processing of the claim. According to petitioners, these uncertainties
preclude the determination of a fixed date for actual termination of benefits to be received by NPL. As a result, EIS
benefits should continue to be reflected in the cash deposit rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree with the respondents. The Department's regulations require the Department to instruct the Customs Service
to collect a cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties on future entries. The Department normally uses as an
estimate of countervailing duties on future entries the assessment rate found in the final results of review (see
19 CFR 355.22(c)(10)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the EIS program was terminated, it is clear that some payments may continue to be received beyond the date
of EIS termination by exporters who entered into EIS contracts before termination of the program. In situations in
which a government terminates a program but residual benefits may continue to be bestowed under the terminated program,
it is the Department's practice not to adjust the deposit rate.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(57 FR 1454; January 14, 1992). In order to adjust the cash deposit rate as a result of a program-wide change, the Secretary
must be able to measure the change in the level of countervailable subsidies provided under the program in question
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(54 FR 23366; May 31, 1989). Therefore, because residual benefits from the EIS program may continue to be provided
after the date of our preliminary results and cannot be measured, we have not adjusted the cash deposit rate as a result
of the termination of the EIS program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Results of Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing all of the comments received, we determine the net subsidy to be 6.98 percent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ad valorem 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for all companies during the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailing duties of 6.98 percent of the
f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of this merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1991 and on or before December
31, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to collect a cash deposit of 6.98 percent of the f.o.b. invoice
price on all shipments of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date
of publication of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This cash deposit shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This permit application is to incidentally harass marine mammals and sea turtles by a low frequency (60&hyph;80 Hz)
sound source which will be located due west of Pt. Sur, California, at 850&hyph;950m depth. This sound source is part
of the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) Program, and will be operated from approximately April 1, 1994,
through March 31, 1996, with a maximum duty cycle of 8%, to conduct research on the effects of this source on marine mammals.
The transmission bandwidth is approximately 20 Hz with a level of 195 dB (re: 1 uPa at 1m) and the spectrum level for the
peak frequency (70 Hz) is 182 dB (re: 1 uPa at 1m). The effects of these transmissions on marine mammals and sea turtles
will be monitored through passive acoustic tracking, satellite and recoverable tagging of ``indicator'' species,
and visual surveys and observations.

The instrument is an accessory to an existing mass spectrometer that is being used for stable-isotope ratio analysis
of tree ring, soil and carbonate samples. Measurements will be used to develop relationships with environmental
parameters (especially drought) which may be used to reconstruct paleo-environmental seasonal variation. The
system represents an improvement in allowing small samples to be easily analyzed and permitting analysis in an automated
mode. The instrument will also be used for educational purposes demonstrating the latest stable isotope ratio technology
and research applications to graduate students in geosciences, hydrology, watershed management and ecology.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Executive Order 11625, and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is
soliciting competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) program. The total
cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months) from June 1, 1994 to May 31, 1995 is estimated at $222,196.
The total Federal Amount is $188,867 and is composed of $184,260 plus the Audit Fee Amount of $4,607. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% ($33,329) of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations
thereof. The MBDC will operate in the State of Connecticut geographic service area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding instrument for the MBDC will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state, and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC Program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered
programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will
then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the
demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose
of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal
Awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will
not necessarily receive the award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist them in this effort, MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&amp;TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, MBDCs will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross sales
of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.

This notice announces that anyone entering the commercial fishery for live rock in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ)
off the coastal states of the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico after February 3, 1994 may not be assured of future access

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) that limits the number of participants in the fishery. This notice is intended to discourage new entries into the
fishery based on economic speculation while the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Councils (Councils)
consider fishery management options that range from limited access to a total prohibition of live rock harvest.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Councils are developing Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico
and the South Atlantic (FMP) that would add ``live rock'' to the fishery management unit. Live rock means certain living
marine organisms, or an assemblage thereof, attached to a hard substrate (including dead coral or rock). In addition
to live corals, these organisms may include anemones, sponges, tube worms, mollusks, crustaceans, bryozoans, sea
squirts, and marine algae. Management measures adopted could include harvest limitations, such as limited entry
or a total prohibition of harvest to prevent fishery habitat loss, a provision for aquaculture of live rock, and permits
for scientific and educational collections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1989, the Florida Department of Natural Resources (FDNR) (now Department of Environmental Protection) determined
that live rock harvest (i.e., the collection of rocks with marine organisms attached for use in home aquariums) was
detrimental to the Florida Reef Tract and other hard bottom habitat areas. The Florida Marine Fisheries Commission
(FMFC) noted that the only current net production of the carbonate substrate underlying live rock occurs on living
rock reefs and, in Florida, these areas are either in equilibrium or eroding. FDNR personnel testified that more than
90 percent of the live rock examined at the request of enforcement agents contained visible colonies of prohibited
corals, such as stony corals and sea fans. The FMFC concluded that live rock removal (1) can violate State and Federal
laws that prohibit taking of corals, (2) reduces the surface area and topographic complexity of Florida's coral reefs
and other live bottom areas, and (3) removes entire micro-communities along with targeted aquarium species. As a
result of this rulemaking, live rock harvesting efforts shifted to the EEZ off Florida.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FMFC has noted that in 1991 approximately 35 individuals reported combined landings of about 300 tons of live rock
from EEZ waters adjacent to the Florida Reef Tract, Florida's east coast reefs, and the Gulf of Mexico hard bottom areas.
In 1992, reported Florida landings from the EEZ totalled about 400 tons.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Councils have discussed the live rock issue, particularly pertaining to EEZ waters over recent years,
they took no regulatory action since the FMFC had decided to initiate rulemaking regarding live rock landings from
the EEZ off Florida. Specifically, the Councils deferred action since Florida's planned phase-out of live rock landings
appeared to address what seemed to be a Florida area management issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1992 the Florida Governor and Cabinet approved the FMFC rule to phase-out live rock landings from the EEZ over
a 3-year period ending on June 30, 1995. The phase-out period was designed to allow development of live rock aquaculture
which would be exempt from the harvest ban. The phase-out was to be accomplished by a 25 percent annual reduction in
allowable landings (based on the 1991 reported landings) accompanied by a 500 pound daily vessel limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 31, 1993, a U.S. District Court Judge issued a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of Florida's
quota and vessel landing limits relating to possession or landing of live rock taken in the EEZ. Florida live rock fishermen
argued that the Magnuson Act superseded state landing laws and the Councils had made ``an affirmative and conscious
decision'' not to prohibit the taking of live rock in the EEZ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the District Court action, the Councils are now concerned that removal of live rock from the EEZ is currently
unregulated. Also, there is growing interest in harvest of live rock from North Carolina to Alabama. In April 1993,
the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) approved a motion to include live rock in the FMP and reactivate
the Coral Advisory Panel. In May 1993, the Gulf Council, on being advised of live rock landings in Alabama, and at the
request of that State and Florida, initiated development of options for live rock management. In June 1993, the SAFMC
held a public scoping meeting in Duck Key, Florida, to solicit input from the harvesters and the general public on the
management of live rock. In November 1993, the Councils prepared draft Amendment 2 to the FMP to address the live rock
issue, and established a schedule for future public hearings. See

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 to obtain a copy of this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing a control date and making this announcement, the Councils intend to discourage speculative entry
into the live rock fishery while they discuss possible management regimes. As the Councils consider a limited entry
or access-controlled management regime, among other options, certain fishermen who do not currently harvest live
rock, and never have done so, may decide to enter the fishery for the sole purpose of establishing a record of making
commercial live rock landings. In the absence of a control date, such a record generally may be considered indicative
of economic dependence on the fishery. In addition, when management authorities begin to consider use of a limited
access management regime, speculative entry into a fishery often is responsible for a rapid increase in fishing effort
that may exacerbate adverse environmental impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishment of a control date does not commit the Councils or the Secretary of Commerce to any particular management
regime or criterion for entry into the commercial fishery for live rock. Fishermen are not guaranteed future participation
in the fishery regardless of their date of entry or intensity of participation in the fishery before or after the control
date. The Councils may subsequently choose a different control date, or they may choose a management regime that does
not make use of such a date.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Jacksonville District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact
Statement for the Palm Beach County Shore Protection Project. The SEIS concerns the Ocean Ridge Segment of the project.
The authorized project provides for the restoration and periodic nourishment of a section of beach starting at the
south jetty of South Lake Worth Inlet and extending south 1.6 miles. The nourishment of the Ocean Ridge segment will
provide protection to beachfront properties from wave damage and beach erosion.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Beach Erosion Control Project for Palm Beach County, Florida, was authorized on 23 October 1962, by Public Law
87&hyph;874. A General Design Memorandum (GDM) and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for Palm Beach County
was published in April 1987. The FEIS addressed the alternative methods of accomplishing the project goals and the
impacts associated with those alternatives. The project sponsor is the County of Palm Beach. A Supplemental Design
Memorandum and SEIS are currently being prepared for the Ocean Ridge segment to discuss the specific location of the
borrow area and because several alternative design modifications to the authorized project are being considered.
Environmental considerations will include the potential presence of historic and archeological resources, aesthetics,
endangered or threatened species, and adjacent marine habitats.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Scoping: The scoping process will involve Federal, State, county and municipal agencies, and other interested
persons and organizations. A scoping letter (December 7, 1993) has been sent to interested Federal, State, county
and municipal agencies requesting their comments and concerns. Any persons and organizations wishing to participate
in the scoping process should contact the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the address given in this notice. Significant
issues that are anticipated include concern for offshore hard bottom communities, fisheries, water quality, sea
turtles and sea turtle nests. Consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) during the development
of the FEIS indicated that historical and archaeological resources may be present in the project area. Further coordination
with the SHPO will occur during the preparation of the SEIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Coordination with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service will be accomplished
in compliance with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Coordination required by applicable Federal and State
laws and policies will be conducted. Since the project will require the discharge of material into waters of the United
States, the discharge will comply with the provisions of section 404 of the Clean Water Act as amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. SEIS Preparation: It is estimated that a draft SEIS will be available to the public in June 1994.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this notice is to provide current Regulatory Guidance Letters (RGL's) to all interested parties. RGL's
are used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Headquarters as a means to transmit guidance on the permit program (33 CFR
320&hyph;330) to its division and district engineers (DE's). Each future RGL will be published in the Notice section
of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a means to insure the widest dissemination of this information while reducing costs to the Federal Government.
The Corps no longer maintains a mailing list to furnish copies of the RGL's to the public.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
RGL's were developed by the Corps as a system to organize and track written guidance issued to its field agencies. RGL's
are normally issued as a result of evolving policy; judicial decisions and changes to the Corps regulations or another
agency's regulations which affect the permit program. RGL's are used only to interpret or clarify existing regulatory
program policy, but do provide mandatory guidance to Corps district offices. RGL's are sequentially numbered and
expire on a specified date. After a RGL's expiration date has passed, it no longer constitutes mandatory guidance
for Corps district and division offices. Nevertheless, many expired RGL's still provide useful, non-mandatory
guidance which Corps field offices have the discretion to follow. On the other hand, some RGL's have been superseded
by specific provisions of subsequently issued regulations or RGL's. In addition, other expired RGL's, in whole or
in part, may not be consistent with current Corps policy. The Corps incorporates most of the guidance provided by RGL's
whenever it revises its permit regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The purpose of this guidance is to provide clarification for district and division offices relating to extensions
of time for Department of Army permits (See 33 CFR 325.6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A permittee is informed of the time limit for completing an authorized activity by General Condition 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 of the standard permit form (ENG Form 1721). This condition states that a request for an extension of time should be
submitted to the authorizing official at least one month prior to the expiration date. This request should be in writing
and should explain the basis of the request. The DE may consider an oral request from the permittee provided it is followed
up with a written request prior to the expiration date. A request for an extension of time will usually be granted unless
the DE determines that the time extension would be contrary to the public interest. The one month submittal requirement
is a workload management time limit designed to prevent permittees from filing last minute time extension requests.
Obviously, the one month period is not sufficient to make a final decision on all time extension requests that are processed
in accordance with 33 CFR 325.2. It should be noted that a permittee may choose to request a time extension sooner than
this (e.g., six months prior to the expiration date). While there is no formal time limit of this nature, a request for
an extension of time should generally not be considered by the DE more than one year prior to the expiration date. A permit
will automatically expire if an extension is not requested and granted prior to the applicable expiration date (See
33 CFR 325.6(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requests for Time Extensions Prior to Expiration: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For requests of time extensions received prior to the expiration date, the DE should consider the following procedures
if a decision on the request cannot be completed prior to the permit expiration date: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The DE may grant an interim time extension while a final decision is being made; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The DE may, when appropriate, suspend the permit at the same time that an interim time extension is granted, while
a final decision is being made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requests for Time Extensions After Expiration: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At time extension cannot be granted if a time extension request is received after the applicable time limit. In such
cases, a new permit application must be processed, if the permittee wishes to pursue the work. However, the DE may consider
expedited processing procedures when: (1) The request is received shortly (generally 30 days) after the expiration
date, (2) the DE determines that there have been no substantial changes in the attendant circumstances since the original
authorization was issued, and (3) the De believes that the time extension would likely have been granted. Expedited
processing procedures may include, but are not limited to, not requiring that a new application form be submitted
or issuing a 15 day public notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this guidance is to clarify the Army Corps of Engineers leadership and decision-making role as ``project
manager'' for the evaluation of permit applications pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and section
10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. This guidance is also intended to encourage effective and efficient coordination
among prospective permittees, the Corps, and the Federal resource agencies (i.e., Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)). Implementation of this guidance
will help to streamline the permit process by minimizing delays and ensuring more timely decisions, while providing
a meaningful opportunity for substantive input from all Federal agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Department of the Army Regulatory Program must operate in an efficient manner in order to protect the aquatic
environment and provide fair, equitable, and timely decisions to the regulated public. Clear leadership and a predictable
decision-making framework will enhance the public acceptance of the program and allow the program to meet the important
objective of effectively protecting the Nation's valuable aquatic resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) On August 9, 1991, the President announced a comprehensive plan for improving the protection of the Nation's wetlands.
The plan seeks to balance two important objectives_the protection, restoration, and creation of wetlands and the
need for sustained economic growth and development. The plan, which is designed to slow and eventually stop the net
loss of wetlands, includes measures that will improve and streamline the current wetlands regulatory system. This
Regulatory Guidance Letter is issued in accordance with the President's plan for protecting wetlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The intent of this guidance is to express clearly that the Corps is the decision-maker and project manager for the
Department of Army's Regulatory Program. The Corps will consider, to the maximum extent possible, all timely, project-related
comments from other Federal agencies when making regulatory decisions. Furthermore, the Corps and relevant Federal
agencies will maintain and improve as necessary their working relationships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Federal resource agencies have reviewed and concurred with this guidance and have agreed to act in accordance
with these provisions. While this guidance does not restrict or impair the exercise of legal authorities vested in
the Federal resource agencies or States under the CWA or other statutes and regulations (e.g., EPA's authority under
section 404(c), section 404(f), and CWA geographic jurisdiction and FWS/NMFS authorities under the Fish and Wildlife
Coordination Act and the Endangered Species Act (ESA)), agency comments on Department of the Army permit applications
must be consistent with the provisions contained in this regulatory guidance letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Corps Project Management/Decision Making Role:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Corps is solely responsible for making final permit decisions pursuant to section 10 and section 404(a), including
final determinations of compliance with the Corps permit regulations, the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, and section
7(a)(2) of the ESA. As such, the Corps will act as the project manager for the evaluation of all permit applications.
The Corps will advise potential applicants of its role as the project manager and decision-maker. This guidance does
not restrict EPA's authority to make determinations of compliance with the Guidelines in carrying out its responsibilities
under sections 309 and 404(c) of the Clean Water Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) As the project manager, the Corps is responsible for requesting and evaluating information concerning all permit
applications. The Corps will obtain and utilize this information in a manner that moves, as rapidly as practical,
the regulatory process towards a final permit decision. The Corps will not evaluate applications as a project opponent
or advocate_but instead will maintain an objective evaluation, fully considering all relevant factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Corps will fully consider other Federal agencies' project-related comments when determining compliance
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, the ESA, the National Historic
Preservation Act, and other relevant statutes, regulations, and policies. The Corps will also fully consider the
agencies' views when determining whether to issue the permit, to issue the permit with conditions and/or mitigation,
or to deny the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Federal Resource Agencies' Role:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) It is recognized that the Federal resource agencies have an important role in the Department of the Army Regulatory
Program under the CWA, NEPA, ESA, Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act, and other relevant statutes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When providing comments, Federal resource agencies will submit to the Corps only substantive, project-related
information on the impacts of activities being evaluated by the Corps and appropriate and practicable measures to
mitigate adverse impacts. The comments will be submitted within the time frames established in interagency agreements
and regulations. Federal resource agencies will limit their comments to their respective areas of expertise and
authority to avoid duplication with the Corps and other agencies and to provide the Corps with a sound basis for making
permit decisions. The Federal resource agencies should not submit comments that attempt to interpret the Corps regulations
or for the purposes of section 404(a) make determinations concerning compliance with the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines.
Pursuant to its authority under section 404(b)(1) of the CWA, the EPA may provide comments to the Corps identifying
its views regarding compliance with the Guidelines. While the Corps will fully consider and utilize agency comments,
the final decision regarding the permit application, including a determination of compliance with the Guidelines,
rests solely with the Corps.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pre-application Consultation:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) To provide potential applicants with the maximum degree of relevant information at an early phase of project planning,
the Corps will increase its efforts to encourage pre-application consultations in accordance with regulations
at 33 CFR 325.1(b). Furthermore, while encouraging pre-application consultation, the Corps will emphasize the
need for early consultation concerning mitigation requirements, if impacts to aquatic resources may occur. The
Corps is responsible for initiating, coordinating, and conducting pre-application consultations and other discussions
and meetings with applicants regarding Department of the Army permits. This may not apply in instances where the consultation
is associated with the review of a separate permit or license required from another Federal agency (e.g., the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission) or in situations where resource agencies perform
work for others outside the context of a specific Department of the Army permit application (e.g., the conservation
Reserve Program and technical assistance to applicants of Federal grants).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For those pre-application consultations involving activities that may result in impacts to aquatic resources,
the Corps will provide EPA, FWS, NMFS (as appropriate), and other appropriate Federal and State agencies, a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the pre-application process. The invited agencies will participate to the maximum
extent possible in the pre-application consultation, since this is generally the best time to consider alternatives
for avoiding or reducing adverse impacts. To the extent practical, the Corps and the Federal resource agencies will
develop local procedures (e.g., teleconferencing) to promote reasonable and effective pre-application consultations
within the logistical constraints of all affected parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applications for Individual Permits:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Corps is responsible for determining the need for, and the coordination of, interagency meetings, requests
for information, and other interactions between permit applicants and the Federal Government. In this regard, Federal
resource agencies will contact the Corps to discuss and coordinate any additional need for information for the applicant.
The Corps will cooperate with the Federal resource agencies to ensure, to the extent practical, that information
necessary for the agencies to carry out their responsibilities is obtained. If it is determined by the Corps that an
applicant meeting is necessary for the exchange of information with a Federal resource agency and the Corps chooses
not to participate in such a meeting, the Federal resource agency will apprise the Corps, generally in writing, of
that agency's discussions with the applicant. Notwithstanding such meetings, the Corps is solely responsible for
permit requirements, including mitigation and other conditions_the Federal resource agencies must not represent
their views as regulatory requirements. In circumstances where the Corps meets with the applicant and develops information
that will affect the permit decision, the Corps will apprise the Federal resource agencies of such information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Consistent with 33 CFR part 325, the Corps will ensure that public notices contain sufficient information to facilitate
the timely submittal of project-specific comments from the Federal resource agencies. The resource agencies comments
will provide specific information and/or data related to the proposed project site. The Corps will fully consider
comments regarding the site from a watershed or landscape scale, including an evaluation of potential cumulative
and secondary impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Corps must consider cumulative impacts in reaching permit decisions. In addition to the Corps own expertise
and experience, the Corps will fully consider comments from the Federal resource agencies, which can provide valuable
information on cumulative impacts. Interested Federal agencies are encouraged to provide periodically to the Corps

(a) The Corps is responsible for proposing potential general permits, assessing impacts of and comments on proposed
general permits, and deciding whether to issue general permits. The Corps will consider proposals for general permits
from other sources, including the Federal resource agencies, although the final decision regarding the need to propose
a general permit rests with the Corps. Other interested Federal agencies should provide comments to the Corps on proposed
general permits. These Federal agency comments will be submitted consistent with established agreements and regulations
and will focus on the Federal agencies' area(s) of expertise. The Corps will fully consider such agencies' comments
in deciding whether to issue general permits, including programmatic general permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Corps is responsible for initiating and conducting meetings that may be necessary in developing and evaluating
potential general permits. Any discussions with a State or local Government regarding proposed programmatic general
permits will be coordinated through and conducted by the Corps. Prior to issuing a programmatic general permit, the
Corps will ensure that the State or local program, by itself or with appropriate conditions, will protect the aquatic
environment, including wetlands, to the level required by the section 404 program.

 Water Dependency and Cranberry Production

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the applicability of the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines water dependency
provisions (40 CFR 230.10(a)) to the cultivation of cranberries, in light of Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulations
at 33 CFR 323.4(a)(1)(iii)(C)(1) (ii) and (iii), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations at 40 CFR
232.3(d)(3)(i) (B) and (C). These sections of the Corps and EPA regulations state, among other things, that cranberries
are a wetland crop, and that some discharges associated with cranberry production are considered exempt from regulation
under the provisions of section 404(f) of the Clean Water Act. The characterization of cranberries as a wetland crop
has led to inconsistency in determining if cranberry production is a water dependent activity as defined in the section
404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The intent of Corps regulations at 33 CFR 320.4(b) and of the Guidelines is to avoid the unnecessary destruction
or alteration of waters of the U.S., including wetlands, and to compensate for the unavoidable loss of such waters.
The Guidelines specifically required that ``no discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there
is a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem,
so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences'' (see 40 CFR 230.10(a)).
Based on this provision, an evaluation is required in every case for use of non-aquatic areas and other aquatic sites
that would result in less adverse impact to the aquatic ecosystem, irrespective of whther the discharge site is a special
aquatic site or whether the activity associated with the discharge is water dependent. A permit cannot be issued,
therefore, in circumstances where an environmentally preferable practicable alternative for the proposed discharge
exists (except as provided for under section 404(b)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. For proposed discharges into wetlands and other ``special acquatic sites,'' the Guidelines alternatives analysis
requirement further considers whether the activity associated with the proposed discharge is ``water dependent''.
The Guidelines define water dependency in terms of an activity requiring access or proximity to or siting within a
special aquatic site to fulfill its basic project purpose. Special aquatic sites (as defined in 40 CFR 230.40&hyph;230.45)
are: (1) Sanctuaries and refuges; (2) wetlands; (3) mud flats; (4) vegetated shallows; (5) coral reefs; and (6) riffle
and pool complexes. If an activity is determined not to be water dependent, the Guidelines establish the follow two
presumptions (40 CFR 230.10(a)(3)) that the applicant is required to rebut before satisfying the alternatives analysis
requirements:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. That practicable alternatives that do not involve special aquatic sites are presumed to be available; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. That all practicable alternatives to the proposed discharge which do not involve a discharge into a special aquatic
site are presumed to have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the responsibility of the applicant to clearly rebut these presumptions in order to demonstrate compliance
with the Guidelines alternatives test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If an activity is determined to be water dependent, the rebuttable presumptions stated in paragraph 3 of this memorandum
do not apply. However, the proposed discharge, whether or not it is associated with a water dependent activity, must
represent the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative in order to comply with the alternatives
analysis requirement of the Guidelines as described in paragraph 2 of this memorandum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. As previously indicated, Corps and EPA regulations consider cranberries as a wetland crop species. This characterization
of cranberries as a wetland crop species is based primarily on the listing of cranberries as an obligate hydrophyte
in the National List of Plant Species That Occur in Wetlands (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Report 88 (26.1&hyph;26.13))
and the fact that cranberries must be grown in wetlands or areas altered to create a wetland environment. Therefore,
the Corps and EPA consider the construction of cranberry beds, including associated dikes and water control structures
associated with dikes (i.e., headgates, weirs, drop inlet structures), to be a water dependent activity. Consequently,
discharges directly associated with cranberry bed construction are not subject to the presumptions applicable
to non-water dependent activities discussed in paragraph 3 of this memorandum. However, consistent with the requirements
of &sect;230.10(a), the proposed discharge must represent the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative,
after considering aquatic and non-aquatic alternatives as appropriate. To be considered practicable, an alternative
must be available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics
in light of overall project purposes. For commercial cranberry cultivation, practicable alternatives may include
upland sites with proper characteristics for creating the necessary conditions to grow cranberries. Factors that
must be considered in making a determination of whether or not upland alternatives are practicable include soil pH,
topography, soil permeability, depth to bedrock, depth to seasonal high water table, adjacent land uses, water supply,
and, for expansion of existing cranberry operations, proximity to existing cranberry farms. EPA Regions and Corps
Districts are encouraged to work together with local cranberry growers to refine these factors to reflect their regional
conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In contrast, the following activities often associated with the cultivation and harvesting of cranberries are
not considered water dependent: construction of roads, ditches, reservoirs, and pump houses that are used during
the cultivation of cranberries, and construction of secondary support facilities for shipping, storage, packaging,
parking, etc. Therefore, the rebuttable practicable alternatives presumptions discussed in paragraph 3 of this
memorandum apply to the discharges associated with these non-water dependent activities. However, since determinations
of practicability under the Guidelines includes consideration of cost, technical, and logistics factors, determining
the availability of practicable alternatives to discharges associated with these non-water dependent activities
must involve consideration of the need of an alternative to be proximate to the cranberry bed in order to achieve the
basic project purpose of cranberry cultivation. Once it has been determined that the location of the cranberry bed,
including associated dikes, and water control structures, represents the least environmentally damaging practicable
alternative, practicable alternatives for maintenance roads, ditches, reservoirs and pump houses will generally
be limited to the bed itself and the area in the vicinity of the actual bed. For example, the bed dikes may be the only practicable
alternative for location of maintenance roads. When practicable alternatives cannot be identified within such
geographic constraints, the applicant must minimize the impacts of the roads, reservoirs, etc., to the maximum extent
practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. During review of applications for discharges associated with cranberry cultivation, it is important to reiterate
that proposed discharges must also comply with the other requirements of the Guidelines (i.e., 40 CFR 230.10 (b) (c)
and (d)). In addition, evaluations of all discharges, whether or not the proposed discharge is associated with a water
dependent activity, must comply with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, including an investigation
of alternatives to the proposed discharge. Further, applications for discharges associated with cranberry cultivation
will continue to be evaluated in accordance with current Corps and EPA policy and practice concerning mitigation,
cumulative impact analysis, and public interest review factors.

1. The 1980 Amendments to the Coastal Zone Management Act define the SAMP process as ``a comprehensive plan providing
for natural resource protection and reasonable coastal-dependent economic growth containing a detailed and comprehensive
statement of policies, standards and criteria to guide public and private uses of lands and waters; and mechanisms
for timely implementation in specific geographic areas within the coastal zone.'' This process of collaborative
interagency planning within a geographic area of special sensitivity is just as applicable in non-coastal areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A good SAMP reduces the problems associated with the traditional case-by-case review. Developmental interests
can plan with predictability and environmental interests are assured that individual and cumulative impacts are
analyzed in the context of broad ecosystem needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Because SAMP's are very labor intensive, the following ingredients should usually exist before a district engineer
becomes involved in a SAMP:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The area should be environmentally sensitive and under strong developmental pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. There should be a sponsoring local agency to ensure that the plan fully reflects local needs and interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Ideally there should be full public involvement in the planning and development process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. All parties must express a willingness at the outset to conclude the SAMP process with a definitive regulatory product
(see next paragraph).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. An ideal SAMP would conclude with two products: (1) Appropriate local/State approvals and a Corps general permit
(GP) or abbreviated processing procedure (APP) for activities in specifically defined situations; and (2) a local/State
restriction and/or an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 404(c) restriction (preferably both) for undesirable
activities. An individual permit review may be conducted for activities that do not fall into either category above.
However, it should represent a small number of the total cases addressed by the SAMP. We recognize that an ideal SAMP
is difficult to achieve, and, therefore, it is intended to represent an upper limit rather than an absolute requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. EPA's program for advance identification of disposal areas found at 40 CFR 230.80 can be integrated into a SAMP process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In accordance with this guidance, district engineers are encouraged to participate in development of SAMP's.
However, since development of a SAMP can require a considerable investment of time, resources, and money, the SAMP
process should be entered only if it is likely to result in a definitive regulatory product as defined in paragraph
4. above.

 Section 401 Water Quality Certification and Coastal Zone Management Act Conditions for Nationwide Permits
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The purpose of this Regulatory Guidance Letter (RGL) is to provide additional guidance and clarification for divisions
and districts involved in developing acceptable conditions under the section 401 Water Quality Certifications
and Coastal Zone Management Act (CZM) concurrences for the Nationwide Permit (NWP) Program. This RGL represents
a clarification if 330.4(c) (2) and (3) and 330.4(d) (2) and (3), concerning when NWP Section 401 and CZM conditions
should not be accepted and thus treated as a denial without prejudice. The principles contained in this RGL also apply
to 401 certification and CZM concurrence conditions associated with individual permits and regional general permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Corps divisions and districts should work closely and cooperatively with the States to develop reasonable 401
and CZM conditions. All involved parties should participate in achieving the purpose of the NWP program, which is
to provide the public with an expeditious permitting process while, at the same time, safeguarding the environment
by only authorizing activities which result in no more than minimal individual and cumulative adverse effects. When
a State certifying agency or CZM agency proposes conditions, the division engineer is responsible for determining
whether 401 Water Quality Certification or CZM concurrence conditions are acceptable and comply with the provisions
of 33 CFR 325.4. In most cases it is expected that the conditions will be acceptable and the division engineer shall
recognize these conditions as regional conditions of the NWP's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unacceptable Conditions:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There will be cases when certain conditions will clearly be unacceptable and those conditioned 401 certifications
or CZM concurrences shall be considered administratively denied. Consequently, authorization for an activity
which meets the terms and conditions of such NWP(s) is denied without prejudice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Illegal conditions are clearly unacceptable. Illegal conditions would result in violation of a law or regulation,
or would require an illegal action. For example, a condition which would require an applicant to obtain a 401 certification
or CZM concurrence, where the State as previously denied certification or concurrence, prior to submitting a predischarge
notification (PDN) to the Corps in accordance with PDN procedures, would violate the Corps regulation at 33 CFR 330.4(c)(6).
Another example would be a case where an applicant would be required, through a condition, to apply for an individual
Department of the Army permit. Another example is a requirement by the State agency to utilize the 1989 Federal Wetland
Delineation Manual to establish jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. As a general rule, a condition that would require the Corps or another Federal agency to take an action which we would
not otherwise take and do not choose to take, would be clearly unacceptable. For example, where the certification
or concurrence is conditioned to require a PDN, where the proposed activity did not previously require a PDN, the Corps
should not accept that condition, since implicitly the Corps would have to accept and utilize the PDN. Another example
would be a situation where the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required, through a condition, to provide any type
of formal review or approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Section 401 or CZM conditions which provide for limits (quantities, dimensions, etc.) different from those imposed
by the NWP do not change the NWP limits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Higher limits are clearly not acceptable. For example, increasing NWP 18 for minor discharges from 10 to 50 cubic
yards would not be acceptable. Such conditions would confuse the regulated public and could contribute to violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Lower limits are acceptable but have the effect of denial without prejudice of those activities that are higher
than the Section 401 or CZM condition limit but within the NWP limit. Thus, if an applicant obtains an individual 401
water quality certification and/or CZM concurrence for work within the limits of an NWP where the State had denied
certification and/or CZM concurrence, then the activity could be authorized by the NWP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. A condition which would delete, modify, or reduce NWP conditions would be clearly unacceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Discretionary Enforcement: The initiation of enforcement actions by the Corps, whether directed at unauthorized
activities or to ensure compliance with permit conditions, is discretionary. The district engineer will consider
the following situations when determining whether to enforce 401 and/or CZM conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Unenforceable Conditions_Some conditions that a State may propose will not be reasonably enforceable by the Corps
(e.g., a condition requiring compliance with the specific terms of another State permit). Provided such conditions
do not violate paragraph 3 above, the conditions will be accepted by the Corps as regional conditions. However, limited
Corps resources should not be utilized in an attempt to enforce compliance with 401 or CZM conditions which the district
engineer believes to be essentially unenforceable, or of low enforcement priority for limited Corps resources.

b. Enforceable Conditions_Some other conditions proposed by a State may be considered enforceable, (e.g., a condition
requiring the applicant to obtain another State permit), but of low priority for Federal enforcement, since the Federal
Government would not have required those conditions but for the State's requirement. Furthermore, the Corps will
generally not enforce such State-imposed conditions except in very unusual cases, due to our limited personnel and
financial resources.

In response to NWP verification requests and PDN's, district engineers should utilize the sample paragraphs presented
below. This language should be used where conditional 401 certification or CZM concurrence has been issued. This
specifically addresses situations when the conditions included with the certification or concurrence are such
that the district engineer determines they are unforceable or the district engineer cannot clearly determine compliance
with the 401/CZM conditions (see 4.a.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Based on our review of your proposal to [describe proposal], we have determined that the activity qualifies for
the nationwide permit authorizations [insert NWP No(s.)], subject to the terms and conditions of the permit.

1. The 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA) amendments require most electric generating plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide
in phases beginning in 1995 and requiring full compliance by 2010. The congressional endorsement of the industry's
ability to select the most effective compliance method (e.g., sulfur dioxide scrubbers, low sulfur coal, or other
methods) recognizes the expertise of the industry in these cases and is a fundamental element in the CAA market-based
pollution control program. Given the need for cooling water, a substantial number of electric power generating plants
are located adjacent, or in close proximity, to waters of the United States, including wetlands. Depending on the
method chosen by the plants to reduce emissions, we expect that these facilities will be applying for Clean Water Act
section 404 permits for certain proposed activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The analysis and regulation under section 404 of the Clean Water Act of activities in waters of the United States
conducted by specific power plants to comply with the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments must ensure protection of the aquatic
environment consistent with the requirements of the Clean Water Act. The review of applications for such projects
will fully consider, consistent with requirements under the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, all practicable alternatives
including non-aquatic alternatives, for proposed discharges associated with the method selected by the utility
to comply with the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. For the purposes of the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines analysis, the
project purpose will be that pollutant reduction method selected by the permit applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. For example, a utility may have decided to install sulfur dioxide scrubbers on an existing power plant in order to
meet the new 1990 Clean Air Act standards. The proposed construction of the scrubbers, treatment ponds and a barge
unloading facility could impact wetlands. In this case, the section 404 review would evaluate practicable alternative
locations and configurations for the scrubbers, ponds and of the docking facilities. The analysis will also consider
practicable alternatives which satisfy the project purpose (i.e., installing scrubbers) but which have a less adverse
impact on the aquatic environment or do not involve discharges into waters of the United States. However, in order
to best effectuate Congressional intent reflected in the CAA that electric utilities retain flexibility to reduce
sulfur dioxide emissions in the most cost effective manner, the section 404 review should not evaluate alternative
methods of complying with the Clean Air Act standards not selected by the applicant (e.g., in this example use of low
sulfur coal).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In evaluating the scope of practicable alternatives which satisfy the project purpose (e.g., constructing additional
scrubber capacity), the alternatives analysis should not be influenced by the possibility that, based on a conclusion
that practicable upland alternatives are available to the applicant, the project proponent may decide to pursue
other options for meeting Clean Air Act requirements. Continuing the above example, a Corps determination that practicable
upland alternatives are available for scrubber waste disposal should not be affected by the possibility that an applicant
may subsequently decide to select a different method for meeting the Clean Air Act standards (e.g., use of low sulfur
coal that reduces waste generated by scrubbers).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Corps and EPA will also recognize the tight time-frames under which the industry must meet these new air quality
standards.

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this guidance is to establish a process that clarifies for applicants when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
has completed its evaluation and at what point the applicant should contact the State concerning the status of the
Section 401 Water Quality Certification and/or Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence. This process
also allows for more accurate measurement of the total length of time spent by the Corps in evaluating permit applications
(i.e., from receipt of a complete application until the Corps reaches a permit decision). For verification of authorization
of activities under regional general permits, the Corps will use the appropriate nationwide permit procedures at
33 CFR 330.6.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a. A Department of the Army permit involving a discharge of dredged or fill material cannot be issued until a State Section
401 Water Quality Certification has been issued or waived. Also, a Department of the Army permit cannot be issued for
a activity within a State with a federally-approved Coastal Management Program when that activity that would occur
within, or outside, a State's coastal zone will affect land or water uses or natural resources of the State's coastal
zone, until the State concurs with the applicant's consistency determination, or concurrence is presumed. In many
cases, the Corps completes its review before the State Section 401 Water Quality Certification or CZM concurrence
requirements have been satisfied. In such cases, applicants and the public are often confused regarding who to deal
with regarding resolution of any State issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The ``provisional permit'' procedures described below will facilitate a formal communication between the Corps
and the applicant to clearly indicate that the applicant should be in contact with the appropriate State agencies
to satisfy the State 401 Water Quality Certification or CZM concurrence requirements. In addition, the procedures
will allow for a more accurate measurement of the Corps permit evaluation time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provisional Permit Procedures:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisional permit procedures are optional and may only be used in those cases where: (i) The District Engineer
(DE) has made a provisional individual permit decision that an individual permit should be issued, and (ii) the only
action(s) preventing the issuance of that permit is that the State has not issued a required Section 401 Water Quality
Certification (or waiver has not occurred) or the State has not concurred in the applicant's CZM consistency determination
(or there is not a presumed concurrence). In such cases, the DE may, using these optional procedures, send a provisional
permit to the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. First, the DE will prepare and sign the provisional permit decision document. Then the provisional permit will
be sent to the applicant by transmittal letter. (The sample transmittal letter at enclosure 1 contains the minimum
information that must be provided.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Next, the applicant would obtain the Section 401 Water Quality Certification (or waiver) and/or CZM consistency
concurrence (or presumed concurrence). Then the applicant would sign the provisional permit and return it to the
DE along with the appropriate fee and the Section 401 Water Quality Certification (or proof of wavier) and/or the CZM
consistency concurrence (or proof of presumed concurrence).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Finally, the Corps would attach any Section 401 Water Quality Certification and/or CZM consistency concurrence
to the provisional permit, then sign the provisional permit (which then becomes the issued final permit), and forward
the permit to the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. This is the same basic process as the normal standard permit transmittal process except that the applicant is sent
an unsigned permit (i.e., a provisional permit) prior to obtaining the Section 401 Water Quality Certification (or
waiver) and/or CZM consistency concurrence (or presumed concurrence). (See enclosure 2.) A permit cannot be issued
(i.e., signed by the Corps) until the Section 401 and CZM requirements are satisfied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provisional Permit:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A provisional permit is a standard permit document with a cover sheet. The cover sheet must clearly indicate the following:
that a provisional permit is enclosed, that the applicant must obtain the section 401 Water Quality Certification
or CZM concurrence from the State, that these documents must be sent to the Corps along with the provisional permit
signed by the applicant, and that the Corps will issue the permit upon receipt of these materials. The issued permit
is the provisional permit signed by the applicant and the Corps. The provisional permit must contain a statement indicating
that the applicant is required to comply with the Section 401 Water Quality Certification, including any conditions,
and/or the CZM consistency concurrence, including any conditions. At enclosure 3 is a sample cover sheet for the provisional
permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provisional Permit Decision:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The DE may reach a final decision that a permit should be issued provided that the State issues a Section 401 Water Quality
Certification and/or a CZM concurrence. In order to reach such a decision the DE must complete the normal standard
permit evaluation process, prepare and sign a decision document, and prepare a standard permit, including any conditions
or mitigation (i.e., a provisional permit). The decision document must include a statement that the DE has determined
that the permit will be issued if the State issues a Section 401 Water Quality Certification or waiver and/or a CZM concurrence,
or presumed concurrence. The standard permit will not contain a condition that requires or provides for the applicant
to obtain a Section 401 Water Quality Certification and/or CZM concurrence. Once the decision document is signed,
the applicant has the right to a DA permit if the State issues a Section 401 Water Quality Certification or waiver and/or
a CZM concurrence, or if concurrence is presumed. Once the decision document is signed, the permittee's right to proceed
can only be changed by using the modification, suspension and revocation procedures of 33 CFR 325.7, unless the State
denies the Section 401 Water Quality Certification or nonconcurs with the applicant's CZM consistency determination.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Enforcement: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some cases, applicants might proceed with the project upon receipt of the provisional permit. The provisional
permit is not a valid permit. In such cases, the Corps has a discretionary enforcement action to consider and should
proceed as the DE determines to be appropriate. This occurs on occasion during the standard permit transmittal process.
Since the Corps is not changing the normal process of sending unsigned permits to the applicant for signature, there
should not be an increase in occurrence of such unauthorized activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Modification: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. In most cases the Section 401 Water Quality Certification, including conditions, and/or CZM consistency concurrence,
including conditions, will be consistent with the provisional permit. In such cases, the DE will simply sign the final
permit enclose the 401 water quality certification and/or CZM consistency concurrence with the final permit (i.e.,
the signed provisional permit). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. In a few cases such State approval may necessitate modifications to the Corps preliminary permit decision. Such
modifications will be processed in accordance with 33 CFR 325.7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When the modifications are minor and the DE agrees to such modifications, then a supplement to the provisional
decision document may be prepared, as appropriate, and the permit issued with such modifications. (This should usually
be done by enclosing the State 401 Water Quality Certification and/or CZM consistency concurrence to the permit,
but in a few cases may require a revision to the permit document itself.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the modification results in substantial change or measurable increase in adverse impacts or the Corps does
not initially agree with the change, then the modification will be processed and counted as a separate permit action
for reporting purposes. This may require a new public notice or additional coordination with appropriate Federal
and/or state agencies. The provisional decision document will be supplemented or may be completely rewritten, as
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Denial: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the State denies the Section 401 Water Quality Certification and/or the State nonconcurs with the applicant's
CZM consistency determination, then the Corps permit is denied without prejudice.

Enclosed is a ``PROVISIONAL PERMIT.'' The provisional permit is NOT VALID and does not authorize you to do your work.
The provisional permit describes the work that will be authorized, and the General and Special Conditions [if any]
which will be placed on your final Department of the Army (DA) permit, if the State of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Water Quality Certification and/or Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency requirements are satisfied as described
below. No work is to be performed in the waterway or adjacent wetlands until you have received a validated copy of the
DA permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By Federal law no DA permit can be issued until a State Section 401 Water Quality Certification has been issued or has
been waived and/or the State has concurred with a permit applicant's CZM consistency determination or concurrence
has been presumed. As of this date the [State 401 certification agency] has not issued a Section 401 Water Quality Certification
for your proposed work. If the [State 401 certification agency] fails or refuses to act by [date 401 certification
must be issued] the Section 401 Water Quality Certification requirement will be automatically waived. Also, as of
this date the [State CZM agency] has not concurred with your CZM consistency determination. If the State does not act
by [six months from receipt by the State of the applicant's CZM consistency determination] then concurrence with
your CZM consistency determination will automatically be presumed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conditions of the State Section 401 Water Quality Certification and/or the State CZM concurrence will become conditions
to the final DA permit. Should the State's action on the required certification or concurrence preclude validation
of the provisional permit in its current form, a modification to the provisional permit will be evaluated and you will
be notified as appropriate. Substantial changes may require a new permit evaluation process, including issuing
a new public notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the appropriate level of analysis required for evaluating compliance
with the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines' (Guidelines) requirements for consideration of alternatives.
40 CFR 230.10(a). Specifically, this memorandum describes the flexibility afforded by the Guidelines to make regulatory
decisions based on the relative severity of the environmental impact of proposed discharges of dredged or fill material
into waters of the United States.

2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Guidelines are the substantive environmental standards by which all Section 404 permit applications are evaluated.
The Guidelines, which are binding regulations, were published by the Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR part
230 on December 24, 1980. The fundamental precept of the Guidelines is that discharges of dredged or fill material
into waters of the United States, including wetlands, should not occur unless it can be demonstrated that such discharges,
either individually or cumulatively, will not result in unacceptable adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem.
The Guidelines specifically require that ``no discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is
a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem,
so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences.'' 40 CFR 230.10(a).
Based on this provision, the applicant is required in every case (irrespective of whether the discharge site is a special
aquatic site or whether the activity associated with the discharge is water dependent) to evaluate opportunities
for use of non-aquatic areas and other aquatic sites that would result in less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem.
A permit cannot be issued, therefore, in circumstances where a less environmentally damaging practicable alternative
for the proposed discharge exists (except as provided for under Section 404(b)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Guidelines are, as noted above, binding regulations. It is important to recognize, however, that this regulatory
status does not limit the inherent flexibility provided in the Guidelines for implementing these provisions. The
preamble to the Guidelines is very clear in this regard:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Of course, as the regulation itself makes clear, a certain amount of flexibility is still intended. For example, while
the ultimate conditions of compliance are ``regulatory'', the Guidelines allow some room for judgment in determining
what must be done to arrive at a conclusion that those conditions have or have not been met.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding this flexibility, the record must contain sufficient information to demonstrate that the proposed
discharge complies with the requirements of Section 230.10(a) of the Guidelines. The amount of information needed
to make a determination and the level of scrutiny required by the Guidelines is commensurate with the severity of the
environmental impact (as determined by the functions of the aquatic resource and the nature of the proposed activity)
and the scope/cost of the project.

a. Analysis Associated With Minor Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Guidelines do not contemplate that the same intensity of analysis will be required for all types of projects but
instead envision a correlation between the scope of the evaluation and the potential extent of adverse impacts on
the aquatic environment. The introduction to &sect;230.10(a) recognizes that the level of analysis required may
vary with the nature and complexity of each individual case:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Although all requirements in &sect;230.10 must be met, the compliance evaluation procedures will vary to reflect
the seriousness of the potential for adverse impacts on the aquatic ecosystems posed by specific dredged or fill material
discharge activities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, &sect;230.6 (``Adaptability'') makes clear that the Guidelines:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Allow evaluation and documentation for a variety of activities, ranging from those large, complex impacts on the
aquatic environment to those for which the impact is likely to be innocuous. It is unlikely that the Guidelines will
apply in their entirety to any one activity, no matter how complex. It is anticipated that substantial numbers of permit
applications will be for minor, routine activities that have little, if any, potential for significant degradation
of the aquatic environment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
It generally is not intended or expected that extensive testing, evaluation or analysis will be needed to make findings
of compliance in such routine cases.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 230.6 also emphasizes that when making determinations of compliance with the Guidelines, users:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Must recognize the different levels of effort that should be associated with varying degrees of impact and require
or prepare commensurate documentation. The level of documentation should reflect the significance and complexity
of the discharge activity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consequently, the Guidelines clearly afford flexibility to adjust the stringency of the alternatives review for
projects that would have only minor impacts. Minor impacts are associated with activities that generally would have
little potential to degrade the aquatic environment and include one, and frequently more, of the following characteristics:
Are located in aquatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources of limited natural function; are small in size and cause little direct impact; have little potential for
secondary or cumulative impacts; or cause only temporary impacts. It is important to recognize, however, that in
some circumstances even small or temporary fills result in substantial impacts, and that in such cases a more detailed
evaluation is necessary. The Corps Districts and EPA Regions will, through the standard permit evaluation process,
coordinate with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service and other appropriate state
and Federal agencies in evaluating the likelihood that adverse impacts would result from a particular proposal.
It is not appropriate to consider compensatory mitigation in determining whether a proposed discharge will cause
only minor impacts for purposes of the alternatives analysis required by &sect;230.10(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing projects that have the potential for only minor impacts on the aquatic environment, Corps and EPA field
offices are directed to consider, in coordination with state and Federal resource agencies, the following factors:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Such projects by their nature should not cause or contribute to significant degradation individually or cumulatively.
Therefore, it generally should not be necessary to conduct or require detailed analyses to determine compliance
with &sect;230.10(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Although sufficient information must be developed to determine whether the proposed activity is in fact the
least damaging practicable alternative, the Guidelines do not require an elaborate search for practicable alternatives
if it is reasonably anticipated that there are only minor differences between the environmental impacts of the proposed
activity and potentially practicable alternatives. This decision will be made after consideration of resource
agency comments on the proposed project. It often makes sense to examine first whether potential alternatives would
result in no identifiable or discernible difference in impact on the aquatic ecosystem. Those alternatives that
do not may be eliminated from the analysis since &sect;230.10(a) of the Guidelines only prohibits discharges when
a practicable alternative exists which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem. Because evaluating
practicability is generally the more difficult aspect of the alternatives analysis, this approach should save time
and effort for both the applicant and the regulatory agencies.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 By initially focusing the alternatives analysis on the question of impacts on the aquatic ecosystem, it may be possible
to limit (or in some instances eliminate altogether) the number of alternatives that have to be evaluated for practicability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
In certain instances, however, it may be easier to examine practicability first. Some projects may be so site-specific
(e.g., erosion control, bridge replacement) that no offsite alternative could be practicable. In such cases the
alternatives analysis may appropriately be limited to onsite options only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(iii) When it is determined that there is no identifiable or discernible difference in adverse impact on the environment
between the applicant's proposed alternative and all other practicable alternatives, then the applicant's alternative
is considered as satisfying the requirements of Section 230.10(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Even where a practicable alternative exists that would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, the
Guidelines allow it to be rejected if it would have ``other significant adverse environmental consequences.'' 40
CFR 230.10(a). As explained in the preamble, this allows for consideration of ``evidence of damages to other ecosystems
in deciding whether there is a `better' alternative.'' Hence, in applying the alternatives analysis required by
the Guidelines, it is not appropriate to select an alternative where minor impacts on the aquatic environment are
avoided at the cost of substantial impacts to other natural environmental values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) In cases of negligible or trivial impacts (e.g., small discharges to construct individual driveways), it may
be possible to conclude that no alternative location could result in less adverse impact on the aquatic environment
within the meaning of the Guidelines. In such cases, it may not be necessary to conduct an offsite alternatives analysis
but instead require only any practicable onsite minimization.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This guidance concerns application of the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines to projects with minor impacts. Projects
which may cause more than minor impacts on the aquatic environment, either individually or cumulatively, should
be subjected to a proportionately more detailed level of analysis to determine compliance or noncompliance with
the Guidelines. Projects which cause substantial impacts, in particular, must be thoroughly evaluated through
the standard permit evaluation process to determine compliance with all provisions of the Guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Relationship Between the Scope of Analysis and the Scope/Cost of the Proposed Project
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Guidelines provide the Corps and EPA with discretion for determining the necessary level of analysis to support
a conclusion as to whether or not an alternative is practicable. Practicable alternatives are those alternatives
that are ``available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics
in light of overall project purposes.'' 40 CFR 230.10(a)(2). The preamble to the Guidelines provides clarification
on how cost is to be considered in the determination of practicability:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Our intent is to consider those alternatives which are reasonable in terms of the overall scope/cost of the proposed
project. The term economic [for which the term ``cost'' was substituted in the final rule] might be construed to include
consideration of the applicant's financial standing, or investment, or market share, a cumbersome inquiry which
is not necessarily material to the objectives of the Guidelines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Therefore, the level of analysis required for determining which alternatives are practicable will vary depending
on the type of project proposed. The determination of what constitutes an unreasonable expense should generally
consider whether the projected cost is substantially greater than the costs normally associated with the particular
type of project. Generally, as the scope/cost of the project increases, the level of analysis should also increase.
To the extent the Corps obtains information on the costs associated with the project, such information may be considered
when making a determination of what constitutes an unreasonable expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble to the Guidelines also states that ``[i]f an alleged alternative is unreasonably expensive to the applicant,
the alternative is not `practicable.''' Guidelines Preamble, ``Economic Factors'', 45 FR 85343 (December 24, 1980).
Therefore, to the extent that individual homeowners and small businesses may typically be associated with small
projects with minor impacts, the nature of the applicant may also be a relevant consideration in determining what
constitutes a practicable alternative. It is important to emphasize, however, that it is not a particular applicant's
financial standing that is the primary consideration for determining practicability, but rather characteristics
of the project and what constitutes a reasonable expense for these projects that are most relevant to practicability
determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The burden of proof to demonstrate compliance with the Guidelines rests with the applicant; where insufficient
information is provided to determine compliance, the Guidelines require that no permit be issued. 40 CFR 230.12(a)(3)(iv).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A reasonable, common sense approach in applying the requirements of the Guidelines' alternatives analysis is
fully consistent with sound environmental protection. The Guidelines clearly contemplate that reasonable discretion
should be applied based on the nature of the aquatic resource and potential impacts of a proposed activity in determining
compliance with the alternatives test. Such an approach encourages effective decisionmaking and fosters a better
understanding and enhanced confidence in the Section 404 program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. This guidance is consistent with the February 6, 1990 ``Memorandum of Agreement Between the Environmental Protection
Agency and the Department of the Army Concerning the Determination of Mitigation under the Clean Water Act Section
404(b)(1) Guidelines.''

1. This memorandum provides general guidelines for the establishment and use of wetland mitigation banks in the Clean
Water Act Section 404 regulatory program. This memorandum serves as interim guidance pending completion of Phase
I by the Corps of Engineer's Institute for Water Resources study on wetland mitigation banking,

The Corps of Engineers Institute for Water Resources, under the authority of Section 307(d) of the Water Resources
Development Act of 1990, is undertaking a comprehensive two-year review and evaluation of wetland mitigation banking
to assist in the development of a national policy on this issue. The interim summary report documenting the results
of the first phase of the study is scheduled for completion in the fall of 1993.

2. For purposes of this guidance, wetland mitigation banking refers to the restoration, creation, enhancement,
and, in exceptional circumstances, preservation of wetlands or other aquatic habitats expressly for the purpose
of providing compensatory mitigation in advance of discharges into wetlands permitted under the Section 404 regulatory
program. Wetland mitigation banks can have several advantages over individual mitigation projects, some of which
are listed below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Compensatory mitigation can be implemented and functioning in advance of project impacts, thereby reducing
temporal losses of wetland functions and uncertainty over whether the mitigation will be successful in offsetting
wetland losses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) It may be more ecologically advantageous for maintaining the integrity of the aquatic ecosystem to consolidate
compensatory mitigation for impacts to many smaller, isolated or fragmented habitats into a single large parcel
or contiguous parcels.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Development of a wetland mitigation bank can bring together financial resources and planning and scientific
expertise not practicable to many individual mitigation proposals. This consolidation of resources can increase
the potential for the establishment and long-term management of successful mitigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Wetland mitigation banking proposals may reduce regulatory uncertainty and Provide more cost-effective compensatory
mitigation opportunities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines), as clarified by the ``Memorandum of Agreement Concerning the
Determination of Mitigation under the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines'' (Mitigation (MOA) signed February 6, 1990,
by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army, establish a mitigation sequence that is used
in the evaluation of individual permit applications. Under this sequence, all appropriate and practicable steps
must be undertaken by the applicant to first avoid and then minimize adverse impacts to the aquatic ecosystem. Remaining
unavoidable impacts must then be offset through compensatory mitigation to the extent appropriate and practicable.
Requirements for compensatory mitigation may be satisfied through the use of wetland mitigation banks, so long as
their use is consistent with standard practices for evaluating compensatory mitigation proposals outlined in the
Mitigation MOA. It is important to emphasize that, given the mitigation sequence requirements described above,
permit applicants should not anticipate that the establishment of, or participation in, a wetland mitigation bank
will ultimately lead to a determination of compliance with the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines without adequate demonstration
that impacts associated with the proposed discharge have been avoided and minimized to the extent practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The agencies' preference for on-site, in-kind compensatory mitigation does not preclude the use of wetland mitigation
banks where it has been determined by the Corps, or other appropriate permitting agency, in coordination with the
Federal resource agencies through the standard permit evaluation process, that the use of a particular mitigation
bank as compensation for proposed wetland impacts would be appropriate for offsetting impacts to the aquatic ecosystem.
In making such a determination, careful consideration must be given to wetland functions, landscape position, and
affected species populations at both the impact and mitigation bank sites. In addition, compensation for wetland
impacts should occur, where appropriate and practicable, within the same watershed as the impact site. Where a mitigation
bank is being developed in conjunction with a wetland resource planning initiative (e.g., Special Area Management
Plan, State Wetland Conservation Plan) to satisfy particular wetland restoration objectives, the permitting agency
will determine, in coordination with the Federal resource agencies, whether use of the bank should be considered
an appropriate form of compensatory mitigation for impacts occurring within the same watershed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Wetland mitigation banks should generally be in place and functional before credits may be used to offset permitted
wetland losses. However, it may be appropriate to allow incremental distribution of credits corresponding to the
appropriate stage of successful establishment of wetland functions. Moreover, variable mitigation ratios (credit
acreage to impacted wetland acreage) may be used in such circumstances to reflect the wetland functions attained
at a bank site at a particular point in time. For example, higher ratios would be required when a bank is not yet fully
functional at the time credits are to be withdrawn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Establishment of each mitigation bank should be accompanied by the development of a formal written agreement (e.g.,
memorandum of agreement) among the Corps, EPA, other relevant resource agencies, and those parties who will own,
develop, operate or otherwise participate in the bank. The purpose of the agreement is to establish clear guidelines
for establishment and use of the mitigation bank. A wetlands mitigation bank may also be established through issuance
of a Section 404 permit where establishing the proposed bank involves a discharge of dredged or fill material into
waters of the United States. The banking agreement or, where applicable, special conditions of the permit establishing
the bank should address the following considerations, where appropriate:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Location of the mitigation bank;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

7. An appropriate methodology, acceptable to all signatories, should be identified and used to evaluate the success
of wetland restoration and creation efforts within the mitigation bank and to identify the appropriate stage of development
for issuing mitigation credits. A full range of wetland functions should be assessed. Functional evaluations of
the mitigation bank should generally be conducted by a multi-disciplinary team representing involved resource
and regulatory agencies and other appropriate parties. The same methodology should be used to determine the functions
and values of both credits and debits. As an alternative, credits and debits can be based on acres of various types of
wetlands (e.g., National Wetland Inventory classes). Final determinations regarding debits and credits will be
made by the Corps, or other appropriate permitting agency, in consultation with Federal resource agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Permit applicants may draw upon the available credits of a third party mitigation bank (i.e., a bank developed and
operated by an entity other than the permit applicant). The section 404 permit, however, must state explicitly that
the permittee remains responsible for ensuring that the mitigation requirements are satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. To ensure legal enforceability of the mitigation conditions, use of mitigation bank credits must be conditioned
in the section 404 permit by referencing the banking agreement or section 404 permit establishing the bank; however,
such a provision should not limit the responsibility of the section 404 permittee for satisfying all legal requirements
of the permit.

DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(G), it intends to award a grant in the amount of $50,000 to the
National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) in support of scientific evaluation work in operational
radiation protection, radionuclides in the environment, guidance on occupational and public exposure resulting
from diagnostic nuclear medicine procedures, and practical guidance on the evaluation of human exposures to radiofrequency
radiation. Pursuant to Public law 88&hyph;376, the NCRP was chartered to collect, analyze, develop, and disseminate
in the public interest information and recommendations pertaining to radiation protection. The NCRP's cooperation
with national and international organizations, governmental and private, ensures that the recommendations provided
incorporate the latest scientific information for the protection of radiation workers and members of the general
public. Under this grant award, the NCRP seeks to provide guidance and recommendations that will minimize human exposure
and, thus, reduce health effects of radiation. Eligibility for this award is therefore restricted to NCRP.

MRT states that the purpose of the instant filing is to revise the Gas Supply Realignment Cost (GSRC) Surcharges applicable
to Rate Schedules FTS and SCT originally filed by MRT on December 1, 1993 and accepted by Commission order dated December
30, 1993 in Docket No. RP94&hyph;68. MRT states that the revised GSRC Surcharges proposed reflect (1) the use of the
additional billing determinants associated with the seasonal southbound contracts in the surcharge derivation,
and (2) a revised allocation of GSRC between MRT's Market Zone and Field Zone based on the proportion of MRT's fixed
transmission cost of service allocated to each zone as set forth in the January 14, 1994 filing in Docket Nos. RS92&hyph;43
and RP93&hyph;4.

(CMS); notification of the date of the initial performance test; and the results of the initial performance test.
The owner or operator is also required to maintain records of the occurrence and duration of any startup, shutdown,
or malfunction in the operation of an affected facility, or any period during which the monitoring system is inoperative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The owner or operator of electric arc furnaces controlled by a direct shell evacuation system must install and maintain
a continuous monitoring device that continuously records pressure inside the electric arc furnaces (EAF), and records
15 minute integrated averages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The owner or operator must also submit semiannual reports of unacceptable operation of the affected facilities,
and semiannual reports of exceedances of control device opacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notifications and reports enable EPA or the delegated State to determine that best demonstrated technology is
installed and properly operated and maintained and to schedule inspections.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Title VII of the ``Business Opportunity Development Act of 1988'' (Pub. L. 100&hyph;656) established the Small Business
Competitiveness Demonstration Program and designated ten (10) agencies, including the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), to conduct the program over a four (4) year period from January 1, 1989 to December 31, 1992. The Small
Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;366) extended the demonstration program until September
30, 1996, and made certain changes in the procedures for operation of the demonstration program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The law designated four (4) industry groups for testing whether the competitive capabilities of the specified industry
groups will enable them to compete successfully on an unrestricted basis. The four (4) industry groups are: Construction
(except dredging); architectural and engineering (A&amp;E) services (including surveying and mapping); refuse
systems and related services (limited to trash/garbage collection services); and non-nuclear ship repair. Under
the program, when a participating agency does not meet its small business participation goal, small business set-asides
must be reinstated in the particular industry group. If small business goals are achieved in subsequent quarters,
the agency may cancel the set-asides and return to full and open competition. The small business goal is 40 percent
of the total contract dollars awarded for construction, trash/garbage collection services, and non-nuclear ship
repair and 35 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for architect-engineer services. The program reserves
for emerging small businesses procurements under $25,000 for construction, trash/garbage collection services,
and non-nuclear ship repair, and under $50,000 for architect-engineer services.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 26, 1993, the Regional Administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region I, approved
the State of Vermont's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit Program. On April
22, 1993, the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (Vermont ANR) submitted a formal request for approval to revise
its NPDES Permit Program to authorize the issuance of general NPDES permits. This action authorizes the State of Vermont
to issue general permits in lieu of individual NPDES permits. Based on its review of Vermont's legal authority, EPA
determined that no statutory or regulatory changes were necessary for the State to administer a general permit program.
EPA has thus determined Vermont's program modification to be non-substantial.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA regulations at 40 CFR 122.28 provide for the issuance of general permits to regulate the discharge of wastewater
which results from substantially similar operations, are of the same type wastes, require the same effluent limitations
or operating conditions, require similar monitoring and are more appropriately controlled under a general permit
rather than by individual permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vermont was authorized to administer the NPDES program on March 11, 1974. As previously approved, the State's program
did not include provisions for the issuance of general permits. A number of categories of discharges can be appropriately
regulated by general permits. For these reasons, the Vermont ANR requested a revision of the State's NPDES program
to provide for the issuance of general permits. The categories proposed for coverage under the general permit program
include: Storm water discharges, non-contact cooling water, non-pollution discharges and classes of discharges
where individual permits for such a class would be substantially similar. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each general permit will be subject to EPA review and approval as provided by 40 CFR 123.44. Public notice and opportunity
to request a hearing is also provided for each general permit.

II. Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Vermont submitted in support of its request a program description, an Amendment to the Memorandum of Agreement,
and copies of the relevant statutes and regulations for implementing the program. In addition, the State submitted
a statement, dated November 20, 1992, by the Attorney General certifying, with appropriate citations to the statutes
and regulations, that the State has adequate legal authority to administer the general permit program as required
by 40 CFR 123.23(c). The program description supplementing the original application for the NPDES program authority
to administer the general permit program includes the authority to perform each of the activities set forth in 40 CFR
122.28. The Amendment to the Memorandum of Agreement between the State of Vermont ANR and EPA, Region I designates
the procedures through which general permits will be issued and administered by the State. Based upon Vermont's program
description and upon its experience in administering an approved NPDES program, EPA has concluded that the State
will have the necessary procedures and resources to administer the general permit program.

IV. Review Under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the review requirements of Executive Order 12291 pursuant
to section 8(b) of that Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules
which may have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Pursuant to section 605(d) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), I certify that this State General Permit Program will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities. Approval of the Vermont NPDES State General Permit Program establishes no new substantive requirements,
nor does it alter the regulatory control over any industrial category. Approval of the Vermont NPDES State General
Permits Program merely provides a simplified administrative process.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (53 FR 11979, 11986).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Public Law 100&hyph;71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged
in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct
urine drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of
performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in
an every-other-month performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are not to be considered as meeting the minimum
requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter of certification from SAMHSA, HHS
(formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Kobuk District Office, Alaska, is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement
for the study of the Squirrel River for possible inclusion in the national wild and scenic rivers system. The Notice
of Intent to proceed with the EIS was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 29, 1993. Because of a delay for communities in northwestern Alaska receiving notice of the comment period
for scoping on the EIS, the period for public comment is extended until 30 days from the publication of this Notice.
These comments and others will be used in preparation of a draft EIS. An additional opportunity for public comment
will be held after the draft EIS is published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Squirrel River study was authorized by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of December 2, 1980
(ANILCA, Pub. L. 96&hyph;487). The Squirrel River, a tributary of the Kobuk River in northwest Alaska, was studied
in 1985 by the National Park Service (NPS) for possible inclusion in the national wild and scenic river system. After
publication of a draft EIS, further action by NPS was deferred for several reasons. One of these reasons included the
delegation of authority to BLM to conduct wild and scenic river studies on rivers under its management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action in the NPS study called for designation of the federally-administered portion of the Squirrel
River, plus the lower 6 miles of the river's North Fork and the lower 15 miles of the Omar River. BLM is now proceeding
at the scoping level in order to obtain maximum public input on the study. Preliminary review of the draft EIS published
by NPS in 1985 indicates potential issues may now include mineral development in the region, identification of transportation
corridors, and subsistence lifeways in the area. Information received as a result of current scoping on this action
will be used to update the NPS draft EIS and produce a new Squirrel River draft EIS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
At the request of Congress, the Department of Labor is conducting a review of the federal-state labor market information
system. This notice requests comments from interested persons and organizations. The labor market information
system is a cooperative effort involving the Department of Labor, state employment security agencies and other federal
and state organizations. With federal funding and assistance, state agencies gather and disseminate information
on employment, unemployment, the labor force, labor market trends, and job opportunities.

The review will address user needs, legislative mandates, funding, coordination and management of the system, and
the reliability of state and local labor force estimates. The review will also include proposals regarding overall
policy and the future direction of the labor market information system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 221 of the Trade Act of 1974, an investigation was initiated on November 15, 1993, in response to
a worker petition which was filed on November 15, 1993, on behalf of workers at Grove Communications, MGM Tower, Inc.,
and Grove Company, Inc., Williston, North Dakota.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All workers were separated from the subject firm more than one year prior to the date of the petition. Section 223 of
the Act specifies that no certification may apply to any worker whose last separation occurred more than one year before
the date of the petition. Consequently, further investigation in this case would serve no purpose, and the investigation
has been terminated.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has recently submitted to the OMB for review the following proposal for the collection of information under
the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Type of submission, new, revision, or extension: Revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The title of the information collection: Reactor Operator and Senior Reactor Operator Licensing Training and
Requalification Programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The form number if applicable: N/A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. How often the collection is required: Upon request by the NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Who will be required or asked to report: Power and non-power reactor licensees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. An estimate of the number of annual responses: 8 for power reactors and 4 for non-power reactors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. An estimate of the total number of hours needed to complete the requirement or request: 32 hours annually for power
reactors (approximately 4 hours per response) and 2 hours annually for non-power reactors (approximately 0.5 hours
per response). There is an overall reduction of 358 hours (3.3 hours per licensee) because licensees will no longer
submit material for NRC preparation of requalification examinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. An indication of whether section 3504(h), Public Law 96&hyph;511 applies: Not applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Abstract: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations at 10 CFR part 55 to: (1) Delete the
prerequisite for license renewal that each licensed operator pass a comprehensive requalification written examination
and an operating test conducted by the NRC during the term of the operator's 6-year license, (2) require facility licensees
to submit upon request copies of each annual operating test or comprehensive written examination used for operator
requalification to the NRC for review, and (3) amend the ``Scope'' provisions of the regulations pertaining to operators'
licenses to include facility licensees. This information is needed to monitor licensed operator performance and
to support the Commission's inspection program. It is concluded that these amendments will result in a substantial
increase in the overall protection of public health and safety.

<DOCTITLE>Philadelphia Electric Co., et al.; Notice of Issuance of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR&hyph;44 and DPR&hyph;56, issued to the Philadelphia Electric Company, et al. (the licensee), for
operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3, located in York County, Pennsylvania.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would consist of changes to the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3, operating
licenses DPR&hyph;44 and DPR&hyph;56, respectively, to extend the expiration dates of the operating licenses from
January 31, 2008 to August 8, 2013 and July 2, 2014, respectively. The amendments are in response to the licensee's
application dated May 21, 1992. The revised dates provide for a licensed operating period of 40 years from issuance
of the respective unit operating license. The Commission's staff has prepared an environment assessment of the proposed
action, ``Environmental Assessment by the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation Related to the Change in the Expiration
Date of Facility Operating Licenses DPR&hyph;44 and DPR&hyph;56, Philadelphia Electric Company, Public Service
Electric and Gas Company, Delmarva Power and Light Company, Atlantic City Electric Company, Peach Bottom Atomic
Power Station, Units 2 and 3,'' dated January 24, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the potential environmental impact of the proposed change in the expiration dates of the
operating licenses for Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3 (Peach Bottom, Units 2 and 3). The staff reviewed
the ``Final Environmental Statement Related to Operation of Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Units 2 and 3,'' dated
April 1973 (FES) and the information provided in the licensee's May 21, 1992 license amendment application to determine
if any significant environmental impacts, other than those previously considered, would be associated with the
proposed license extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Radiological Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff concludes that, although the population in the vicinity of Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station has increased,
the population growth was less than projections provided in the FES. Based on updated census information and updated
population growth estimates, the existing FES is expected to remain bounding with respect to population projections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Station radiological effluents to unrestricted areas during normal operation have been well within Commission
regulations regarding ``as low as reasonably achievable'' (ALARA) limits and are expected to remain within ALARA
limits. Based on the continued operation of existing liquid and gaseous radwaste treatment systems coupled with
the current radiological monitoring program, the NRC staff anticipates liquid and gaseous effluent doses during
the period covered by the requested amendment will remain a fraction of the 10 CFR part 50, Appendix I, limits and will
not adversely impact the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to normal plant operation, occupational radiation exposures to personnel have decreased as a result
of recent plant improvements. Further reductions in radiation dose rates are expected as a result of the ALARA program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the NRC staff concludes that, as a result of the license extension, the radiological impact on the general
public would not increase over that previously evaluated in the FES and the occupational exposure will be at least
consistent with the industry average and in accordance with 10 CFR Part 20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has in the past concluded that the environmental impacts associated with the uranium fuel cycle are very
small when compared with the dose commitments resulting from natural background sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental impacts attributable to transportation of fuel and waste to and from Peach Bottom Atomic Power
Station, with respect to normal conditions of transport and possible accidents in transport, would be founded as
set forth in Summary Table S&hyph;4 of 10 CFR 51.52. The values in Table S&hyph;4 would continue to represent the contribution
of transportation to the environmental costs associated with reactor operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Nonradiological Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has concluded that the proposed extension would not cause a significant increase in the nonradiological
impact to the environment and would not change any conclusions previously reached by the NRC staff.

Alternate Use of Resources

This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the FES.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the proposed change to the expiration dates of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units
2 and 3 operating licenses relative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR part 51. Based on the environmental assessment,
the Commission concluded that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological impacts associated with
the proposed action and that the proposed license amendment will not have a significant effect on the quality of the
human environment. Therefore, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see: (1) The application for amendment dated May 21, 1992; (2) the
``Final Environmental Statement Related to Operation of Peach Bottom Power Station, Units 2 and 3,'' issued April
1973; and (3) the Environmental Assessment dated January 24, 1994.

This draft policy statement presents the criteria the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to follow
in addressing requests from power reactor licensees that have permanently shut down their power reactors to make
withdrawals from external decommissioning sinking funds to pay for the removal of components and other decommissioning-related
activities before the NRC approves these licensees' decommissioning plans submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.82. This

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The NRC decommissioning regulations in 10 CFR 50.75 and 50.82 are silent on whether approval of the decommissioning
plan must precede withdrawals from the decommissioning trust fund. Appendix B.3.1, p. B&hyph;12 of Regulatory Guide
1.159, ``Assuring the Availability of Funds for Decommissioning Nuclear Reactors,'' contains sample trust language
that indicates that the fund trustee should only release funds upon certification ``that decommissioning is proceeding
pursuant to an NRC-approved plan.'' However, not all licensees have used this sample language. When the NRC evaluated
trust funds as part of the initial certification required by 10 CFR 50.75(b) and submitted in July 1990, it found trusts
acceptable if, along with other provisions, they contained language limiting trust fund withdrawals to legitimate
decommissioning purposes. Thus, many licensees have acceptable trusts that nevertheless do not expressly limit
the withdrawal of trust funds before NRC approves a decommissioning plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Because of a request by Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and in anticipation of future requests by other power reactor licensees of permanently shutdown facilities, the
Commission directed the NRC staff to provide an analysis and recommendation to the Commission on permitting licensees
to use their decommissioning funds for decommissioning activities prior to approval of the decommissioning plans.
The Commission approved the criteria developed by the staff to evaluate early withdrawals from external decommissioning
sinking funds and directed the staff to publish the details of this policy in the

In a letter to the Commission dated November 25, 1992, YAEC stated its intention to use its decommissioning trust funds
to remove reactor core internals, steam generators and the pressurizer from Yankee-Rowe before the NRC approves
YAEC's decommissioning plan. (YAEC plans to submit its decommissioning plan for NRC review in late 1993.) By letter
dated April 16, 1993, the NRC did not object to YAEC's proposed use of decommissioning trust funds before NRC approval
of the Yankee-Rowe decommissioning plan, using criteria consistent with those discussed in this policy statement.

Statement of Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a licensee of a permanently shutdown facility spends decomissioning trust funds on legitimate decommissioning
activities, the timing of these expenditures, either before or after NRC approves a licensee's decommissioning
plan, should not adversely affect public health and safety, provided adequate funds are maintained to restore the
facility to a safe storage configuration in case decommissioning activities are interrupted unexpectedly. Consequently,
the timing of the NRC review of a licensee's decommissioning plan in relation to withdrawals from trust funds is not
as important as the purpose of those withdrawals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its decommissioning plan reviews, the NRC evaluates proposed licensee activities in the planned decommissioning
process to determine whether the proposed plan adequately ensures protection of public health and safety. The NRC
will also assess a licensee's overall decommissioning fund balance in relation to total cost. The NRC review of decommissioning
costs is focused on seeing that they fall within a normal range of costs and is not focused on examining the timing, scope,
and cost of specific component removal or other decommissioning activities. Therefore, although the NRC believes
that it should guard against misuse or waste of decommissioning trust funds by licensees, it is not clear that prior
NRC review of the decommissioning plan would identify such misuse or waste unless it resulted in costs far higher than
would normally be expected. The NRC would find it difficult to identify the misuse of funds if a licensee's estimates
were within a reasonable range of the costs estimated for similar facilities. Further, the NRC does not supervise
or review the actual expenditure of funds during decommissioning and would not have an opportunity to identify serious
cost overruns that might jeopardize the adequacy of funding available for remaining decommissioning activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, there appears to be little motivation for utilities to misuse these funds. Most NRC power reactor licensees
are subject to rate regulation by State public utility commissions (PUCs) or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC). Utilities are normally allowed to earn a return on assets, including nuclear plants, once they are determined
to be ``used and useful'' and placed in the rate base. Decommissioning costs, however, are normally treated by PUCs
and FERC as non-rate-base expenses. They are passed on to ratepayers as expenses, but the utility and its stockholders
do not earn a return on these collections. Consequently, there is little financial incentive for a licensee to ``pad''
or dissipate collected decommissioning funds to increase the rate base, because the stockholders would not benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, PUCs and FERC are unlikely to allow utilities under their jurisdictions to squander funds obtained from
ratepayers. Rate regulators hold prudency reviews to determine whether utilities have spent funds properly throughout
all aspects of plant operation, from initial planning to final decommissioning. The NRC expects that PUCs and FERC
will continue to exercise their oversight of utilities' expenditures, including those being paid from decommissioning
trust funds, throughout the decommissioning process. A utility has an incentive to spend decommissioning funds
prudently if it knows that its stockholders will be liable for decommissioning costs in excess of those already collected
from ratepayers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although NRC approval of the decommissioning plan does not ensure prevention of misuse or waste of decomissioning
funds, the NRC believes that withdrawal of funds for decommissioning activities before a decommissioning plan is
developed and approved should require NRC review. This is consistent with Commission guidance which provided that
the staff may permit licensees to use their decommissioning funds for the decommissioning permitted above (as the
term decommission is defined in 10 CFR 50.2), notwithstanding the fact that their decommissioning plans have not
yet been approved by the NRC.

Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The criteria and supporting rationale developed to evaluate licensee proposals for early withdrawals from external
decommissioning sinking funds are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The withdrawals are for expenses for legitimate decommissioning activities as defined in 10 CFR 50.2 that would
necessarily occur under most reasonable decommissioning scenarios. Section 10 CFR 50.2 defines ``decommission''
as meaning ``to remove (as a facility) safely from service and reduce residual radioactivity to a level that permits
release of the property for unrestricted use and termination of licensee.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<PARENT> FR940203-2-00057 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This criterion calls for a licensee to demonstrate that the early withdrawal is for activities that would occur under
reasonable decommissioning scenarios and would prevent funds being used for activities that do not reduce radioactivity
at the site and ultimately permit release of the property for unrestricted use. A licensee that has already prepared
its &sect;50.82 decommissioning plan (which must be submitted within 2 years after a permanent cessation of operations)
could reference the appropriate part of this plan. A licensee that has not yet completed its &sect;50.82 decommissioning
plan would have to provide other documentation to demonstrate that its proposed activities were clearly decommissioning
activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The expenditures would not reduce the value of the decommissioning trust below an amount necessary to place and
maintain the licensee's reactor in a safe storage (SAFSTOR) condition if unforeseen conditions or expenses arise.
(For example, if the waste shipments were rejected by the disposal site because of lack of storage space or legal impediments,
a licensee would have to show it had the funds to return and store any affected components on site and to store any radioactive
components and materials that had remained on-site.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the purpose of the decommissioning funding regulations, assurance of availability of funds to safely
decommission a facility, and the principle that a preapproval activity does not foreclose the release of the site
for possible unrestricted use, this criterion calls for a licensee to show that it can maintain the status quo at a facility
and that the proposed activities will not preclude the ultimate unrestricted use of the site. A licensee would have
to document the rationale for the minimum amount estimated to be needed to return to a safe storage condition if decontamination
or removal activities are interrupted and the components and equipment involved have to be stored safely at the site.
Such on-site storage after shipment could, in the worst case, require construction of a storage facility. This criterion
ensures that decommissioning activities that occur before approval of the &sect;50.82 decommissioning plan do
not reduce funds below a level that would ensure continued maintenance of safety at a defueled, shutdown facility
until the decommissioning plan is reviewed and approved. A licensee could satisfy this criterion by demonstrating
that it has sufficient funds in either its decommissioning fund or other available funds to maintain the status quo
at the facility, that is, maintain safety in the defueled, shutdown condition. It should be noted that this criterion
is also pertinent to the normal, end-of-life decommissioning; licensees are to accommodate the possibility of unforeseen
occurrences by providing for contingencies. (See Regulatory Guide 1.159 at 1.159&hyph;10, Item 1.4.4.3. The general
guidance of Regulatory Guide 1.159 concerning provisions for ``contingencies,'' however, does not explicitly
identify the nature of such contingencies. The NRC's proposed criterion is more explicit.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC notes that 10 CFR 50.82(c)(1) requires that, ``funds needed to complete decommissioning be placed into an
account segregated from licensee assets and outside the licensee's administrative control during the storage or
surveillance period, or a surety method or fund statement of intent be maintained in accordance with the criteria
of &sect;50.75(e).'' Because the definition of decommissioning in 10 CFR 50.2 implicitly includes the costs of placing
and maintaining a reactor in safe storage, a licensee should continue to provide assurance of adequate funds for these
expenses at all times during the SAFSTOR period. Thus, licensees are required to maintain this assurance both before
and after the NRC approves a licensee's &sect;50.82 decommissioning plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The withdrawals would not inhibit the ability of the licensee to complete funding of any shortfalls in the decommissioning
trust needed to ensure availability of funds to ultimately release the site for unrestricted use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This criterion encompasses the principle that activities allowed before approval of the decommissioning plan do
not significantly increase decommissioning costs. A licensee would be required to document the effect of the withdrawals
on the decommissioning funding plan, addressing the current fund balance and collection schedule, and demonstrate
that the use of funds before NRC approval of a decommissioning plan for the facility would not impair the licensee's
ability to fully fund the plan submitted to the NRC (or, if no plan has been filed, the actions necessary to permit release
of the site for unrestricted use). A licensee would, for example, have to show that the decommissioning actions potentially
taken out of sequence of any decommissioning plan submitted (or reasonable decommissioning alternatives if no plan
has been submitted) would not significantly increase decommissioning costs or impair its ability to obtain the funds
necessary to complete decommissioning.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Before the NRC approves a decommissioning plan, licensees can be allowed to undertake any decommissioning activity
(as the term ``decommission'' is defined in 10 CFR 50.2) that does not: (a) Foreclose the release of the site for possible
unrestricted use, (b) significantly increase decommissioning costs, (c) cause any significant environmental
impact not previously reviewed, or (d) violate the terms of the licensee's existing license (e.g., OL, POL, or OL with
confirmatory shutdown order) or 10 CFR 50.59 as applied to the existing license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This criterion seeks to ensure that funds are only used for those decommissioning activities that would be allowed
to proceed before the NRC approves a decommissioning plan. Items (a) and (b) have already been addressed by this policy
statement. For items (c) and (d), a licensee and the NRC would evaluate the proposed activity to ensure that the activity
may proceed under the current license and that the proposed activity will not result in any significant environmental
impact not previously reviewed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, the NRC may permit licensees to use their decommissioning funds for the decommissioning activities
permitted above (as the term ``decommission'' is defined in 10 CFR 50.2), notwithstanding the fact that their decommissioning
plans have not yet been approved by the NRC. After review of the licensee's proposed activities and fund withdrawal
using the above criteria, the NRC would permit the licensee to use decommissioning funds and to undertake the proposed
activities by tacitly consenting to the proposed withdrawals by not interposing, within a specified time, an objection
to the licensee's proposal. The NRC would need 60 days to complete an effective review of a licensee's proposal and
justification of how the above criteria will be met.

In the past, licensees have asked the NRC informally whether they would be able to withdraw funds from their trusts
to pay for developing the &sect;50.82 decommissioning plan and for other post-shutdown administrative expenses.
The NRC believes that these withdrawals should be allowed before the NRC approves the final decommissioning plan,
provided the licensee meets the following guidelines:

In talking informally with several licensees, the NRC understands that most licensees expect to spend from $1 million
to $3 million for completing decommissioning plans and for immediate post-shutdown administrative expenses. The
amount of $5 million, therefore, is based on a ``best-guess'' estimated, but is small enough not to significantly
deplete the decommissioning trust.

2. The decommissioning trust balance would not fall below an amount needed for safe storage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. The licensee provided for these costs in its site-specific decommissioning cost estimate and increased its overall
trust fund balances accordingly.

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 21, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one
establishing or changing a fee under section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the
Commission's receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD is proposing a rule change to Schedule A to the By-Laws to amend the amount of new application fees assessed
against firms other than self-clearing or introduction firms, from $1,500 to $3,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and the basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Article VI of the By-Laws of the NASD requires new members to pay an application fee based on reasonable expenses incurred
in carrying out the work of processing new membership applications. Pursuant to Schedule A, Section 2 to the By-Laws,
the NASD currently assesses a new application fee of $5,000 for self-clearing firms, $3,000 for introducing firms
and $1,500 for all firms other than self-clearing or introducing firms (``other'' firms).
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The average cost of processing new applications for other firms exceeds the revenue generated by the fee for such applications.
Currently, the NASD subsidizes the revenue shortfall for other firms from other fees and assessments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because there is no reasonable justification for subsidizing the initial entry of other firms into the industry,
the NASD is proposing to amend the application fee assessed against other firms to reflect more closely the actual
costs incurred in processing such applications. The average cost for processing new applications for other firms
is approximately the same as that for introducing firms. Therefore, the NASD is proposing to amend the amount of the
new application fee assessed against other firms in Schedule A, Section 2(i)(iii), which is currently $1,500, to
$3,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and
other charges among members in that the proposed rule change equitably adjusts the initial application fee so that
all new members are assessed their approximate entry costs.

Low Earth Orbit Space Market; Public Meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given of a public meeting called by the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Office of Commercial
Space Transportation (OCST) to obtain data specifically relating to the low earth orbit (LEO) space market. The meeting
is scheduled to take place on February 10, 1994, from 3&hyph;5 p.m., in the FAA Auditorium, located on the third floor
of the Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration Building, 800 Independence Ave., SW., Washington,
DC. The information obtained from this meeting will facilitate DOT's participation as a member of the Interagency
Working Groups on Space Transportation for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and on the
Department of Defense Space Launch Modernization Plan. DOT is also supporting efforts by the Office of the United
States Trade Representative (USTR) to monitor compliance by the Russian Federation with the recently concluded
U.S.-Russia commercial space launch trade agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCST seeks data that would assist in defining LEO launch requirements and in projecting future space transportation
needs to support market demands. Specifically, OCST is interested in obtaining LEO market projections, including
the number of payloads planned for launch between the years 1994&hyph;2010, and thereafter, and the kinds of services
that may be provided by LEO satellites and their applications (e.g., remote sensing, mobile communications). OCST
is also interested in obtaining long-range projections of the potential revenues that may be generated by these space-based
systems. Information on short-term (within the next 1&hyph;5 years) revenue projections should not be provided
at the meeting unless it is otherwise publicly available. Interested parties wishing to provide short-range revenue
projections not otherwise publicly available may do so in a written submission to OCST. This information will not
be publicly disclosed by OCST except in aggregate form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written submissions may be provided to OCST in addition to or in place of oral remarks presented at the public meeting.
Submissions designated as proprietary will be treated confidentially. Due to the immediate need for this data to
support the various DOT and Administration efforts, written submissions should be provided as quickly as possible,
but no later than noon February 14, 1994, to the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, room 5415, 400 Seventh
Street SW., Washington, DC 20590 or by fax to (202) 366&hyph;7256. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to assure the orderly presentation of information, and to try to accommodate all speakers, each person wishing
to present information at the meeting, whether in a personal or a representative capacity on behalf of an organization,
will be allotted five minutes. Persons who wish to present information at the meeting should notify OCST no later than
February 8, 1994, to reserve their allotted time. If possible, OCST will notify interested persons if additional
time is available. Department officials chairing the meeting may take additional time to ask clarifying questions
of the speaker. To reserve speaking time, please telephone (202) 366&hyph;5770. Additional information may be obtained
by contacting Ms. Linda H. Strine.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA as lead agency, in cooperation with the South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) as joint lead agency
will prepare an Environmental Assessment intended to assess the environmental impacts related to various alternatives
for development at the Atlantic City International Airport. The Atlantic City International Airport consists of
a total of 5,143 acres; 5,059 acres of property termed the ``FAA Technical Center'' which includes the Federal Aviation
Administration and Air National Guard (ANG) facilities owned by the FAA, and 84 acres owned by the South Jersey Transportation
Authority which is used to accommodate the Atlantic City International Airport Civil Terminal area. The 84 acre Atlantic
City International Airport Civil Terminal Area is independent of the 5,059 acre site. The Atlantic City International
Airport is located in portions of Hamilton, Egg Harbor and Galloway Townships in Atlantic County, New Jersey. The
Atlantic City International Airport is approximately 10 miles northeast of Atlantic City.

 The Secretaries of Education and Labor announce an absolute priority for awards to be made in fiscal year 1994 to enable
States to implement plans for statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems. These systems would offer young
Americans access to programs designed to prepare them for a first job in high-skill, high-wage careers, and to increase
their opportunities for further education. The Secretaries also announce selection criteria that will be applied
in evaluating applications submitted for this competition.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Departments of Education and Labor have entered into a partnership to establish a national framework within which
all States can create statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems. These systems will help our youth acquire
the knowledge, skills, abilities, and labor market information they need to make a smooth and effective transition
from school to career-oriented work or to further education or training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, three-fourths of America's high school students enter the workforce without baccalaureate degrees.
Many of them do not possess the basic academic and entry-level occupational skills necessary to succeed in the changing
workplace. Unemployment among American youth is intolerably high, and earnings of high school graduates have been
falling relative to those with more education. In addition, the American workplace is changing in response to heightened
international competition and new technologies, and these forces, which are ultimately beneficial to the Nation,
are shrinking the demand for and undermining the earning power of unskilled labor. The School-to-Work Opportunities
initiative is the result of a broad-based and growing interest in creating school-to-work transition systems in
which young Americans choose and navigate paths to productive and progressively more rewarding roles in the workplace.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative and the fiscal year 1994 Cooperative Demonstration Program
competition, Federal funds will be used as ``venture capital'' to stimulate State and local creativity in establishing
statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems. To achieve this systemic reform, States may choose to build on
and enrich current promising programs such as tech-prep education, career academies, school-to-apprenticeship,
cooperative education, youth apprenticeship, and business-education compacts, that can be developed into programs
under a School-to-Work Opportunities system. Through the formation of partnerships among secondary and postsecondary
educational institutions, private and public employers, labor organizations, government, community groups,
parents, and other key groups, communities will take ownership and responsibility for giving American youth access
to skills and employment opportunities that will launch them on paths leading to high-skill, high-wage careers.
Together, States and localities will take the lead in determining goals and priorities, developing new strategies,
and measuring progress.

The Federal role in the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is important, but limited to the establishment
of broad national criteria and a framework within which States create School-to-Work Opportunities systems. The
Federal role is to (a) invest in State and local initiatives by providing seed capital; (b) help States and localities
learn from each other and from the experience of our international competitors; (c) build a knowledge base of effective
school-to-work models, including strategies that meet the needs of disadvantaged youth and that can be implemented
successfully in poor communities; and (d) create a national framework through common core criteria and national
standards.

The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative provides for a substantial degree of State flexibility and experimentation,
but all State systems will share the following common features and basic program components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis of a School-to-Work Opportunities system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the integration of work-based and school-based learning that provides students, to the extent practicable,
with broad instruction on all aspects of the industry students are preparing to enter, (2) the integration of occupational
and academic learning, and (3) the linking of secondary and postsecondary education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To build bridges from school-to-work, programs must provide students with an integrated array of learning experiences
in the classroom and at the worksite. In order to ensure that students receive these learning experiences, all School-to-Work
Opportunities programs must incorporate three basic program components: Work-based learning, school-based learning,
and connecting activities. These three core components include_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Work-based learning that includes providing students with a planned program of job training and experiences
relevant to a student's career and leading to the award of a skill certificate, paid work experience, workplace mentoring,
and instruction in general workplace competencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;School-based learning that includes career awareness and career exploration and counseling, initial selection
of a career major by interested students not later than the beginning of the 11th grade, a coherent multi-year sequence
of instruction typically beginning no later than the eleventh grade and ending typically after at least one year of
postsecondary education tied to high academic and skill standards, which would be developed under the proposed ``Goals
2000: Educate America Act,'' and regularly scheduled evaluations to identify students' academic strengths and
weaknesses, academic progress, workplace knowledge, and goals; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Connecting activities to ensure coordination between the work-based and school-based learning components
of each School-to-Work Opportunities program, which includes matching students with employers' work-based learning
opportunities, serving as a liaison among employer, school, teacher, parent, and student participants, providing
technical assistance to employers and others in designing work-based learning components, providing assistance
to students who have completed the program in finding appropriate employment, continuing their education, or obtaining
additional training, collecting information regarding the outcome of students' participation in the School-to-Work
Opportunities program, and linking youth development activities under the School-to-Work Opportunities program
with employers' strategies for upgrading the skills of their workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
School-to-Work Opportunities programs will result in students attaining: (1) A high school diploma or its equivalent,
(2) a certificate or diploma recognizing successful completion of one or two years of postsecondary education, if
appropriate, and (3) a skill certificate. In addition, these students will be ready to begin a first job on a career
track and pursue further education and training.

The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is proceeding on two funding tracks_(1) during fiscal year 1994, the
initiative is being funded under current legislative authority in the Job Training Partnership Act and the Carl D.
Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins Act); and (2) for fiscal years 1995 through 2002,
the Departments plan to fund the initiative under the proposed ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1993,'' which
was introduced in Congress on August 5, 1993 as H.R. 2884 and S.1361. The funds will be made available through a grants
program. The Department of Education and the Department of Labor are jointly designing and providing for the administration
of a State grants program, that consists of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Development Grants, that are currently being awarded to each State for developing a statewide School-to-Work
Opportunities plan; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Implementation Grants, as described in this notice, awarded competitively to States that can demonstrate substantial
ability to begin full-scale operations and implement the statewide plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretaries have reserved approximately $250,000 in fiscal year 1994 funds appropriated under the Job Training
Partnership Act, to assist the Territories in developing and implementing School-to-Work Opportunities systems.
Specific information regarding the availability of these funds will be announced at a later date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The efforts that take place under both current authority and the proposed legislation are built on a phased-in approach
that allows States to ``come on line'' at different points in time, depending on each State's readiness to undertake
broad-scale change and on the availability of funds. Development Grants financed from funds requested by the Department
of Labor under the Job Training Partnership Act began to be awarded to States during December, 1993 and are continuing
to be awarded in January, 1994 to permit States to begin or enhance planning and developmental efforts to create comprehensive
statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each Development Grant discussed above is being awarded for a nine-month period. The Secretaries may make additional
Development Grants available subsequent to that period to States that do not receive an Implementation Grant under
this competition, if those States demonstrate substantial progress towards developing a comprehensive statewide
School-to-Work Opportunities plan and if they demonstrate that Federal funds will be used effectively.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By this notice, the Secretaries are reserving a portion of the funds appropriated under the Perkins Act in fiscal year
1994 for grants to States to implement statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems based on State plans. The
Secretaries are also establishing selection criteria to be applied in evaluating applications for those funds.
The Secretaries are limiting eligibility for implementation grants to States because the Secretaries have concluded
that, for this competition, the purposes of 34 CFR 426.4(b)(2) can best be achieved by awarding grants only to State
level applicants. Implementation Grants will be funded for up to a five-year period. The Secretaries anticipate
that continuation awards will be funded under the School-to-Work Opportunities legislation, once it is enacted.
Although there may be certain differences between requirements under the legislation as eventually enacted and
grant requirements under this notice, the Secretaries do not expect these to be fundamental. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantees under this competition will be required to fund local partnerships to carry out activities under the School-to-Work
Opportunities program. The Secretaries intend grantees to fund local partnerships through subgrants, as authorized
by the fiscal year 1994 Department of Education Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;112).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the Secretaries' invitation in the notice of proposed priority, 27 parties submitted comments. An

Changes in the Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In responding to comments received and in developing the final notice, the Secretaries have considered the persuasiveness
of the numerous suggestions made by the various commenters. The Secretaries have also considered the House and Senate
School-to-Work Opportunities bills currently being considered by Congress. The Secretaries have made some of the
changes suggested by commenters because the Secretaries concluded that these changes served to further the purposes
of the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative. In addition, in the interest of facilitating grantees' transition
from funding under the Cooperative Demonstration authority to funding under the anticipated School-to-Work Opportunities
legislation, the Secretaries have also made changes that are consistent with the Cooperative Demonstration authority
in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, and, where possible, with the House and Senate
bills. Ultimately, although there may be certain differences between the legislation as enacted and the notice,
the Secretaries do not expect these to be fundamental. To the extent that any differences exist, the Secretaries plan
to provide grantees with appropriate technical assistance and support in the transition from funding under the Cooperative
Demonstration authority to systems funding under the anticipated School-to-Work Opportunities legislation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the notice since publication of the proposed priority and selection
criteria is published as an appendix to this notice. The following changes made to the notice are described in the order
that they appear in the notice; technical and other minor changes are not addressed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``All students''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Reference to ``students who have dropped out of school'' has been added to the definition of the term ``All students''
to clarify that drop-out youth are included within the term and that, therefore, drop-out youth are intended to be
served under the School-to-Work Opportunities program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``All aspects of the industry''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``Elements of an industry'' has been replaced by the term ``All aspects of the industry'' for the purpose of
achieving consistency with the proposed School-to-Work Opportunities legislation, as well as with the Carl D. Perkins
Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, both of which utilize the term ``all aspects of the industry.''
In defining the term, the Secretaries have chosen to apply the definition contained in 34 CFR 400.4(b) of the regulations
implementing the Perkins Act. The use of the term ``All aspects of the industry'' rather than ``Elements of the industry''
is not intended to affect a change upon this competition or upon the requirements contained in the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Career major''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (d) of the definition of ``Career major'' has been revised to indicate that a student participating in a
School-to-Work Opportunities program may satisfy the requirement for a high school diploma by earning the ``equivalent''
of a high school diploma. The determination of what is the ``equivalent'' of a high school diploma is left to each State.
Paragraph (e) of the definition of ``Career major'' has been revised by adding the clause ``or admission into a degree
granting college or university.'' This change is meant to clarify that admission into a degree-granting college
or university is one example of the further education and training to which a career major may lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Partnership''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition of the term ``Partnership'' has been revised by adding the words ``non-managerial'' before the word
``employee''. The intent is to clarify what type of employee is being referred to in the reference to ``labor organizations
or employee representatives.'' The Secretaries consider it likely that managerial employees will be represented
within the category of ``employers.'' In addition, the definition of ``Partnership'' has been revised to include
within the illustrative list of ``other entities'' that may be included in a partnership national trade associations
working at the local level; proprietary institutions of higher education, as defined in section 481(b) of the Higher
Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1088(b)), which continue to meet the eligibility and certification requirements
under section 498 of such Act; and vocational student organizations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Skill certificate''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition of the term ``Skill certificate'' has been revised to clarify that the term is intended to refer to a
portable, industry-recognized credential, that certifies that a student has mastered skills that are benchmarked
to high-quality standards. In addition, under the revised definition, prior to the development of skill standards
under the proposed Goals 2000: Educate America Act, States are required to develop skill standards under a process
described in their plan. Those standards also must be benchmarked to high-quality standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Workplace mentor''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition of the term ``Workplace mentor'' has been revised to clarify that a workplace mentor may be either an
employee at the workplace in which work-based learning is being provided, or another individual approved by the employer.
This revision makes clear that individuals such as special educators, vocational rehabilitation counselors, job
coaches, and work-study coordinators, may serve as workplace mentors for all students, including, in particular,
students with disabilities. In addition, the definition has been revised to require workplace mentors to possess
both the skills and knowledge to be mastered by the student whom they are mentoring in the workplace.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Collaboration with appropriate officials (Paragraph (b)(2)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The priority has been revised to require collaboration with the State educational agency rather than the chief State
school officer in the implementation of School-to-Work Opportunities systems. The Secretaries have made this change
in order to be consistent with both the House and Senate bills. A corresponding change has been made to paragraph (b)(1)
of the selection criterion ``Collaboration and Involvement by Key Partners.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Active and continued involvement of interested parties (paragraph (b)(3)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The priority has been revised to include a reference to ``related services personnel'' following the reference to
teachers, in the illustrative list of interested parties whose active and continued involvement in States' School-to-Work
Opportunities systems may be obtained by States. In addition, in the interest of consistency with the proposed School-to-Work
Opportunities legislation that is expected to govern future funding of State School-to-Work Opportunities systems
and in response to comments, the Secretaries have added human services agencies, language minority communities,
Private Industry Councils established under the Job Training Partnership Act, vocational student organizations,
and State or regional cooperative education associations, to the illustrative list of interested parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Coordination of the use of funds (paragraph (b)(4)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The priority has been revised to include the Job Opportunities Basic Skills Training Program, authorized under part
F, title IV, of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 681 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

), programs of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and programs of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), among the related Federal programs with which States are directed to coordinate their School-to-Work Opportunities
systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State training strategies (new paragraph (b)(5)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The priority has been revised to include a new paragraph (b)(5) requiring that States describe their strategies for
providing training for teachers, employers, mentors, counselors, and other parties in the States' School-to-Work
Opportunities systems. The Secretaries view this change as being consistent with the intent of the School-to-Work
Opportunities initiative which calls for innovation and fundamental change in States' secondary school academic
and skill training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ensuring opportunities for young women to participate (paragraph (b)(8)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The priority has been revised so that, rather than being required simply to describe how States will ensure opportunities
for young women to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs, States are required to describe the goals
and the methods that they will use, such as awareness and outreach, to ensure opportunities for young women to participate
in School-to-Work Opportunities programs in a manner that leads to employment in high-performance, high-paying
jobs in non-traditional employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ensuring opportunities leading to employment (paragraph (b)(9)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The priority has been revised to clarify that States must describe how they will ensure opportunities for low-achieving
students, students with disabilities, and drop-outs, to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs
in a manner that leads to employment in high-performance, high-paying jobs. This revision renders paragraph (b)(9)
consistent with paragraph (b)(8), under which States must describe how they will ensure similar opportunities for
young women to participate.

Service to areas with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth (paragraph (b)(13)). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The priority has been revised to require States to describe: (1) How their systems will be expanded over time to cover
all geographic areas and (2) how proposed School-to-Work Opportunities systems will address the needs of students
from all communities, including areas with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth. (A parallel change
has been made to the ``Comprehensive Statewide System'' selection criterion.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General Program Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Basic Program Components. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``General Program Requirements'' section, containing the basic components of the School-to-Work Opportunities
program, has been revised to indicate that the high school diploma requirement may be satisfied when a student is awarded
the ``equivalent'' of a high school diploma, as determined under standards developed by the State. (Parallel changes
have been made to the definition of the term ``career major'' and to paragraph (e) of the ``Local Programs'' criterion.)
In addition, paragraph (a)(1) of the ``General Program Requirements'' section of the priority has been revised to
provide that one of the bases of a School-to-Work Opportunities system is the integration of work-based learning
and school-based learning ``that provides participating students, to the extent practicable, with broad instruction
in all aspects of the industry the students are preparing to enter.'' (As previously noted, a definition of the term
``all aspects of the industry'' has been provided in the ``Definitions'' section of this notice.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Work-based Learning. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reference to ``Broad instruction in a variety of elements of an industry'' has been deleted from the work-based
learning component of the ``General Program Requirements'' section, since reference to broad instruction in all
aspects of the industry that students are preparing to enter is now made in paragraph (a)(1) of the basic components
section of the priority. (See discussion above in paragraph (c)(1) of this summary). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
School-based Learning. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The school-based learning component has been revised to require, among other stated elements, ``career awareness
and career exploration and counseling (beginning at the earliest possible age)'' in order to help interested students
to identify, select, or reconsider, their interests, goals, and career majors, ``including those options that may
not be traditional for their gender, race, or ethnicity.'' This change makes clear that promotion of career awareness
and exploration of all career options, at an early age, is desirable. The determination of the age at which career awareness,
career exploration, and counseling should appropriately begin, is left to the States. And, the section of the school-based
learning component containing the requirement for regularly scheduled evaluations has been revised to require

The connecting activities component has been revised to include, among other required elements, ``Providing assistance
to schools and employers to integrate school-based and work-based learning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and integrate academic and occupational learning.'' In addition, the Secretaries have revised this component to
provide an illustrative list of post program outcome information that grantees may include among the types of information
they collect. The list includes information on gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic background, limited-English

Reference to ``related services personnel'' has been added to the list of those individuals in paragraph (c) for whom
training could be provided by a grantee under this priority. In addition, the outreach activities in paragraph (b)
have been revised to include the clause ``stimulating the development of partnerships in poor communities.'' And,
paragraph (h) has been added to provide that States may work with ``localities to recruit and retain all students in
School-to-Work Opportunities programs, including those from a broad range of backgrounds and circumstances.''

Allocation of Funds to Local Partnerships. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the notice of proposed priority was published, the Departments did not have the authority to require States to
award subgrants to local partnerships with funds awarded under this competition. The 1994 Department of Education
Appropriation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;112), included a provision authorizing grantees of funds under this competition
to make subgrants to localities for carrying out School-to-Work Opportunities projects. In light of this new authority,
the notice has been modified so that it now requires States receiving School-to-Work Opportunities Implementation
grants under this competition to distribute to local partnerships 65 percent of the amounts they receive, as subgrants
to localities. Under the pending legislation, we expect that this amount will increase to 75 percent in the second
year, and 85 percent in each year thereafter.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Examples of Activities for Local Partnerships. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New paragraphs (f), (l), (m), and (n) have been added so that included among allowable activities for local partnerships
are: providing career exploration and awareness services, counseling and mentoring services, college awareness,
and other services to prepare students for the transition from school to work; designing local strategies to provide
adequate planning time and staff development activities for teachers, school counselors, and related services
personnel; enhancing linkages between after school, weekend, and summer jobs, and opportunities for career exploration
and school-based learning; and conducting outreach to all students in a manner that most appropriately meets their
needs and the needs of their communities. Redesignated paragraph (g) has been changed to specifically include disabled
students in graduation assistance programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Safeguards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A reference to labor standards has been added to paragraph (d) under ``Safeguards,'' to clarify that all existing
labor standards must be applied to School-to-Work Opportunities systems funded under this competition. Under paragraph
(d) as revised, States are required to provide all students with adequate and safe equipment and a safe and healthful
workplace in conformity with all health, safety, and labor standards of Federal, State, and local law.

Selection Criteria for Evaluating Applications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the discussion of the application review process, the Secretaries have clarified that, among the factors upon
which the Secretaries will base their funding decisions are the replicability, sustainability, and innovation
of the School-to-Work Opportunities plans described in the States' applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comprehensive Statewide System. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the ``Comprehensive Statewide System'' criterion, the Secretaries have made a revision to clarify that each State
must propose a feasible plan for expanding the School-to-Work Opportunities system so that students in all parts
of the State, including communities with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth, will have the opportunity
to participate in the State's School-to-Work Opportunities program within a reasonable period of time. This criterion
is intended to ensure that State skill standards and methods of skill assessment are benchmarked to high quality standards
and that students receiving skill certificates under the School-to-Work Opportunities program will have the opportunity
to enter high-skill, high-wage, employment. Accordingly, the question ``Does the State's process for assessing
skills reflect the needs of high performance workplaces as well as meet the requirements of broad clusters of related
occupations and industries, rather than those of individual jobs or occupations?'' has been added to this criterion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Involvement by Key Parties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this criterion, States will be evaluated on whether they propose effective and convincing strategies for obtaining
the active and continued involvement in the School-to-Work Opportunities program of employers and other interested
parties within the State. The criterion has been revised to reflect the Secretaries' intent that each State obtain
input, from employers and other key parties, on the State's plans for a proposed School-to-Work Opportunities system,
prior to submitting an application for funds under this competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Resources. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Resources'' selection criterion has been revised to include the question: ``Does the applicant limit administrative
costs in order to maximize the amounts spent on delivery of services to students enrolled in School-to-Work Opportunities
programs?'' Accordingly, applications will be reviewed to ascertain, among other things, whether States are planning
to limit State and local partnership administrative costs in order to direct as large a portion of the funds received
as possible toward providing academic and training services to students participating in their School-to-Work
Opportunities programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Student Participation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Student Participation'' selection criterion has been revised to include ``students with limited-English
proficiency and academically talented students.'' The intent is to be consistent with the definition of the term
``All students'' (and to further clarify that School-to-Work Opportunities systems are intended to meet the needs
of academically talented students).

Safeguards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretaries apply the following safeguards to School-to-Work Opportunities programs funded under this priority:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) No student shall displace any currently employed worker (including a partial displacement, such as a reduction
in the hours of non-overtime work, wages, or employment benefits). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) No School-to-Work Opportunities program shall impair existing contracts for services or collective bargaining
agreements, except that no program under this priority that would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement shall be undertaken without the written concurrence of the labor organization and employer concerned.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) No student shall be employed or job opening filled_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When any other individual is on temporary layoff from the participating employer, with the clear possibility
of recall, from the same or any substantially equivalent job; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the employer has terminated the employment of any regular employee or otherwise reduced its workforce with
the intention of filling the vacancy so created with a student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Students shall be provided with adequate and safe equipment and a safe and healthful workplace in conformity with
all health, safety, and labor standards of Federal, State, and local law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Nothing in this priority shall be construed so as to modify or affect any Federal or State law prohibiting discrimination
on the basis of race, religion, color, ethnicity, national origin, gender, age, or disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Funds awarded under this priority shall not be expended for wages of students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The grantee shall implement and maintain such other safeguards as the Secretaries may deem appropriate in order
to ensure that School-to-Work Opportunities participants are afforded adequate supervision by skilled adult workers,
or, otherwise, to further the purposes of this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant must provide an assurance, in the application, that the foregoing safeguards will be implemented and
maintained throughout all program activities.

Selection Criteria for Evaluating Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the School-to-Work Opportunities Implementation Grant competition, the Secretaries will use the following
selection criteria in evaluating applications. The Secretaries will evaluate applications using a two-phase review
process. In the first phase of the review process, the Secretaries will use peer reviewers to evaluate applications
using the selection criteria and the associated point values. In the second phase, review teams will visit high-ranking
States to gain further information and further assess State plans. The second-phase review teams will use the criteria,
but not necessarily the associated point values, in their information-gathering and assessment activities. Final
funding decisions made by the Secretaries will be based on information gained during the site visits, the ranking
of applications during the first-phase review, and such other factors as geographic balance and diversity of program
approaches, replicability, sustainability, and innovation.

Comprehensive Statewide System.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (25 points) Is the School-to-Work Opportunities plan described in the application likely to produce systemic statewide
change that will have substantial impact on the preparation of youth for a first job in a high-skill, high-wage career
and in increasing their opportunities for further education? Does the plan provide information reflecting the needs
of each local labor market area in the designated geographic areas of the State? Does the State propose a feasible plan
for expanding the system to ensure that all geographic areas of the State, including communities with high concentrations
of poor and disadvantaged youth, will have an opportunity to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs
within a reasonable period of time? Is the process for assessing skills and issuing skill certificates likely to lead
to portable credentials for students and are the skills adequately benchmarked to high quality standards such as
those envisioned in the Goals 2000: Educate America Act? Does the State's process for assessing skills reflect the
needs of high performance workplaces and meet the requirements of broad clusters of related occupations and industries,
rather than those of individual jobs or occupations? Has the State described State and local performance standards
that should lead to statewide systemic reform of secondary education?

barriers to statewide implementation and include a system for addressing them as they arise? Does the management
plan include a process for incorporating methods to improve or redesign the implementation system based on program
outcomes, for example through an evaluation plan? Will the State's performance standards be applied to local partnerships
and will the standards be used to evaluate and improve their outcomes? Are key personnel under the plan qualified to
perform the required activities, particularly to maintain the essential partnerships at the State level in a manner
sufficient to implement the plan? Will Federal funds under the School-to-Work Opportunities Program grant be used

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter noted that Congress is currently debating the exact requirements for programs under the proposed School-to-Work
Opportunities bill and expressed the belief that States are not immediately prepared to implement Statewide plans
and systems. The commenter suggested that it would be preferable to extend the comment period for this notice until
after Congress has agreed to the statutory program requirements. The commenter suggested that if the Departments
choose to award implementation grants prior to the enactment of School-to-Work Opportunities legislation, they
would have the authority to include provisions not contained in the original Administration bill nor, indeed, in
the House or the Senate versions, so long as these provisions are consistent with the broad provisions for the Cooperative
Demonstration Program authorized under section 420A of the Perkins Act, and 34 CFR 426.4, under which the funds for
this competition were appropriated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretaries do not agree that the comment period should be extended until the School-to-Work Opportunities bill
is enacted into law by Congress. Indicative of Congressional intent to allow States and localities to begin establishing
School-to-Work Opportunities systems, Congress has appropriated funds under existing authority for this fiscal
year 1994 competition. The Secretaries wish to award grants as soon as possible after July 1, 1994, when the funds become
available, so that the States that compete successfully for those funds may have School-to-Work Opportunities systems
operating in the 1994&hyph;95 school year. Waiting until enactment to publish a notice inviting applications would
inevitably result in significant delays in both awarding funds and initiating programs and activities. At the same
time, however, the Secretaries want to make certain that, to the greatest extent practicable, this priority reflects
the most current Congressional action to date on the pending legislation. Accordingly, where provisions of the House
and Senate bills are identical and differ from the provisions in the proposed notice, and where the House and Senate
modifications are consistent with relevant existing authorities, the Secretaries have reflected those modifications
in this final notice.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that, because the Federal Government already carries out the function of career education through
the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee, the Secretaries should add a fourth Federal role
to the three already delineated in the ``Background'' section of the notice, ``to assist States in the provision of
accurate and timely occupational and career development information for purposes of program planning, career guidance
and counseling, and individual career exploration, choice and educational planning.''

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal role that is delineated in the ``Background'' section of the October 14, 1993 notice is a broad characterization
of the Federal role envisioned by the Secretaries. The ``Background'' section is not meant to delineate each of the
ways in which the Federal Government might assist States or localities to implement school-to-work systems. Counseling
and integrating existing Federal, State, and local programs into comprehensive School-to-Work Opportunities
systems is clearly of vital importance to the national School-to-Work Opportunities framework and are embodied
in the criteria in this notice as well as in the pending legislation. Although it is not the Secretaries' intent to recount
all possible Federal roles here, the Secretaries have added reference to a fourth Federal role, that of creating a
national School-to-Work Opportunities framework through common core criteria and national standards. The Secretaries
believe that the Federal role referred to by the commenter is implicit in this notice.

Comment:

 The competition covered by this notice is for State grants only. From grants received under this competition, grantees
will distribute a substantial amount of funds to localities, including high poverty areas. Each State must demonstrate
in its plan how it will ensure opportunities for ``all students'' to participate in the program. In addition, each
State will be required to describe how its School-to-Work Opportunities system will be expanded to cover all geographic
areas, including high poverty areas. The Departments will soon announce a separate direct grant program for local
projects located in high poverty areas.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed that it was unclear from the notice whether there are clear vehicles for the Federal Government
to help States and localities learn from each other and from the experience of international competitors, and to build
a knowledge base of effective school-to-work models. Therefore, the commenter suggested that the notice be modified
to include a separate grant program or a contract to support the Federal Government in achieving these roles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice relates only to the School-to-Work Opportunities State grants competition. However, other funds will
be available under the fiscal year 1994 appropriation for Federal level activities, such as technical assistance

The Secretaries do not envision one separate grant or contract for achieving these purposes, but plan to utilize the
broad range of vehicles available to them.

the partnerships anticipated, and suggested awarding a separate seed grant to a local body not politically tied to
any one of the stakeholders for this purpose.

 The Secretaries believe that States and local communities can best determine how to form and govern the partnerships
required under this program. A local partnership can determine for itself which entity in that community is best equipped
to manage the partnership. Thus, the Secretaries see no need for the separate direct Federal grants recommended by
the commenter.

 One commenter noted that certificates and credentials in the United States are linked to limited, very defined jobs,
such as ``radiology,'' and not to sets of skills that integrate knowledge across an industry. The commenter suggested
that the States will need to overhaul their current approach to certification and credentialing if this definition
is to be realized.

 It is the Secretaries' intent that States design School-to-Work Opportunities programs of high quality that will
prepare students to become part of a high-performance workforce and that will lead to skill certificates as one of
the outcomes of participation. Until there is a system of national skill standards, States are encouraged to apply
the highest standards and certifications available. During this period, the Departments will be assisting States
in identifying sources and means by which to access existing high quality, industry-recognized standards and accompanying
assessment tools, as well as assisting States to collaborate effectively with each other toward the development
of high quality skill standards. Once the National Skill Standards Board begins its work, and even before there are
skill standards actually endorsed by the Board, States will be required to take the work of the Board into consideration
in their development of standards for skill certificates, as is likely to be required under the proposed School-to-Work
Opportunities legislation. This is intended to facilitate the development of national, portable credentials and
to avoid unnecessary duplication and overlap.

the view that if ``all students'' are intended to be successful in the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative,
the notice should require or acknowledge the need for considerably more effort and resources to be devoted to female
students and to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Another commenter felt that the notice should include
language emphasizing inclusive projects, that is, that the school-to-work needs of all students should be addressed,
not simply the needs of mainstream children without special needs.

 The definition of the term ``All students'' in this notice includes a number of population groups with special needs.
Among these are disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, students with limited-English proficiency,
and former students who have dropped out of school. Moreover, under the ``Student Participation'' selection criterion,
reviewers will assess the extent to which States propose realistic strategies and programs to demonstrate that ``all
students,'' including young women, minorities, and low achieving students, have the opportunity to participate
in the State's School-to-Work Opportunities program. The notice also requires that State plans address how States
will provide opportunities for all students to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs. The Secretaries
agree, however, that an additional question in the selection criteria would help evaluators assess the extent to
which States have also addressed the needs of students from communities with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged
youth. Similarly, the Secretaries have concluded that the priority should include a specific reference to communities
with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth. Thus, the Secretaries have revised the notice to require
States to indicate specifically in their plans how all students, including women, minorities, low achieving students,
and students from communities with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth, will have an opportunity
to participate in each State's proposed School-to-Work Opportunities program. The Secretaries have also revised
the selection criterion to consider whether States propose feasible plans to include communities with high concentrations
of poor and disadvantaged youth in the system.

 The School-to-Work Opportunities program is not intended to be limited to only certain categories of students. The
definition of ``all students'' specifically includes students from a broad range of backgrounds and circumstances,
including academically talented students. The notice establishes that career majors would typically include two
years of secondary school as well as one or two years of postsecondary education. And, as part of their participation
in a School-to-Work Opportunities program, students who are completing their first or second years at the postsecondary
level would be prepared to take advantage of options in employment and education, including enrollment in a college
or university bestowing a four-year degree. However, the Secretaries agree with the commenter that the definition
should be revised to clarify that admission into such a college or university is just one of the options available to
participating students to which a career major may lead.

 Two commenters raised questions relative to the definition of ``Elements of the industry,'' as used in the proposed

the kind of thorough and challenging understanding of all aspects of an industry that are necessary for the School-to-Work
Opportunities initiative to be successful in transforming the future American labor force. Instead, the commenter
stated a preference for the language in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act that requires
students to be provided with an understanding of ``all aspects of an industry.'' The second commenter believed that
the term ``industry'' would be poorly understood and that the term should be defined as a collection of employers who
share common requirements for human and physical capital, such as the aerospace industry, etc.

One commenter stated that, while a four-year degree is not the primary focus or goal of the School-to-Work Opportunities

program. The commenter felt that course work should be sufficiently rigorous and linked to higher education academic
requirements so a student could enter into a four-year academic program following participation in the program.
This commenter suggested that the term, ``or enrollment in a Bachelor's degree program'' be added to the end of the

One commenter stated that the proposed definition of a ``career major'' included criteria that would result in an
automatic barrier preventing many students with disabilities from benefitting from a School-to-Work Opportunities
program. This commenter felt that, in most school systems, students participating in special education programs
continue to receive certificates in lieu of a high school diploma and that one or two additional years of training past
high school should be an acceptable outcome for many of these learners in lieu of one or two years of postsecondary education.
The commenter recommended that the definition of the term ``career major'' be revised in specific ways to accommodate
and encourage the participation of special education students.

equivalent diplomas or certificates to disabled students. Accordingly, the Secretaries intend to include within
the term ``equivalent,'' which has been added to the definition of the term ``Career major,'' certificates provided
by States to students with disabilities, that are considered to be equivalent to high school diplomas.

One commenter felt that two years of secondary school and one or two years of post-secondary education would be too
great a time commitment for many disadvantaged youth, particularly dropout youth. In the opinion of the commenter,
disadvantaged youth with children or disadvantaged youth supporting themselves financially, necessarily require
a faster route to employment. Accordingly, the commenter suggested that ``one plus one,'' or a condensed one year
program, would better serve their needs.

The Secretaries believe that directing disadvantaged youth to abbreviated versions of the high quality programs
being provided to all other students would serve only to short-change the disadvantaged students since abbreviated
programs would fail to provide participants with the qualifications needed to obtain high-skill, high-wage employment.
A high school diploma and, often, one or two years of further education or training are required for students to obtain
the kinds of high-skill, high-wage employment envisioned by the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative. It is
important to note also that paid work experience_which is a basic program requirement of the School-to-Work Opportunities
program's work-based learning component_can also serve to provide some amount of income to participating disadvantaged
students. The students are also eligible for additional services under other programs such as the Job Training Partnership
Act. Moreover, under this program, States and local partnerships retain the flexibility to develop innovative supportive
services for disadvantaged students participating in School-to-Work Opportunities programs geared toward further
assisting them to meet their financial and other needs.

Four commenters believed that the participation of community-based organizations (CBOs) should be required in
program planning, implementation, and evaluation and, that to accomplish this, the term ``Partnership'' should
be redefined to ensure that CBOs are not left out due to a definition that appears to make their involvement optional.
A fifth commenter recommended that the definition of ``Partnership'' be modified to require the participation of
``teachers and related services personnel'' as a part of each partnership. The commenter believed that this was necessary
to encourage the participation of certain individuals (including rehabilitation counselors, school counselors,
psychologists, speech and language pathologists, audiologists, and social workers), who the commenter believes
are necessary to the successful participation of students with disabilities in the School-to-Work Opportunities
program.

The Secretaries agree with the commenters that CBOs will make important contributions to program planning, implementation,
and evaluation of School-to-Work Opportunities programs and encourage partnerships to include them. Indeed, the
Secretaries believe that most localities will choose to include CBOs because of the value that they are likely to bring
to local partnerships. The Secretaries also believe that teachers and related services personnel are likely to be
helpful as members of partnerships, and encourage localities to include them to the extent possible. However, the
Secretaries are opposed to requiring the participation in all partnerships of either CBOs or teachers and related
services personnel, and continue to believe that localities should be allowed to determine the membership in partnerships
of entities or groups outside of those whose membership is specifically mandated through the notice's definition
of the term ``Partnership.''

 One commenter believed that the definition of the term ``Skill certificate'' would impose a barrier for students
with disabilities and would encourage their exclusion from States' School-to-Work Opportunities programs. The
commenter suggested that the definition be changed to read, ``a portable, industry-recognized credential issued
by a program that certifies that a student has mastered skills at levels that, to the extent feasible, are at least as
challenging as the standards endorsed by the National Skill Standards Board.''

 As provided for in paragraph (b)(8) of the priority, under the School-to-Work Opportunities program, States are
required to describe in their plans how they will ensure that students with disabilities will have opportunities
to participate in the States' School-to-Work Opportunities programs. Under the ``Student Participation'' selection
criterion, States are required to propose realistic strategies and programs to ensure that all students, including
students with disabilities, have opportunities to participate in their States' School-to-Work Opportunities
programs. The clause ``ensuring opportunities to participate'' is intended to include opportunities to achieve
program outcomes, including a skill certificate. While it is very important that individuals with disabilities
be provided with the necessary support to ensure that they have the opportunity to participate, the Secretaries do
not see the need to modify the definition of the term ``Skill certificate'' to provide for different skill levels for
students with disabilities, than those provided for students without disabilities.

 One commenter suggested that the workplace mentor was a critical link within the School-to-Work Opportunities program
and was likely to require special training in order to fulfill this role effectively. The commenter viewed the workplace
mentor as being a pedagogue with technical knowledge of the employment areas of interest to the students participating
in the program. The commenter felt that greater consideration should be given under this program to training of workplace
mentors and that this could best be achieved under a separate grant program.

 Under this priority, State and local partnerships may utilize implementation grant funds to train workplace mentors
to ensure that they are knowledgeable in the employment areas that School-to-Work Opportunities students are engaged
in and to ensure that the mentors have the necessary knowledge of the work-based curriculum as well as other program
policies and practices. Because the Secretaries believe that partnerships should be able to customize programs
to meet the needs of local communities, including those of employers and students, they do not believe that a separate
grant program is necessary to providing the proper training for workplace mentors.

 Two commenters suggested that the Secretaries consider awarding School-to-Work Opportunities grants on a priority
basis to: (1) Areas with high levels of unemployment, (2) areas that are impacted by military base closures, and (3)
areas that are experiencing cutbacks in defense spending or conversions from defense manufacturing. One of the commenters
also suggested that the Secretaries consider awarding grants under this competition based on priorities addressing
new and emerging technologies and displaying ``complete vertical integration from start to partnering and productive
employment placement.'' Similarly, the second commenter felt that priority should be extended to areas of economic
need that can greatly benefit from additional coordinated funding such as that available under the National and Community
Service Act. A third commenter felt that priority should be given to communities with high concentrations of poor
and disadvantaged youth.

 The purpose of this award is to provide funds to States to develop statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems.
The State plan must describe how the State will stimulate and support local School-to-Work Opportunities programs
and how the State system will be expanded over time to cover all geographic areas in the State including those with high
concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth. States must also distribute a significant portion of their grant
funds to local partnerships (65 percent in the first year, 75 percent in the second year, and 85 percent in the third
year.) Within this context, States and localities have the flexibility to determine those areas that should receive
priority in the establishment of statewide systems and for receipt of funds. While the Secretaries recognize the
value of directing School-to-Work Opportunities funds to all of the areas named by the commenters, the Secretaries
are opposed to mandating to States that these areas receive funds on a priority basis. Although they have not established
a priority for such communities, in response to the third commenter's concerns about communities with high concentrations
of poor and disadvantaged youth, the Secretaries have made a change.

 One commenter stated that making States responsible for School-to-Work Opportunities programs made sense for most
populations but not necessarily for migrant or seasonal farmworkers. The commenter felt that what he referred to
as ``State-run initiatives'' sometimes fail to include services for these populations since they are often considered
to be a national population. In the commenter's view, even where States are aware that farmworkers live within their
boundaries, States often do not have the special expertise needed to provide these populations with services, or
may not be able to serve the full range of the farmworker population. The commenter suggested that the Secretaries
encourage States to take the unique needs of farmworker youth into account as States develop their comprehensive
statewide School-to-Work Opportunities plans.

and seasonal farmworker youth into account in developing their plans.

With regard to SOICCs and State Employment Security Labor Market Information Units, the Secretaries agree that these

to determine what are the best sources of information for their specific needs, as well as the best methods of obtaining
information important to their programs. In response to the commenter's second point, the Secretaries note that,
in paragraph (b)(3) of the priority, States must describe their ``procedure for obtaining the active and continued
involvement in the statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system of *&blank;*&blank;* teachers, students, and
parents *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The Secretaries have concluded that it is preferable to allow each State the flexibility
to determine both the specific kinds of career development assistance that will be made available to students and
the specific manner in which parents and teachers will be included in the career development aspects of the School-to-Work
Opportunities program.

suggested that community colleges should have the opportunity to apply for grants under this program or to be designated
as fiscal agents. Further, the commenter suggested that, given the opportunity, community colleges could serve
effectively as centralized ``School-to-Work Program Centers'' and could develop consortium arrangements between
high schools and employers.

will award subgrants to local partnerships that must include employers, public secondary and postsecondary educational
institutions or agencies, and labor organizations or employee representatives. As public postsecondary educational
institutions, many community colleges will qualify to participate in partnerships. Community colleges are expected
to play an important and active role in School-to-Work Opportunities programs. The matter of which entity will serve
as grant recipient or fiscal agent at the State or local level will be decided by States and local partnerships.

One commenter believed that one goal of a School-to-Work Opportunities system is not only to prepare youth for existing
jobs but also to enable them to gain access to growing sectors of the economy likely to affect future markets. In the
view of the commenter, States should be encouraged to identify and incorporate into their plans those geographical
areas that are targeted for economic growth. The commenter further stated that these would include areas that are
either receiving Federal, State, or local funds, or receiving funds from all of these sources, for the purpose of stimulating
their economies, or areas that have been identified by local governmental or community based agencies for economic

 The Secretaries agree that the implementation of each State's School-to-Work Opportunities system must be a collaborative
effort involving numerous officials within the State. Systemic change and the provision of appropriate education,
training, and employment opportunities for all students cannot be achieved otherwise. However, beyond specifying
the involvement of the Governor, the State educational agency, the State agency officials responsible for job training
and employment, economic development, and postsecondary education as the priority does the Secretaries have opted
not to dictate to States which additional State officials must be included in this collaborative effort. The Secretaries
do, however, encourage the collaboration of those officials named by the commenter and, in fact, list ``rehabilitation
agencies and organizations'' among those entities which the State should actively involve in the implementation
of statewide systems.

commenters suggested that the Secretaries add specific references to the following additional interested parties:
Language minority communities, Private Industry Councils, related services personnel (such as vocational rehabilitation
counselors and job coaches) following the word ``teachers,'' and human services agencies. One commenter suggested
that teachers be moved to the top of the existing list of interested parties in order to indicate that priority will
be assigned to applications placing priority upon the cooperation of teachers. Two of the commenters were particularly
interested in ensuring the active and continued involvement of those parties that are most critical to the preparation
of disabled populations for work and that are essential to the success of disabled youth within the job setting.

 The Secretaries agree that the active and continued involvement of each of the parties named by the commenters would
be entirely appropriate under paragraph (b)(3) of the priority notice, and have revised paragraph (b)(3) accordingly.
Specifically, with regard to Private Industry Councils established under the Job Training Partnership Act and with
regard to vocational rehabilitation personnel, the Secretaries wish to point out that, in the definition of the term
``partnership,'' these have been specifically named by the Secretaries as parties that may be included within partnerships.
In addition to the parties suggested by the commenters, the House and Senate School-to-Work Opportunities bills
include vocational student organizations and State or regional cooperative education associations to the list
of other interested parties. The Secretaries have added vocational student organizations and State and regional
cooperative education associations to paragraph (b)(3) because the Secretaries consider these two entities to
be appropriate additions to the list of parties that may be involved in the State School-to-Work Opportunities system,
and to ease the transition from funding under this Notice to funding under anticipated School-to-Work Opportunities
legislation. In adding the parties suggested by the commenters and the parties in the House and Senate bills, the Secretaries
wish to emphasize that the list of other parties in paragraph (b)(3) is purely illustrative of the types of parties
whose active and continued participation in a State's School-to-Work system would be appropriate. Thus, while the
Secretaries will place an absolute priority upon applications that provide for the active and continued involvement
of employers and other interested parties, the Secretaries have chosen to allow each State the flexibility to determine
which parties in addition to employers would most effectively assist the State to implement its School-to-Work Opportunities
system.

 One commenter noted that the October 14, 1993 notice contained no mention of how comprehensive high schools would
be involved and served under the School-to-Work Opportunities State Implementation Grants program, suggesting
the need for clarification on the involvement of comprehensive high schools. The commenter was concerned that changes
were needed in order to ensure a viable role in the program not merely for vocational high schools but also for comprehensive
high schools and recommended that references to comprehensive high schools be added in paragraph (b)(3) of the priority
as well as in other parts of the notice where secondary schools are discussed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretaries fully intend that comprehensive high schools be included in each statewide School-to-Work Opportunities
system. In order to implement a comprehensive School-to-Work Opportunities system serving all students, States
must ensure opportunities for the participation of all students, including students in comprehensive high schools.
Under the School-to-Work Opportunities program and under this priority, it would be unacceptable for only vocational
high schools, for example, to be included in a State's implementation plan. However, the Secretaries believe that
specific reference to comprehensive high schools is unnecessary, since the term ``secondary'' encompasses all
schools at the secondary level.

 Under paragraph (b)(4) of the priority notice, each State is required to describe how its comprehensive School-to-Work
Opportunities system will coordinate the use of funds available from State and private sources with the use of funds
available from other Federal programs. One commenter suggested that a clause be added to paragraph (b)(4) requiring
the coordination of program activities funded with State and private sources with Federal program funds. The commenter
also recommended that the JOBS program be specifically listed.

 In response to the part of the comment suggesting that a specific reference be added to paragraph (b)(4) to ``program
activities'' supported with State or private funds, the Secretaries have concluded that such a reference is unnecessary.
The requirement in that paragraph is for coordination of the use of Federal education and training funds. Included
within the requirement articulated in paragraph (b)(4), is the requirement for coordination between the program
activities supported with the State and private funds and the program activities supported with funding received
under related Federal statutes. The Secretaries agree that the JOBS program should be specifically listed. However,
it is important to note that the list of Federal programs in paragraph (b)(4) is not an exhaustive list of related Federal
programs with which the use of State and private funds should be coordinated.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters stated that in paragraph (b)(9), which requires States to describe their processes for assessing
the skills and knowledge required in career majors and in awarding skills certificates that take into account the
work of the proposed National Skill Standards Board and the criteria established under the proposed Goals 2000: Educate
America Act, the priority ignores the fact that participation in Goals 2000 is voluntary. One commenter noted that
requiring students to receive a skill certificate, as a common feature of the program, assumes that the Goals 2000:
Educate America Act, which contains provisions for voluntary industry-based skill standards, will be enacted into
law. This commenter felt that it was inconsistent to require a skill certificate based on enactment of a law which establishes
only voluntary, industry-based, skill standards. Accordingly, the commenters suggested that language be added
to this paragraph of the priority notice, indicating that the standards or criteria developed under Goals 2000 will
only be required if the State is participating in Goals 2000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An important goal of the School-to-Work Opportunities program is to facilitate the employment of young Americans
in high-skill, high-wage occupations. Enhancing the ability of job applicants to demonstrate that they possess
high quality skills is one way to promote access to such employment. A skill certificate can provide that credential
and thereby enhance job prospects. Therefore, the Secretaries believe that this is a crucial component and should
be a required outcome. Participation in both the proposed Goals 2000 program and the School-to-Work Opportunities
program is entirely voluntary. However, should a State elect to participate, the Secretaries expect that skill certificates
will be awarded and that they will take into account the criteria proposed in Goals 2000 as well as the work of the National
Skills Standards Board. These criteria are intended to promote the highest quality and most internationally competitive
standards possible, in order to facilitate high-wage, high-skill employment.

One commenter supported the linking of skill certificates to the National Skill Standards Board and observed that
these standards should be the direct goal of each State's efforts, otherwise the skills standards would have little
use. This commenter believed that the standards should also be linked to the academic standards of the National Council
of Teachers of Math (NCTM) and the National Council of Teachers of Science (NCTS).

Several commenters requested that the Secretaries expand upon the requirement in paragraph (b)(6) of the October
14, 1993 notice (redesignated as (b)(7) of this notice), under which States must describe how they will ensure opportunities
for participation for all students. The commenters requested that this be done by requiring States to describe how
opportunities will be provided, particularly to low-achieving, disabled, and limited-English proficient students.
One commenter noted that paragraph (b)(8) of the October 14, 1993 notice should be redrafted in a manner similar to
paragraph (b)(7) of the October 14, 1993 notice, under which States were required to describe the manner in which opportunities
will be provided for young women to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs in a manner leading to meaningful
employment opportunities.

The Secretaries intend the requirement in paragraph (b)(8), redesignated as (b)(9) of this notice, relating to low-achieving
students, students with disabilities, and dropouts, to provide the same threshold for serving those students, as
the language in redesignated paragraph (b)(8) of the final priority, with regard to serving young women. In both paragraphs,
the Secretaries intend to seek descriptions from States as to how they will ensure opportunities for students to participate
in a meaningful and productive manner in the School-to-Work Opportunities program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While agreeing that all the items in the notice are critical, one commenter suggested that perhaps the most critical
item would be one requiring an agreement among ``stakeholders'' setting out the results to be achieved by each State's
program, how achievement of these results would be determined by stakeholders, and what agency would be entrusted
with the review of program results. The commenter suggested that an independent or quasi-independent entity would
be best suited for the role of evaluating program success.

The Secretaries agree that the ideas presented by the commenter, including that relating to agreements among stakeholders,
are good ones. While the Secretaries think that stakeholder agreements may be very effective ways of ensuring meaningful
collaboration, they are opposed to making them mandatory. Rather, each State is allowed the flexibility to determine
the best way to ensure effective collaboration among the stakeholders and the specific methods and processes by which
the progress of its program will be reviewed and assessed.

The Secretaries seek to establish systems that will result in the attainment of a high school diploma or its equivalent,
and a skill certificate, for all students. States have the flexibility to provide support services to students who
may require additional resources to obtain the outcomes sought to be achieved under the program. However, as has been
discussed above, the Secretaries do not intend to discourage the participation of students with disabilities in
State School-to-Work Opportunities programs. Indeed, the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is intended
to serve all students. Accordingly, the Secretaries include within the term ``equivalent,'' which has been added
to the definition of ``career major,'' certificates which States may choose to provide to students with disabilities.
These are considered to be equivalent to high school diplomas.

One commenter considered the three program components contained in the October 14, 1993 notice to be inadequate and
suggested that a section for support activities like counseling, child care, and transportation, be added. The commenter
felt that without these support activities, programs would not attract and hold students who were drop-outs, young
parents, or disadvantaged, and whose past lack of success had been due to the unavailability of such services.

The program components required in the notice define the core elements of a School-to-Work Opportunities program.
The Secretaries recognize that other support services may be necessary to help students fully participate in the
program, particularly in the case of disadvantaged or disabled students, and in the case of dropouts. The Secretaries
do not, however, wish to render such additional services mandatory in all cases. Moreover, under the notice, States
are already required to ensure opportunities for ``low-achieving students, students with disabilities, and former
students who have dropped out of school to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs.'' This will mean
in some cases, providing support services. Also, it is important to note that funds under this competition may be used
for support services. In addition, under the priority, States are required to describe how their School-to-Work
Opportunities systems will coordinate the use of education and training funds from State and private sources with
funds available from related Federal programs. (See paragraph (b)(4) of the priority.)

 The Secretaries agree with the commenter that the reference to instruction in a variety of elements of an industry
should not be a reference that is limited to the work-based component of the program. Further, as previously discussed,
there has been a change from use of the term ``Elements of the industry'' in the October 14, 1993 notice, to use of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters felt that businesses may experience difficulty in providing students with paid work experience,
particularly special needs students. One commenter stated that the proposed requirements for work-based learning
ignore the basic reality that only a small minority of firms now provide significant training to their own line workers
below the management level_let alone to ``marginal'' high school youth. This commenter believed that the requirements
for work-based learning should be expanded to include school-based work placements such as student-run enterprises
and school-sponsored community service programs, provided they are of sufficient quality and intensity to otherwise
meet the quality requirements of the initiative.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretaries believe that paid work experience is an important component of work-based learning in school-to-work
programs. Experts consulted in the development of this priority and in the development of the proposed School-to-Work
Opportunities legislation strongly believe that jobs with pay increase employment experience for youth, as well
as increasing the value and importance of the youth to the employer. Studies confirm these beliefs. Employers have
continually pointed out that paying wages is not the primary consideration in their decision of whether or not to participate
in school-to-work programs. Small and medium sized businesses have a special incentive since these have been found
to be the most significant sources of employment for youth. At the same time, however, the Secretaries agree that it
is important for partnerships to have as much flexibility as possible in developing school-to-work programs, including
having input on how the paid work experience is constructed. For that reason, the priority provides substantial flexibility.
The priority does not require a minimum amount of paid work experience nor does it specify at which point in a program
the paid work experience must occur. School-based enterprises can provide the contexts in which the paid work experience
requirement could be met. In addition, other non-paid work experience, such as job shadowing or on-the-job training
for academic credit, are not precluded by this priority, as complements to the paid work experience component.

 One commenter believed that the October 14, 1993 notice provides no real incentive for employers, particularly small

of an existing incentive in their implementation of their School-to-Work programs.

 The Secretaries agree with the commenter that there are many existing vehicles, such as Targeted Jobs Tax Credits,
of which employers can avail themselves in the context of their involvement as partners in their States' School-to-Work
Opportunities programs. In the course of providing technical assistance to the various States receiving funding
under this competition, the Secretaries plan to inform States of any additional Federal resources, programs, or
initiatives that may assist States, partnerships, and members of partnerships, in meeting the goals of the initiative
and in implementing their State School-to-Work Opportunities plans. Importantly, there may be instances where
it will be possible to use Job Training Partnership Act funds to pay for work-based activities for economically disadvantaged

 Under the School-to-Work Opportunities program, students receive academic instruction from teachers at the school
setting, while receiving hands-on, work experience, including paid work experience, from workplace mentors at
the job site. The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is intended to break down barriers between school and
work and to provide States and local partnerships with flexibility to design programs that contain the basic program
components within the local context. Assuming that requirements of the three core components are otherwise satisfied,
some degree of overlap between the work-based and the school-based learning components, would not necessarily be
impermissible, and may, at times, be appropriate.

 The Secretaries agree with the commenter that a demonstration of industry-wide commitment to the School-to-Work
Opportunities program by any participating State is important toward ensuring that employers are seriously committed
to their State's program and that all students are provided with adequate industry-wide exposure. Conversely, employer
involvement is important in ensuring that School-to-Work Opportunity programs are responsive to business needs.
However, under the ``Comprehensive Statewide System'' selection criterion and the ``Collaboration and Involvement
of Key Partners'' selection criterion, the notice already addresses the commenter's concerns. Under these criteria,
States must demonstrate and describe the commitment of employers and of State agency officials responsible for job
training and employment.

The Secretaries agree with the commenter that community colleges and programs sponsored by community colleges can
make a significant contribution to statewide school-to-work initiatives and systems. In applying under this competition,
States are to ``describe the procedure for obtaining the active and continued involvement in the statewide School-to-Work
Opportunities system of employers and other interested parties such as *&blank;*&blank;* postsecondary educational
institutions *&blank;*&blank;*.'' As the commenter notes, it is very possible that a co-op program could be included
as part of a School-to-Work Opportunity system, so long as it meets the basic program requirements. The Secretaries
would expect States to discuss in their plans how they will build on, modify, and enrich the efforts of community colleges
to develop comprehensive School-to-Work Opportunities systems that meet the requirements of this priority.

One commenter stated that School-to-Work Opportunities systems will never achieve their intended goal of creating
high-quality opportunities for all American youth unless programs contain: (1) ``Enabling tools'' to provide students
and parents with the information, assistance, capacity, and (2) safeguards necessary to obtain the opportunities
promised by the School-to-Work Opportunities program. The commenter believed that it was necessary to provide parents
with: (a) An unambiguous statement targeted to all youth of the opportunities provided by the program; (b) the information,
assistance, and authority for targeted youth and their parents to obtain access to program opportunities, participate
in shaping programs, and remedy the problems that will inevitably occur; (c) systems for ensuring that information
about these program opportunities and involvement in shaping the programs extends beyond the school district central
offices to the teachers; and (d) a statement of responsibilities for both technical assistance and overseeing local
implementation.

The Secretaries agree that providing program information to both parents and students, is essential to a student's
successful participation in, and completion of, a School-to-Work Opportunities program. For that reason, they
have added under ``examples of statewide activities,'' the clause ``working with localities to develop strategies
to recruit and retain all students in programs, including those from a broad range of backgrounds and circumstances,''
and, as an example of activities for local partnerships, they have added the clause ``conducting outreach to all students
in a manner that most appropriately meets the needs of their communities.'' Also, under paragraph (b)(3) of the priority,
States are required to describe their procedure for obtaining the continued involvement of ``employers and other
interested parties, such as *&blank;*&blank;* students, parents *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Moreover, under the Student
Participation selection criterion, the Secretaries will evaluate whether each State has proposed realistic strategies
and programs to ensure that all students have the opportunity to participate in the State's School-to-Work Opportunities
program. The Secretaries expect that a part of each State's strategy for ensuring participation would be providing
information to all students about opportunities that are available to them within the program. However, beyond these
provisions, the Secretaries are opposed to imposing further requirements upon States governing the formulation
and nature of the program information disseminated.

One commenter observed that the academic outcomes expected from school-based learning should qualify students
to enter and succeed in four-year postsecondary institutions upon graduation from high school. This commenter saw
a significant possibility that students who enter a School-to-Work Opportunities program will face barriers to
the full range of postsecondary institutions, feeding parents' and educators' tracking concerns. The commenter
also believed that the imperative for students to meet entrance requirements for four-year institutions is made
more critical by the early age at which youth will be encouraged to select a ``career major.''

The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is not limited to non-college-bound students. Rather, it is intended
for all students. The definition of the term ``All students'' refers to students from a broad range of backgrounds
and circumstances ``including *&blank;*&blank;* academically talented students.'' The notice states that career
majors would typically include two years of secondary schools and one or two years of postsecondary education. As
a result of their participation in a School-to-Work Opportunities program, students who are completing their first
or second years at the postsecondary level would be encouraged to consider different options in employment and education,
including enrollment in a four-year degree granting college or university. In addition, since students in School-to-Work
Opportunities programs will be held to high academic standards, including, where applicable, those developed under
Goals 2000, the Secretaries expect that these high standards will ensure that students who have participated in their
State's School-to-Work Opportunities program are academically prepared for enrollment in four-year postsecondary
institutions. However, in response to this comment as well as other related comments, the definition of ``career
major'' has been revised to include admission to a degree-granting college or university as a possible outcome.

is essential to the effective integration of school-based and work-based learning. Under this competition, business
and industry involvement is a requirement, as provided for in paragraph (b)(3) of the priority contained in this notice.
Plans will be reviewed for evidence of such involvement, as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of the selection criteria,
``Collaboration and Involvement of Key Partners_Involvement by key parties.'' Moreover, the School-to-Work Opportunities
program does not limit the involvement of business and industry nor limit their roles in the collaborative partnerships.
Indeed, business will necessarily play a key role in the design as well as the implementation of each State's School-to-Work
Opportunities program.

One commenter was of the opinion that there is virtually no capacity in schools or anywhere else to counsel students
on career majors and suggested that this area of the initiative be considered further. Another commenter noted that
the school-based learning component does not specify when career counseling should begin. A third commenter suggested
that, since the first bullet under ``school-based learning'' suggests that career majors may be ``reconsidered,''
a second bullet should be added immediately under it, to read: ``School-based learning that includes the integration
of occupational information and career development assistance into academic instruction and the availability
to students of direct access to that occupational information and those career development assistance tools that
relate occupational choice to educational attainment.'' The commenter believed that, without this additional
requirement, the choices made by students may not be realistic or appropriate.

The Secretaries agree that, in many cases, students do not receive the guidance and counseling needed to make important
decisions related to education and training leading to meaningful employment. It is for this reason that career exploration
and counseling is required as an important activity in the school-based learning component of the notice. States
seeking to receive a grant under this competition must demonstrate that the school-based learning component of their
School-to-Work Opportunities systems will include career exploration and counseling. In addition, however, in
response to the commenter's concerns, the Secretaries have revised the School-based Learning component to require,
among other stated elements, ``career awareness and exploration and counseling (beginning at the earliest possible
age)'' in order to help those students who may be interested, to identify and select or reconsider, their interests,
goals, and career majors, ``including those options that may not be traditional for their gender, race or ethnicity.''
By this change, the Secretaries wish to emphasize the importance of career awareness and exploration at an early age.
The determination of the actual age or grade level at which this activity should begin, has been left to the States.

The commenter believed that the information should include annual participation and post-program outcomes, and

Indeed, under paragraph (b)(4) of the priority, States are specifically required to describe how their School-to-Work
Opportunities systems will coordinate the use of education and training funds from State and private sources with

may work ``with localities to develop strategies to recruit and retain all students in School-To-Work Opportunities
programs, including those from a broad range of backgrounds and circumstances.''

One commenter felt that the Secretaries should require local partnerships to describe how they will train counselors
and other personnel to provide minority, female, disabled, and limited-English proficient youth with access to
high-skill, high-wage, non-traditional careers. The commenter believed that such a requirement should be included
in this section on ``Allocation of Funds to Local Partnerships'' and that it should be given as an example in the succeeding
section, ``Examples of Activities for Local Partnerships.''

The Secretaries agree that training is an important activity, and have included ``training for teachers, employers,
workplace mentors, counselors, and others,'' as examples of State activities and ``providing training to work-based
and school-based staff on new curricula, student assessments, student guidance, and feedback to the school regarding
student performance,'' as examples of local partnership activities. Also, one of the requirements under school-based
learning is ``career awareness and career exploration and counseling in order to help students who may be interested
to identify and select or reconsider their interests, goals, and career majors.'' The Secretaries do not wish to mandate
to local partnerships who should be trained or how the training should be accomplished. Rather, the Secretaries think
it is preferable for local partnerships to make those determinations in ways that best serve the programs which they
are implementing and the students participating in those programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters had suggestions regarding the ``Examples of Activities for Local Partnerships'' provided in the
notice. One commenter believed that paragraph (f) (redesignated as paragraph (g)) should be changed to specifically
allow students with disabilities to participate in graduation assistance programs to help them graduate from high
school, continue their education or training, and to find jobs as well as advance in them. The second commenter requested
the Secretaries to add the word, ``all,'' before ``at risk and low-achieving students'' in paragraph (f) (redesignated
as paragraph (g)). The commenter felt that this change was necessary to ensure that all categories of students listed
in the definition of ``All students'' would be served. The commenter also suggested changing the last phrase in paragraph
(f) of the October 14, 1993 notice, to read, ``*&blank;*&blank;* and finding, maintaining or advancing in jobs,''
to emphasize that maintaining a job is equally as important as finding one.

 The Secretaries agree with commenters that graduation assistance programs should be geared to serving all students,
as defined in the notice, and that the activity described in redesignated paragraph (g) should clearly refer to disabled
students as well as to at-risk and low-achieving students. The Secretaries also believe that ``maintaining a job''
is consistent with the desired outcomes of the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative and of this competition,
and have added the word, ``maintaining'' to redesignated paragraph (g) of the ``Examples of Activities for Local
Partnerships.'' The commenter on the availability of occupational information and career development assistance
has suggested two, among what may be many, additional worthwhile activities that might be carried out under a local
partnership. The Secretaries, because this section is purely illustrative and in the interest of brevity, have elected
not to include them in the final priority. Although the Secretaries find commendable, the suggestion to require that
all at-risk and low-achieving students be served in a graduation assistance program, the Secretaries fully understand
the difference between ``equal access to opportunity'' and a ``guarantee,'' and, because of the limited resources
available, have elected to have local partnerships provide ``opportunity for all students'' in preference to a guarantee.

 The notice has been modified by adding the word, ``disabled'' to redesignated paragraph (g) in the section on ``Examples
of Activities for Local Partnerships,'' so that it now reads: ``*&blank;*&blank;* a graduation assistance program
to assist at-risk, disabled, and low-achieving students, in graduating from high school. *&blank;*&blank;*.''
In addition, the Secretaries have modified this same paragraph by adding the word ``maintaining'' to the end of the
paragraph. Accordingly, the notice now provides, specifically, that funds awarded by States to local partnerships
under this competition may be utilized for the purpose of assisting at-risk, disabled, and low-achieving students
in graduating from high school, enrolling in postsecondary education or training, and finding, maintaining, or
advancing in jobs.

 One commenter, expressing concern with what he referred to as decisionmakers' access to occupational information,
suggested adding two activities to the list of activities for local partnerships. The commenter suggested revising
paragraph (h) to specifically authorize the creation of after school, School-to-Work career centers, where students
and parents could seek occupational and career information, carry out career exploration, seek guidance regarding
career choices or the design of an educational program, or evaluate the educational preparation that students have
received to date. The commenter also suggested adding a paragraph to authorize the publication of career information
for use by parents and students, in cooperation with the State Occupational Information Coordinating Committee.

 One commenter felt that the notice's references to youth for example, in paragraph (h) of Examples of Activities for
Local Partnerships in the context of providing opportunities for dropout students were unclear. The commenter suggested
defining the term ``youth'' so as to include, at a minimum, young persons up to, and including, age 25, to allow for the
inclusion of young men and women who have dropped out, become parents, and face multiple obstacles to achieving a self-sufficient
wage. Another commenter believed that defining the term ``youth'' to include students in the elementary grades would
enhance the opportunities of children to develop early career awareness, thereby increasing School-to-Work Opportunities
program participation rates in the high schools.

 Since the focus of the School-to-Work initiative and of this notice is on system building and institutional change,
there are no detailed provisions for individual eligibility. The Secretaries believe that States should have the
flexibility to determine the age range of the student population for their School-to-Work Opportunities programs.
However, States are expected to develop systems that coordinate other education and training programs funded from
sources that do set parameters for the youth to be served. For example, the Job Training Partnership Act limits the
age of the youth to be served to 16 through 21 years of age. In addition, the required school-based learning component
must include career awareness and career exploration and counseling. These activities may be carried out in the elementary
and middle school years to better prepare students for School-to-Work Opportunities programs, as States and localities
retain the flexibility to begin career awareness and counseling programs at as early a grade level as appears to be
appropriate and useful.

 One commenter felt that a student's eligibility to participate in a School-to-Work Opportunities program should
not be determined by student population based on age, such as age 16 through 21, but rather should be geared to grade
level. The commenter believed that a student's eligibility to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities program
should begin in ninth grade, since, in this way, all students would have an equal opportunity to qualify for the program.

 Regarding the applicability of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Secretaries note that, as a matter of law, this notice
does not and cannot in any way modify or affect either the Fair Labor Standards Act or its applicability. However, the
Secretaries agree with the commenter's suggestion that a reference to applicable fair labor standards would be helpful
in the context of the ``Safeguards'' section of the notice. Regarding the commenter's suggestion that additional
safeguards be added to the list, the Secretaries do not believe that this is necessary, since relevant Federal and
State law will continue to apply to this program, regardless of whether these are specifically mentioned or listed
in the notice.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In making choices among standards and assessments for occupational skills, one commenter suggested that States
be required to consider whether the standards and assessments chosen reflect the needs of high-performance workplaces,
whether they are benchmarked to the highest international standards, and whether they reflect requirements of clusters
of occupations requiring similar skills, rather than individual jobs or occupations. The commenter suggested that
among the needs of high performance work organizations are the acquisition of skills required to be an effective member
of a work group, the capacity to learn new skills quickly, broad analytical and systems thinking skills, and specific
skill sets that facilitate high mobility among a wide variety of related jobs and occupations within an industry and
among different industries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretaries agree that State skill standards and methods of skill assessment must be benchmarked to high quality
standards in order to ensure, to the extent possible, that students receiving portable skill certificates under
the School-to-Work Opportunities program will have the opportunity to enter high-skill, high-wage, employment.
Therefore, the clause ``benchmarked to high quality standards'' is added to the definition of the term ``Skill certificate.''
Similarly, a question has been added to the ``Comprehensive Statewide Systems'' selection criterion requiring
States to indicate in their applications whether their processes for assessing skills reflect the needs of high performance
workplaces as well as meeting the requirements of broad clusters of related occupations and industries, rather than
those of individual jobs or occupations. The Secretaries generally agree with the commenter that, in making their
choices among standards and assessments for occupational skills, States should choose standards and assessments
that build upon available standards and assessments; incorporate those skills that are necessary for employees
to participate as active members of a work group and serve as team leaders; utilize high standards in an industry, occupation
or profession; include measures of broad analytical and thinking skills; and reflect the requirements of clusters
of occupations, requiring similar skills, rather than narrowly-defined individual jobs or occupations.

of job training and experiences, paid work experience, workplace mentoring, and a program of study designed to meet
the same challenging academic standards developed for all students. The criterion ``Comprehensive Statewide System''

the plan describe methods to ensure high school completion by participants such as graduation assistance programs
targeting low-achieving and at-risk youth or offering human services in coordination with education and job training?''
One commenter was concerned that occupational and career information and career guidance and counseling be provided
and suggested adding a question to read: ``Has the State incorporated into the Statewide plan provisions for the presentation
of occupational and career information and career development assistance to all students in all parts of the State?''

The Secretaries agree with the commenter that in response to this notice applicants should describe the methods that
they have selected to ensure high school completion. The criterion ``Student Participation'', therefore, focuses
on providing ``all students'', including low-achieving students, the opportunity to participate in School-to-Work
Opportunities programs. The ``Local Programs'' criterion emphasizes that plans must include programs that result
in the award of high school diplomas, as is otherwise required in the notice. With respect to the commenter's suggestion
that statewide plans provide for the presentation of occupational and career information and career development
assistance, one of the ``General Program Requirements'' already contained in the priority, is that the school-based
learning component of any School-to-Work program include career exploration and counseling.

One commenter suggested adding State officials responsible for special education, vocational rehabilitation,
and other transition services, to the list of State level officials with whom applicants are encouraged to collaborate
in implementing statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems. Other commenters suggested adding a variety
of entities to the list of key parties to be involved in the implementation of States' School-to-Work Opportunities
systems. Specifically, commenters suggested adding vocational and comprehensive high schools, local vocational
education agencies, private industry councils established under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), related
services personnel, State Occupational Information Coordinating Committees and other occupational information
providers, human services agencies, JTPA operators and educational programs serving farmworkers. One commenter
was of the opinion that the involvement of other parties cannot serve as a substitute for the involvement of students,
parents, teachers, and area residents in State and local decision-making. The commenter also felt that the statewide
system should include as many as possible of the interested parties listed under the criterion ``Involvement by Key
Parties.''

that the other entities suggested by the commenters also would contribute to the success of State and local School-to-Work
Opportunities activities and it would be appropriate for State and local agencies to seek their involvement. In accordance

for youth, particularly youth at risk of dropping out of school at an early age.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As written, the ``Student Participation'' criterion calls for realistic strategies and programs to included all
students. In States with migrant workers and seasonal farmworkers, this would include the children of those individuals.
The Secretaries expect those students to be provided with the opportunity to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities
programs. Additionally, the Secretaries strongly encourage States to provide early intervention for youth, particularly
youth at risk of dropping out of school at an early age.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that the ``Local programs'' selection criterion be modified to permit supported employment
as a part of work-based learning. The commenter was also concerned about the participation of special education students
and suggested that the phrase ``or alternative certificate'' be added after ``award of a high school diploma.'' The
commenter also felt that the phrase ``including those funded under JTPA, IDEA, Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied
Technology Education Act (Perkins Act), the Rehabilitation Act, and JOBS'' should be added following the question
``Have promising existing programs been considered for adaptation?''

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the suggestion that the ``Local programs'' selection criterion be modified to permit supported employment
as a part of work-based learning, such a change would make the selection criterion inconsistent with the priority,
which includes a safeguard prohibiting the use of funds awarded under this competition for the payment of wages to
students. The Secretaries encourage grantees to use other Federal, State, local, public, and private resources
to provide supported employment, work study, and cooperative education where these approaches facilitate work-based
learning. With regard to the comment suggesting that alternative certificates be accepted in lieu of high school
diplomas for disabled students, the clause ``or its equivalent'' is added to this part of the notice to provide for
alternative certificates for disabled students. Finally, while the Secretaries agree with the commenter that programs
under the JTPA, IDEA, Perkins Act, Rehabilitation Act, and JOBS have produced practices that should be considered
for adaptation, other Federal, State, and local programs have also developed promising programs that States and
locals may wish to consider. The Secretaries encourage States and localities to adapt all promising programs to their
School-to-Work Opportunities systems in a manner that best suits the systems they plan to implement.

 One commenter felt that greater emphasis should be given to States that present new or alternative methods of assessment

real innovation on the part of their own staff as well as on the part of the stakeholders they have brought together.

improve or redesign the implementation system based on program outcomes?''

 One commenter was concerned about special education students and expressed the belief that interagency data collection
is essential for monitoring the success of special education programs and requested that the Secretaries add a question
to read: ``Does the State's management plan include a system for interagency data collection?'' This commenter also
requested the insertion of the word ``cross-trained'' into the question on key personnel so that it would read ``Are
key personnel under the plan cross-trained and qualified to perform&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' This commenter
believed that key personnel should be knowledgeable on both labor and educational issues.

 The Secretaries agree that the provision of occupational and career development assistance as well as program information,
guidance, and counseling, are all important aspects of School-to-Work Opportunities programs to be developed under
the priority. However, the Secretaries believe that the importance of these is already provided for in the priority
as written. While the Secretaries agree with the commenter that it would be beneficial for applicants to utilize key
personnel who are knowledgeable of both the labor and educational components, the Secretaries do not think it advisable
to prescribe the qualifications of key personnel. The Secretaries prefer to leave those decisions to the States.

 One commenter was concerned about the sufficiency of occupational and career information provided under School-to-Work
Opportunities programs and suggested adding two questions to the ``Management Plan'' criterion, to read: ``Does
the State management plan adequately address the timely provision of accurate occupational and career information
to school and program administrators, teachers and counselors, students and parents throughout the State?'' and
``Does the State management plan adequately address the need to provide career development assistance, guidance
and counseling to students and parents in all parts of the State?''

 The Secretaries have concluded that, since the implementation of School-to-Work Opportunities programs will be
a joint effort involving coordination among Federal, State, and local entities, it is likely that effective methods
to improve or redesign a project's implementation will be shared among these.

 One commenter questioned the distribution of points among the selection criteria and recommended that the points
be redistributed with 20 points for the ``Comprehensive Statewide System'' criterion, 17 points for the ``Collaboration
and Involvement of Key Partners'' criterion, 17 points for the ``Resources'' criterion (particularly if the disadvantaged
are to meet the same goals as other students), 17 points for the ``Student Participation'' criterion, 17 points for
the ``Local Programs'' criterion, and 12 points for the ``Management Plan'' criterion. Another commenter concerned
with special education students suggested that more points be awarded for the ``Local Programs'' selection criterion.

 One commenter believed the notice must be strengthened to ensure that all youth receive the assistance and services
they need to fully participate and succeed and processes are in place for identifying and addressing disparities
in participation and success. The commenter recommended that the Secretaries add a selection factor that reads:
``Are there adequate State and local provisions to ensure equal access to all programs and program components; supplemental
services and accommodations necessary for various students to participate and succeed; the collecting of disaggregated
data on how well different groups are being served; and the taking of effective steps to remedy unequal participation
or outcomes (based on data concerning how groups need to be served)?''

 In reviewing applications under this competition, the Secretaries will seek to determine the extent to which applications
propose realistic strategies and programs to ensure that ``all students'' have an opportunity to participate in
the State's School-to-Work Opportunities programs. In order to succeed in a School-to-Work Opportunities program,
some students may need additional assistance. In this regard, the selection criterion ``Student Participation''
will be used to assess applicants' strategies for recognizing barriers to participation and proposing effective
ways of overcoming them. However, the program funded under this competition does not purport to guarantee access
to every student.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that the selection criteria consider the extent and quality of a State's implementation
of key Perkins Act provisions, including all aspects of the industry, academic-vocational integration, full access,
services and success for individuals who are members of special populations, and effective participatory planning
with students, parents, teachers, and area residents in terms of: (a) the extent of the State's current implementation
of those provisions, and (b) how they will be coordinated with and incorporated into the comprehensive school-to-work
system. This commenter believed the individual States' track records in implementing these Perkins Act provisions
would be good indicators of their capacities for commitments to high quality implementation of School-to-Work Opportunities
systems.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the School-to-Work Opportunities system to be developed and implemented under the priority will involve
the coordination of education and training resources of many different Federal, State, and private sources, the
Secretaries believe that a State's track record in implementing Perkins Act provisions, while important, is only
one of many critical factors that serve as indicators of commitment and ultimately contribute to a successful School-to-Work
Opportunities system. The Secretaries do not believe that giving special emphasis to a State's implementation of
provisions under the Perkins Act fosters the intent that States develop comprehensive School-to-Work Opportunities
systems that incorporate the best practices and programs regardless of funding source.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Cooperative Demonstration_School-to-Work Opportunities State Implementation Grants Program provides financial
assistance to States to establish comprehensive, statewide, School-to-Work Opportunities systems. These systems
will offer young Americans access to education and training programs designed to prepare them for a first job in high-skill,
high-wage careers, and to increase their opportunities for further education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretaries wish to highlight, for potential applicants, that this program can help to further National Education
Goals 3 and 5_Goal 3, American students will leave grades four, eight, and twelve having demonstrated competency
in challenging subject matter including English, mathematics, science, history, and geography; and every school
in America will ensure that all students learn to use their minds well, so they may be prepared for responsible citizenship,
further learning, and productive employment in our modern economy. The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative
also meets Goal 5 by helping to ensure that every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and
skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.
