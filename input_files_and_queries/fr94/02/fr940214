Statutory Background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is issued pursuant to the provisions of the 1938 Act and the 1949 Act. Section 1108(c) of Public Law 99&hyph;272
provides that the determinations made in this rule are not subject to the provisions for public participation in rule
making contained in 5 U.S.C. 553 or in any directive of the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 15, 1993, the Secretary announced the national marketing quota and price support level for the 1994 crop
of flue-cured tobacco. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Marketing Quota 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 317(a)(1)(b) of the 1938 Act provides, in part, that the national marketing quota for a marketing year for
flue-cured tobacco is the quantity of such tobacco that is not more than 103 percent nor less than 97 percent of the total
of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The amount of flue-cured tobacco that domestic manufacturers of cigarettes estimate they intend to purchase
on U.S. auction markets or from producers, (2) the average quantity exported annually from the U.S. during the three
marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made, and (3) the quantity,
if any, that the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, determines necessary to adjust loan stocks to the reserve
stock level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 317(a)(1)(c) further provides that, with respect to the 1990 through 1994 marketing years, any reduction
in the national marketing quota being determined shall not exceed 10 percent of the previous year's national marketing
quota. The reserve stock level is defined in section 301(b)(14)(C) of the 1938 Act as the greater of 100 million pounds
or 15 percent of the national marketing quota for flue-cured tobacco for the marketing year immediately preceding
the marketing year for which the level is being determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 320A of the 1938 Act provides that all domestic manufacturers of cigarettes with more than 1 percent of U.S.
cigarette production and sales shall submit to the Secretary a statement of purchase intentions for the 1994 crop
of flue-cured tobacco by December 1, 1993. Six such manufacturers were required to submit such a statement for the
1994 crop and the total of their intended purchases for the 1994 crop is 288.0 million pounds. The three-year average
of exports is 391.3 million pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The national marketing quota for the 1993 crop year was 891.8 million pounds (58 FR 11960). Thus, in accordance with
section 301 (b)(14)(C), the reserve stock level for use in determining the 1994 marketing quota for flue-cured tobacco
is 133.8 million pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of December 6, 1993, the Flue-Cured Tobacco Stabilization Corporation had in its inventory 316.8 million pounds
of flue-cured tobacco (excluding pre-1985 stocks committed to be purchased by manufacturers and covered by deferred
sales). Accordingly, the adjustment to maintain loan stocks at the reserve supply level is a decrease of 183.0 million
pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total of the three marketing quota components for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year is 496.3 million pounds. However,
the 1994 national marketing quota cannot be less than 90 percent of 1993's quota. Accordingly, the national marketing
quota for the marketing year beginning July 1, 1994, for flue-cured tobacco is 802.6 million pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 317(a)(2) of the 1938 Act provides that the national average yield goal be set at a level that the Secretary
determines will improve or ensure the useability of the tobacco and increase the net return per pound to the growers.
Yields in crop year 1993 did not change significantly from the previous year. Accordingly, the national average yield
goal for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year will be 2,088 pounds per acre, the same as last year's level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 317(a)(3) of the 1938 Act, the national acreage allotment for the 1994 crop of flue-cured
tobacco is determined to be 384,386.97 acres, derived from dividing the national marketing quota by the national
average yield goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 317(e) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary is authorized to establish a national reserve from
the national acreage allotment in an amount equivalent to not more than 3 percent of the national acreage allotment
for the purpose of making corrections in farm acreage allotments, adjusting for inequities, and for establishing
allotments for new farms. The Secretary has determined that a national reserve for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco
of 744 acres is adequate for these purposes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 317(a)(4) of the 1938 Act, the national acreage factor for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco
for uniformly adjusting the acreage allotment of each farm is determined to be 0.90, which is the result of dividing
the 1994 national allotment (384,386.97 acres) minus the national reserve (744 acres) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the total of allotments established for flue-cured tobacco farms in 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(426,268.80 acres). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 317(a)(7) of the 1938 Act, the national yield factor for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco
is determined to be 0.9255, which is the result of dividing the national average yield goal (2,088 pounds) by a weighted
national average yield (2,256 pounds).

Price Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Price support is required to be made available for each crop of a kind of tobacco for which quotas are in effect, or for
which marketing quotas have not been disapproved by producers, at a level determined in accordance with a formula
prescribed in section 106 of the 1949 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco, the level of support is determined in accordance with sections
106 (d) and (f) of the 1949 Act. Section 106(f)(7)(A) of the 1949 Act provides that the level of support for the 1994 crop
of flue-cured tobacco shall be: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The level, in cents per pound, at which the 1993 crop of flue-cured tobacco was supported, plus or minus, respectively,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An adjustment of not less than 65 percent nor more than 100 percent of the total, as determined by the Secretary after
taking into consideration the supply of the kind of tobacco involved in relation to demand, of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 66.7 percent of the amount by which: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) The average price received by producers for flue-cured tobacco on the United States auction markets, as determined
by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination
is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was
the lowest in such period, is greater or less than: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(II) The average price received by producers for flue-cured tobacco on the United States auction markets, as determined
by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year prior to the marketing year
for which the determination is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year
in which the average price was the lowest in such period; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 33.3 percent of the change, expressed as a cost per pound of tobacco, in the index of prices paid by the tobacco producers
from January 1 to December 31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the determination is made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The difference between the two 5-year averages (i.e., the difference between (A) (I) and (II)) is 0.5 cents per pound.
The difference in the cost index from January 1 to December 31, 1993, is 1.6 cents per pound. Applying these components
to the price support formula (0.5 cents per pound, two-thirds weight; 1.6 cents per pound, one-third weight) results
in a weighted total of 0.9 cents per pound. As indicated, section 106 provides that the Secretary may, on the basis of
supply and demand conditions, limit the change in the price support level to no less than 65 percent of that amount.
In order to remain competitive in foreign and domestic markets, the Secretary used his discretion to limit the increase
to 65 percent of the maximum allowable increase. Accordingly, the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco will be supported
at 158.3 cents per pound, 0.6 cents higher than in 1993.

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an amended
interim final rule that decreased the level of authorized expenses and reduced the assessment rate that generates
funds to pay those expenses. Authorization of this budget enables the Florida Celery Committee (Committee) to incur
expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are derived
from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is effective under Marketing Agreement No. 149 and Order No. 967, both as amended (7 CFR part 967), regulating
the handling of celery grown in Florida. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, Florida celery is subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will
be applicable to all assessable celery handled during the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year, from August 1, 1993, through
July 31, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately seven producers of Florida celery under this marketing order, and approximately seven handlers.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $3,500,000. The majority of Florida celery producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget of expenses for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for
local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee
are producers and handlers of Florida celery. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs of goods
and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated
and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and
provide input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of Florida celery. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will
provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee met June 9, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993&hyph;94 budget of $90,000 and an assessment rate
of $0.02 per crate. The expenses and assessment rate were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an interim final rule July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38277). That interim final rule added &sect;967.228, authorizing expenses
and establishing an assessment rate for the Committee, and provided that interested persons could file comments
through August 16, 1993. No comments were filed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee budgeted $45,000 to the American Celery Council for promotional and merchandising activities. However,
the Council is no longer in business. The Committee subsequently met on October 6, 1993, and unanimously recommended
a decrease of $45,000 for promotion, merchandising, and public relations; reducing funding for the category to $15,000.
This action reduces the total Committee budget for fiscal year 1993&hyph;94 to $45,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended reducing the assessment rate by $0.01, for a total of $0.01. This rate,
when applied to anticipated shipments of 4,500,000 crates, will yield $45,000 in assessment income. Funds in the
Committee's authorized reserve as of July 31, 1992, were $27,853, which is within the maximum permitted by the order
of one marketing year's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An amended interim final rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62033). That interim final rule amended &sect;967.228 to decrease the level of authorized
expenses and reduce the assessment rate for the Committee. That rule provided that interested persons could file
comments through December 27, 1993. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year began on August 1, 1993. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal period apply to all assessable celery handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware
of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the

Notice of Proposed Suspension: Issued December 7, 1993; published December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65135). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This action
will encourage milk production during the months of July and August, which are months of declining milk production.

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. This rule does not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and request a modification of an order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry
of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the
rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part
900).

Statement of Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This suspension removes the requirement that producers be paid on the basis of the base and excess plan for the months
of July and August 1994. The proposal was submitted by Carolina/Virginia Milk Producers Association, Inc., Dairymen,
Inc., and Southern Milk Sales, Inc. These cooperative associations have a substantial amount of milk pooled on the
Georgia milk market. In support of their proposal, the cooperative associations state that the suspension is needed
because in recent years milk in this area has been in short supply during July and August. Without the suspension, the
cooperatives contend the market's base and excess plan would discourage production in those months. They further
state that it is necessary to take this action well before the proposed suspension takes effect to address the desire
of individual dairy farmers to have knowledge of the base payment period prior to any base purchases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several producers in Georgia filed comments in opposition to the proposed suspension. The producers state that the
proposed suspension would force them to be paid on the blend price which would reduce the price they receive for their
milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the order's base and excess plan, producers establish ``base'' on the basis of their production during the months
of September through January and are paid on the basis of their ``base'' and ``excess'' milk during the following months
of February through August. The plan was suspended during August 1993, the most recent base-paying month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the suspension of the base and excess payment plan in July and August, producers would be paid a blend price for
all of their milk during those months. In July 1993, the last month the base and excess payment plan was operative, there
was a 24-cent difference between the blend price and the base price. The difference between the blend price and the
excess price however, was $3.96. Thus, while it is true that, without the plan, producers would receive somewhat less
for their base milk, this difference is far less than the $3.96 difference between the blend price and the excess price,
which is a major impediment to keeping milk that is in excess of base milk on the market. It is also a major obstacle to
fluid milk handlers in attracting supplemental milk supplies on a direct-shipped basis from producers in nearby
markets. Under the plan, such producers would be only entitled to the excess price for all of their milk shipped to the
market because they had not earned base in the Georgia market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the past two years, the Class I utilization of producer milk tightened markedly during the months of July and
August. For example, the Class I utilization in 1992 increased from 74.9 percent in June to 75.5 percent in July and
to 79.7 percent in August. In 1993, the Class I utilization similarly increased from 77.6 percent in June to 89.7 percent
in July and to 84.4 percent in August. These figures indicate that the market is extremely tight during the months of
July and August and that there is merit to the request to remove any disincentive producers may have to increasing production
or shipping supplemental milk to the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suspension will increase the amount of milk available for fluid use in the Georgia market. It will allow fluid milk
handlers to attract supplemental milk supplies from producers in nearby markets. Additionally, producers with
excess milk will not be encouraged to shift off the market in July and August and thereby detract from the basic function
of the order in assuring an adequate supply of milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefits of having an adequate supply of milk available to meet fluid needs outweigh the benefits which would accrue
to producers who would receive higher prices. Accordingly, the proposal to suspend the base and excess payment plan
during July and August 1994 is adopted.

Background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During its audits of FmHA's identity of interest construction cost certification process, the Office of Inspector
General found many instances where borrowers were taking advantage of loopholes in FmHA regulations. This resulted
in the loss of Government funds through excess profit being paid to paper contractors, failure of the borrowers to
reveal identities of interest with related parties, failure on the part of CPA's to adequately perform cost certifications,
and numerous other discrepancies of varying severity, all of which have had detrimental effects on the program. OIG
reviewed the proposed changes to the regulations and voiced its support for the proposed changes as a mean for reducing
fraud, waste, and abuse in the 515 program.

Implementation Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FmHA has stated that all preapplications and applications on hand will be subject to the final rule with the exception
of applications whose plans and specifications have been finalized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several persons agreed that preapplications and applications not be ``grandfathered'' except for those which have
received an AD&hyph;622 and which are within the District's 150 percent loan approval authority. Other persons objected
to not ``grandfathering'' because of the expense already incurred in developing an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since applicants have already invested substantial sums of money in the development of building plans, FmHA has reconsidered
this position. Building plans included with preapplications which have been issued an AD&hyph;622 inviting a formal
application will not be affected; all other material associated with preapplications will be subject to the provisions
of the final rule.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comments were received concerning the requirement that all transfers of funds between line items would require the
approval of the servicing official using Form FmHA 1924&hyph;7. The general feeling is that estimates are merely
estimates and will fluctuate during the construction period. To require the servicing official to approve change
orders for every line item change would cause a major paperwork burden on both the contractor and FmHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency recognizes the volume of paperwork and delay involved with this requirement. FmHA will, instead, implement
a means to flag significant variances in line item costs. Increases or decreases at or above a 15 percent threshold
will require documentation from the borrower to justify the differences. The State Director will also have the authority
to require documentary justification for less than 15 percent variances if he/she deems it necessary. The documentation
will be required at the time the project is cost certified so that construction will not be delayed.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most persons agreed that architectural fees should be reduced when less than full architectural services are provided.
It was suggested that it would be appropriate to establish a range of fees covering a range of similar services. It was
also pointed out that an acceptable design in one place can involve a redraw in others due to local code interpretations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The intent of this requirement is for those instances where the applicant uses a set of plans that has previously been
used. Even if a new site requires some modification to adapt the building to the site, it will not require a complete
redraw of the building. While there can be no hard and fast rules set by Washington as to the degree of revision needed
to qualify the architect for full services, this can be determined at the State level. Compensation is expected to
reasonably represent the value of the architect's services to the owner.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of persons suggested that more training be provided to FmHA field staff in analyzing the financial statement
to determine whether there is sufficient ``financial strength to carry out all phases of construction.'' Another
suggestion was that FmHA require a performance and payment bond from all contractors, in which case the credit worthiness
will have been determined by a surety company. Several persons pointed out the fact that credit reports do not reflect
the financial strength of the contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FmHA has completed phase one of a two phase training program in the proper analysis of financial reports. The training
is being conducted by an outside accounting firm and involves State, District, and National Office personnel. We
recognize that requiring a payment and performance bond from all contractors would probably eliminate the small
yet qualified contractor from participating in the 515 program. Based on the comments that a credit report is not the
vehicle through which financial strength can be determined, FmHA will require that each contractor provide a financial
statement of its operations. The financial statement will be analyzed to determine if the contractor has the financial
strength to pay construction bills prior to obtaining draws from the lender. Language relating to the submission
of a financial statement has been added to this section. A credit report will still be required from all contractors.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FmHA deleted this cost from this section because it intended to contract for cost certifications itself. This would
have eliminated the need for including the cost in the construction contract since they would be paid from Agency funds.
It has now been determined that the Agency will be unable to contract for all cost certifications, so the previous language
pertaining to cost certification expenses has been restored to this section to cover those situations where the borrower
will be required by FmHA to obtain the certification.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several persons agreed with the proposal that FmHA contract directly for cost certifications. The most consistently
expressed concern was about the delay in the Government contracting process, resulting in increased interim interest
expense. There was also some concern about the burden this proposal would place on FmHA. There was a suggestion to have
FmHA contract with a CPA to review and/or audit a certain percentage of the cost certifications within the State each
year. Also, one person suggested that FmHA allow contracts between the CPA and the contractor when the CPA can certify
that he/she has no other relationship with the contractor except for the cost certification. Comments from other
persons stated that the ongoing working relationship between the borrower and the CPA is a definite advantage since
the CPA is familiar with the accounting system and procedures of the borrower. They felt that having full-time access
to the CPA who is responsible for monitoring the construction cost recording process would allow for timely maintenance
of records. An FmHA-contracted auditor would not have this familiarity with the borrower's books. One respondent
suggested that FmHA publish a guide to tell CPA's how FmHA wants the cost certifications performed and reported. One
suggestion is that instead of contracting for cost certifications directly, FmHA should strengthen its ability
to debar an incompetent CPA. Another respondent suggested that FmHA establish a list of CPA's who have been designated
as acceptable for cost certification. One suggestion was that FmHA make a judgment of whether the borrower's cost
certification is satisfactory instead of hiring the CPA directly.

 FmHA has worked with the Office of Inspector General to develop an audit program which CPA's will follow in performing
cost certification audits. During recent OIG audits of cost certifications prepared on FmHA-financed rental housing
projects, it was discovered that many CPA's were not maintaining the independence required by generally accepted
auditing standards. It is obvious from some of the comments that some CPA's who are cost certifying construction costs
have also been involved in the maintenance of the borrowers' construction records. FmHA will not have sufficient
contracting funds to cover the cost of all certifications; therefore, it anticipates contracting for all certifications
on loans of $1.5 million and over and a random sampling of all other loans. Details will have to be worked out in the contracting
process to prevent undue delay in closing loans. In the event FmHA does contract for a cost certification, the borrower
will not be responsible for providing a certification since that would duplicate energies and expenses. Any funds
earmarked in the loan for cost certification but which are not needed because of an FmHA-contracted certification
will be returned on the loan and may not be used for any other purpose.

 There was some confusion about whether FmHA would be contracting with the CPA who examines the borrower's accounting
system or just with the CPA who performs the cost certification. A suggestion was offered that the borrower provide
a written assertion that it has an accounting system which complies with the regulations. The cost certification
CPA would then report on the validity of the assertion.

 It was the intent of this proposal that the borrower's CPA be responsible for verifying that the borrower's accounting
system meets the requirements of the regulation so that this responsibility can be removed from FmHA field personnel.
Since the Agency does not have accountants on staff, we do not feel we have the expertise to adequately check the borrower's
accounting system. We agree with the suggestion that the borrower be allowed to provide a written assertion on the
accounting system and that the cost certification CPA report on its validity. This section has been rewritten to incorporate
that suggestion.

 There was a question as to whether FmHA intends to reduce builder's profit when costs of line item are increased. Another
respondent wondered if it is the intent of FmHA to restrict the amount of each line item to the estimated amount. Several
persons objected to the restriction of general requirements to the estimated amount. One respondent recommended
that any cost savings from project construction be returned on the loan and that the loan be reamortized to reflect
a decrease in tenant rent.

FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FmHA intends that builder's profit be reduced when the total costs of the line item costs exceed their estimates and
would result in an increase in the contract amount. The amounts for general overhead, profit, and general requirements
will be restricted to their estimated amounts, not the line items to their estimated amounts. FmHA believes that the
estimates for general requirements can be accurately determined prior to the start of construction and not deviate
significantly thereafter. We do not feel this would result in an undue burden on the borrower. A refund of loan funds
can be used to reamortize the loan if it can be shown that the amount refunded will reduce the rents and an exception to
the 10 percent requirement has been granted by the National Office.

 There was some objection to requiring the borrower to agree that the tests conducted will include FmHA audit requirements.
One respondent has recommended that the language be changed to refer to FmHA 1924&hyph;A instead of ``FmHA regulations''
and has provided FmHA with suggested language for this section.

FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because of the problems with how cost certifications are conducted, as revealed by OIG, FmHA felt it necessary to institute
additional instructions to the CPA/LPA's which are intended to provide uniformity in the examination of construction
costs. FmHA sought advice and assistance from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in developing
the additional instructions referred to as the Audit Program. The Audit Program will be available in FmHA offices.
It is FmHA's intent that the borrower recognize the Audit Program and to ensure that the auditor include its requirements
in the cost certification process. The language of this section has been reworded as recommended by AICPA. FmHA has
changed the reference from FmHA regulations to FmHA Instruction 1924&hyph;A.

 One respondent objects to the auditor having to certify that he/she has no financial interest in or with the applicant/owner-builder,
architect, engineer, attorney, contractor, etc., since Government Auditing Standards prohibit such an identity
of interest. Two respondents pointed out an inconsistency in the suggested CPA opinion letter since one paragraph
refers to Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and another refers to General Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP).

FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Even though the Government Auditing Standards prohibits identities of interest between CPA's and the applicant,
architect, engineer, attorney, contractor, etc., OIG audits have revealed apparent close relationships exist
between some CPA's and borrowers. Certain CPA's have not maintained an independence from the borrower as required
by Government Auditing Standards. There is no inconsistency in the suggested opinion letter since GAGAS pertains
to the audit of the construction costs and GAAP pertains to the accounting system which the borrower uses in recording
construction costs. OIG has submitted a sample auditor's report which is incorporated in the Audit Program and available
in any FmHA office.

 The opinion was expressed that the CPA who reviews the borrower's accounting system be allowed to cost certify. Also,
costs will be duplicated if the borrower has to hire a CPA in addition to FmHA contracting for CPA services. There was
objection to denying the right of a CPA to cost certify when that CPA is currently handling the contractor's accounting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It was originally FmHA's intent that the CPA who reviews the borrower's accounting system not cost certify the project
after construction. This was primarily due to the fact that OIG audit findings revealed a lack of independence between
CPA's and borrowers. We have reconsidered this prohibition and will allow the same CPA who sets up or examines the borrowers
accounting system to certify construction costs. However, the CPA who provides any accounting services to the borrower
during construction will not be allowed to cost certify the project. To do so would be a violation of rules of independence
set forth in Government Auditing Standards.

 There was one objection to using the new forms since the respondent felt FmHA already has an identity of interest statement
in use.

FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of the new forms is twofold; one to require all borrowers to disclose all identities of interest and the
other to identify ``paper companies.'' The identity of interest statement itself has been changed to also include
other related parties. The forms also provide notification to all affected parties of the penalty for falsifying
the documents. FmHA feels these forms are needed.

 One respondent objected to having to report a discount or rebate when the original line item costs were based on the
discounted amount. Another person offered the rationale that rebates and discounts are incentives to buy ``right''
and to pay bills on time and that FmHA is attempting to remove these incentives. One respondent requested clarification
of the next to last sentence in this section. The general objection was voiced about reducing profit to agree with the
reduction in line item costs of construction. One person felt that contractors would use the pretext of obtaining
a rebate or discount in order to not contribute additional funds to cover the increase in line item costs. One respondent
supported this section.

 After due consideration, FmHA has decided that this section more appropriately pertains to multiple advance loans
where payments are made by FmHA and the amount of any discounts or rebates will be deducted before invoices are paid.
If discounts or rebates are given after the invoices are paid, the funds will be returned to the supervised bank account.
Therefore, this section has been amended to delete reference to discounts and rebates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The reference to the HUD regulatory language apparently has caused some confusion since it was merely referenced.
One respondent wanted to know if the general contractor has to hammer nails in order to be performing work. Another
respondent felt that subcontracting out all or nearly all of the work is a typical and accepted practice. One respondent
suggested that this provision be waived if it can be demonstrated that it is to the benefit of the property. One person
questioned whether this provision will pertain to everyone or just in those cases where an identity of interest exists;
if it pertains to everyone, then this section should be taken from the cost certification portion of the regulation.
One respondent requested that we provide a definition of ``actual construction.'' Two respondents requested that
a distinction be made between work on new construction and work on a rehabilitation. One respondent agreed with this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To eliminate confusion, the reference to the HUD regulation has been removed from this section. OIG audits have found
repeatedly that persons who identified themselves as the construction contractor were not qualified to build the
project or, for some reason, did not build the project. They, instead, subcontracted out all or most of the construction
and still took a full builder's profit. FmHA adamantly opposes the payment of profit to anyone who does not perform
the full range of duties of a general contractor. This section does not prohibit a contractor from subcontracting
out any or all of the work as long as that contractor does not receive a builder's profit. The Agency has no objection
to the contractor being paid for services rendered. FmHA does not foresee any situation where waiver of this provision
will benefit the property. This section pertains only to identity of interest borrowers and will remain in this location.
For purposes of clarification, we are defining ``actual construction'' to mean ``work'' as defined in A.I.A. documents:
``*&blank;*&blank;* labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's
obligations.'' Irrespective of whether the project is new construction or rehabilitation, the general contractor
should not expect to receive a builder's profit if he/she has not performed the full ranges of responsibilities of
a general contractor.

 One respondent expressed an opinion that this section will eliminate the smaller developers. There was some feeling
that this would discourage the participation of owner-builders or that it will cause undue delay in the processing
of the preapplication. One respondent recommended that the determination of whether to grant an exception to competitive
bidding be made at the application stage rather than at the preapplication stage. One respondent misinterpreted
this section to mean competitive bids would be granted rather than the negotiated contracts.

 The only new language added to this section requires that FmHA document, in writing, the examination required prior
to the State Director granting an exception to competitive bidding. We do not feel that small developers are any more
at risk now than before the change since the requirement is not new to this revision. FmHA agrees that the determination
of whether to grant an exception to competitive bidding be made during the application stage and have changed the language
to reflect this requirement. The correct meaning of this section is that negotiated contracts may be allowed once
the State Director has determined all requirements for granting an exception to competitive bidding have been met.

 One respondent asked if the requirement that projects have their costs ``audited by FmHA'' refers to cost certification
contracted by FmHA, OIG or other FmHA audit. Another respondent points out that this section contains a cost certification
cutoff for projects of $350,000 or more and expresses an opinion that there should be no difference between identity
of interest and owner-builder. One respondent points out that a FmHA 1924&hyph;13 is mandatory for all loans of over
$350,000 and that if the loan is publicly bid this form should not be mandatory.

FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The reference to ``audited by FmHA'' falls within the same provision that was discussed earlier concerning FmHA contracting
for all cost certifications. The respondent is correct in his observation concerning the $350,000 cutoff for owner-builders.
All owner-builders are identity of interest entities which automatically require a cost certification. The reference
to $350,000 has been removed from this section. FmHA regulation 1944&hyph;E now requires that all applicants submit
Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13 to facilitate the tracking of line item costs in the Agency's upcoming computerized cost tracking
system. This applies to all applicants regardless of whether or not an identity of interest is involved.

 The Administrative Notice issued on this subject addressed the percentages for establishing separate amounts for
general overhead, general requirements, and builder's profit; this section refers to the dollar amounts which are
established as a result of the percentage calculation. The FmHA 1924&hyph;13 requires that these three items be listed
separately. This section refers to establishing dollar amounts for general overhead, general requirements, and
builder's profit and that actual costs for those three items will not exceed their dollar estimates. Language addressing
the allowable percentages for general overhead, general requirements, and builder's profit has been added to &sect;1944.215(a)(1)
of subpart E of part 1944.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of objections were expressed to limiting the number of preapplications to five. Several respondents supported
this proposal. The reasons were many and too numerous to list. One respondent suggested that the limitation be based
on applications and not preapplications and that the number be controlled on a State basis. Many persons suggested
that the number of preapplications be based on the financial capacity of the applicant and not on the number of preapplications.
Other recommendations include a limit of from 3 to 15 preapplications; 5 preapplications and a nationwide limit of
10; 10 preapplications per District; 15 or 20 with no more than 5 funded and/or under construction at one time; and 10
preapplications nationwide except for preapplications accompanied by a deposit equal to 1 percent of the loan. Other
respondents recommended no limit be set for preapplications or applications. Several persons recommended returning
preapplications which cannot be funded within a set period of months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To illustrate his objection to limiting the number of preapplications, one respondent sent several photographs
of FmHA-financed apartment complexes which were not being properly managed. The respondent alleged that these apartments
were owned by small developers and the photographs serve as an example of what would happen to the section 515 program
if only small developers could participate.

FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The majority of comments were overwhelmingly opposed to restricting the number of preapplications. Therefore,
the Agency is not undertaking any changes to this section at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FmHA was concerned over the photographs and investigated the respondent's claim. In all cases, FmHA was taking action
to correct the management deficiencies. In almost all cases, the developers of the subject apartments were not small
developers. In the one case where the developer would be considered a small developer, the State did not feel the management
problems were due to the fact the developer was not a large entity. Therefore, we do not consider this particular objection
to the proposed rule to have merit.

FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ability of the borrower to furnish the contribution is a criterion of eligibility. The Agency feels that eligibility
must be established at preapplication stage. If that requirement were to be delayed until the loan is ready to be obligated,
the applicant and FmHA would have invested far too much time and money to have the applicant determined not eligible.
The 3 percent contribution was increased to 5 percent by the Community Development Act of 1992 for all projects whose
members will receive benefits from Low Income Housing Tax Credits. The regulation has already been changed to reflect
the increase in the equity contribution requirement.

 Currently, borrowers have no personal financial obligation to serve as an impetus to seeing that the project operates
successfully. We agree that such an obligation will encourage continued interest in overseeing the well-being of
the project and it makes sense from a business standpoint. Therefore, FmHA agrees that applicants should furnish
the 3 or 5 percent contribution from their own resources and have changed this section to reflect that requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several comments were received concerning the requirement that the applicant provide sufficient cash to cover start-up
costs and that a list of such materials and equipment be provided. It was felt that this was an attempt to disallow the
use of letters of credit to cover the O&amp;M expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Currently, regulations allow borrowers to provide a letter of credit to cover the total amount needed for operating
and maintenance expenses. FmHA has experienced a reluctance on the part of borrowers to draw on the letters of credit
since doing so will incur interest expenses for which they are liable. Thus, there have been many instances where there
were insufficient funds to cover needed start-up costs. Requiring the borrower to provide the requirement in cash
will ensure the availability of adequate funds with which to cover these expenses. The Housing Act of 1949, as amended,
states that ``The Secretary may require that the initial operating reserve under this section may be in the form of
an irrevocable letter of credit *&blank;*&blank;*''. This language provides the Agency the option of whether to
require letters of credit or to require the initial O&amp;M in cash. FmHA has determined that more benefits will be
derived by projects if cash is furnished for the operating reserves and, for this reason, has decided not to accept
letters of credit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of comments were received concerning restricting rehabilitation loans to no more than 5 percent of the loan
for new construction. Several of the respondents expressed their support for placing this limit on rehabilitation
loans. Also, a couple of respondents suggested that FmHA eliminate purchase and rehabilitation of historic buildings
altogether. Several respondents did not favor this proposal and misconstrued its intent as an attempt to eliminate
rehabilitation of historic buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The cost for purchasing and rehabilitating existing buildings has increased noticeably within the recent past and
has, in some cases, exceeded the amount needed for constructing new units. FmHA feels it appropriate to establish
a ceiling to ensure maximum use of loan funds. The excess cost of rehabilitation would be better spent to finance more
units in other areas of need. Therefore, the Agency feels that a limit should be placed on the amount of Government funds
being expended for rehabilitating historic buildings. While the Agency does not wish to prohibit the purchase and
rehabilitation of historic buildings, it feels that a ceiling is needed to prevent unlimited funds from being used
for this purpose. The proposed regulation does not prohibit the borrower from infusing additional cash from its or
other sources in order to fully fund the purchase and rehabilitation. FmHA's first consideration must be to providing
rental units to its beneficiaries at the lowest cost to the tenants.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One respondent expressed an opinion that this section limits the basis of FmHA's maximum loan being 97 percent of total
development cost or appraised value. Another respondent stated it does not appear there is a specific provision to
accomplish what is required in this section. One respondent suggested adding clarification that FmHA can lend the
present market value of the site ``as improved'' and that the cost of the improvements could not be released until all
improvements were in place. One respondent recommended the section be revised to state the lower of the appraised
value or purchase price will be used to determine total development cost and the applicant's initial investment.
Another respondent recommended we restore the original language of this section. One respondent agreed that loan
funds used to purchase land may not exceed the estimated market value as established by an appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The only changes made to this section are the reference to FmHA Instruction 1922&hyph;B and deletion of the words ``in
excess of estimated market value'' in the last sentence. These changes do not alter how the loan is calculated. The
purchase price of land is not the basis for establishing the applicant's initial investment. The FmHA loan is limited
to the development cost or the security value of the project, whichever is less; the applicant is responsible for the
equity contribution whether it is in the form of land, cash, or a combination of both. After considering the comments,
we feel that this section is confusing as written since it should be addressing the amount of loan funds which can be
used to purchase land and should not include discussion of how the purchase price affects the applicant's initial
investment. The last sentence has been removed.

 There were a number of suggestions concerning the establishment of a range of costs for offsite facilities. One respondent
recommended that all offsite costs be eliminated from the loan. It was pointed out by several respondents that States
have not approved any off-site facility costs. It was also suggested that each situation is unique and should be judged
on its own merits and not be compared with past performance. One respondent felt this would place an undue burden on
FmHA and that establishing a range would not prove anything since the bottom line must be the actual ``as developed''
value of the site.

 There was generally an expression of agreement with the addition of blinds as an eligible loan purpose. One respondent,
however, suggested that we also include shades with this provision. One respondent wanted to know if individual washer/dryer
hookups could be interpreted to mean ``laundry facility.'' Another respondent voiced an opinion that washer/dryer
hookups in addition to a central laundry facility increases marketability of rental units.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FmHA has no objection to including shades in this provision and has amended the language accordingly. Laundry facilities
are defined as the actual washers and dryers facilities available to all of the tenants and not just washer and dryer
hookups. Washers and dryers owned by individual tenants are not available to all tenants and cannot be considered
as ``laundry facilities.'' FmHA stands by its previous position regarding the prohibition of placing washers and
dryers in individual units when a central laundry facility is provided unless it is customary for the area for the size
of project and type of housing involved. Washer and dryer hookups are an additional expense to overall project costs
and, in the majority of cases, are not used by the tenants. Additionally, there have been problems with the hookups
leaking and causing water damage to the units.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There were numerous objections to disallowing certain fees when the borrowing entity will receive low income housing
tax credits, primarily because the end result will be an increase in the borrower's contribution. Other respondents
felt that if certain items were required by FmHA, then those items should be funded. One respondent suggested that
FmHA automatically increase the equity requirement for low income housing tax credit projects to 5 percent rather
than to eliminate certain fees and charges. One respondent suggested that the intent be clarified to mean the legal
fees associated with closing the FmHA loan and not the interim lender loan. Another person suggested that all non-low
income housing tax credit projects receive an additional 10 points in the rating criteria. One respondent felt that
this provision would reduce loan costs and thereby maximize the State's funding allocation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Community Development Act of 1992 increased the equity contribution to 5 percent for borrowers whose members
will receive benefits from Low Income Housing Tax Credits. The regulation has already been changed to reflect this
increase. The original language pertaining to related costs has been restored. Legal fees pertain to the costs associated
with the FmHA loan closing only; clarification has been added to the section. FmHA does not agree with the suggestion
to allow an additional 10 points for non-low income housing tax credit projects. The purpose of the priority points
is to direct funding to the areas of greatest need and the lack of tax credits is not an indication of need.

 One respondent expressed an opinion that there should be an exception to this provision which allows the person who
has owned land for a period of at least 3 years to recover costs associated with the increase in value and betterment
of the site. Another respondent suggested the restriction be expanded to provide that there be no common interest
for at least 3 years and that the option be with the owner of public record; an exception could be made for subsequent
loans on adjacent property.

 FmHA does not agree with this suggestion. Regulations, except in the case of a broadly-based nonprofit organization,
prohibit the use of loan funds to purchase land from the applicant or a member of the applicant organization. In the
case of a nonprofit organization, the appraisal will determine the value which can be included in the loan. We think
the suggestion concerning common interest has merit and have changed this section to add a 3-year provision.

 A few respondents expressed their opinion that this provision would be burdensome and time-consuming. One respondent
pointed out that the expense of a market study is always incurred prior to the applicant's filing a preapplication.
Another respondent pointed out the language of this section does not allow for predevelopment loans from nonprofit
organizations as was originally intended.

 Since most borrowers are familiar with the process and are aware of what must be done during the preapplication and
application phase, obtaining written verification from FmHA should pose no undue delay. OIG strongly recommended
that FmHA be aware of the applicant's intention to incur debts before they are actually incurred to preclude the appearance
of giving blanket approval for all such expenses. We agree that the language does not allow for predevelopment loans
from nonprofit organizations and the language has been amended to correct this omission. We have also exempted market
studies from the prior written approval requirement since they must be completed prior to filing a preapplication.

 The Agency feels that obtaining pre-approval from the District Office will not sufficiently hamper the construction
process if the contractor and borrower react in a timely manner. The only two occurrences which will allow an increase
in per unit cost is design changes by FmHA or State or local jurisdictions or changes in financing approved by FmHA.
Neither of these events would be construed as an emergency.

 Two respondents expressed agreement with this section. Another respondent voiced an opinion that to require more
expensive building materials and, even though maintenance costs will be less, is contradictory to cost containment
goals.

FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency has witnessed what happens when cheaper building materials are used to initially control costs. The results
have been high maintenance costs over the life of the materials and the ultimate replacement of the materials. While
construction costs may be lower using the cheaper building materials, these savings are more than overshadowed by
the high maintenance costs necessary to prolong the use of the materials. FmHA strongly advocates the use of low maintenance
and long life materials in its construction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There were several comments expressed about the costs being ``locked in'' to either our cost tracking system or to
the Marshall &amp; Swift estimates, thereby not allowing any inflation increases. It was also noted that projects
with abnormally high or low costs should not be entered into the system and that only newer (one year old) projects be
tracked. It was felt that the borrower should not be responsible for resolving differences between a proposed project's
costs and those costs in the FmHA tracking system or in the Marshall &amp; Swift estimates. Another respondent suggested
that the tracking system allow for a comparison of bedroom sizes rather than project to project comparison. One respondent
felt that the tracking system should provide for a distinction between new construction and rehabilitation.

FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The new cost tracking system will allow FmHA to track by line item the costs of construction. For instance, the final
estimated cost of concrete for a proposed project will be recorded in the system at the time the loan is obligated. Once
the project has been built and the costs are certified (identity of interest projects), the certified cost of concrete
will also be recorded in the system and will become the basis for establishing a benchmark on costs. This should take
into consideration the inflationary escalation of costs during the construction period. Thereafter, the line item
costs for each new proposal will be compared with the amounts recorded in the tracking system. Local FmHA offices will
allow for future inflationary increases just as they do now. Only the projects received and processed after the tracking
system comes on line will be entered. We intended that significant differences between an applicant's cost estimates
and the estimates of our established tracking costs or Marshall &amp; Swift be resolved since FmHA will not arbitrarily
accept any estimates which appear out of line or unreasonable. We foresee the borrower's responsibility for resolving
the differences in cost as either providing justification for the differences or taking whatever action is required
to ensure the best estimates are being considered in the construction. This method of tracking construction costs
will make no distinction between numbers of bedrooms or new construction vs. rehabilitation; costs will be tracked
on a line item basis and not on a project basis.

 A few respondents suggested that FmHA establish timeframes for District and State Offices to follow during preapplication
and application review processing. Another respondent suggested that the AD&hyph;622 cover only the authorization
to develop plans and specifications and that the balance of the application not be pursued until receipt of the plans
and specifications and after the appraisal is completed. It was felt that this would reduce the time between signing
of the construction documents and the start of construction.

FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 From periodic assessments made of the multi-family housing program by FmHA's National Office, it is apparent that
the field staff's time is being utilized to its fullest extent. The large volume of preapplications being filed has
placed a considerable burden on the field, particularly when those preapplications which will not continue to be
processed because of their rating must still receive some degree of attention. To place timeframes on the field for
each step of processing would be unrealistic since they would most likely be impossible for the staff to meet. We do
not agree that authorizing just the completion of plans and specifications would reduce the time between signing
of the construction contract and the actual start of construction, since there are many other items needed to complete
the application and these could not be addressed until we authorized the applicant to proceed to a full application.
The cost estimates should be updated at the time the construction contract is signed so that the most up-to-date estimates
are obtained prior to approving the loan.

 FmHA feels that more diligent efforts could be expended by applicants in locating more viable sites. Sites which have
sections unsuitable for building should be avoided. However, if a situation exists where the only available site
is of a size, shape, or condition which makes a portion unsuitable for building and the only alternative is to not provide
units, then a request to the State Office for an exception to this density requirement may be considered. Such language
has been added to the section.

 The hiring of construction inspectors is a suggestion which may or may not be possible to follow. If not, it may be possible
for States to contract for these services. The comment about not having timely construction inspections by FmHA provides
an appropriate case-in-point for adequate inspection coverages. This subject will be discussed at future training
meetings with the field staff. FmHA feels that the proposed language is appropriate as proposed.

 FmHA feels this is an overreaction and that this section will not lead to the construction of boxes. We have observed,
in many States, how a simple yet attractive design is an asset to the community. These types of simple designs do not
deter potential tenants from seeking residency. The Agency feels that the design of some of the housing units now in
existence have gone beyond what is necessary to provide decent, safe, and sanitary living units. The Housing Act of
1949, as amended, specifies that ``no loan shall be made or insured *&blank;*&blank;* unless the Secretary finds
that the construction involved will be undertaken in an economical manner and will not be of elaborate or extravagant
design or materials.''

 FmHA agrees with the argument against setting the lower slopes in cases where there are heavy snow loads. The wording

The Agency disagrees with the opinion that these slopes will result in a lack of building interest.

 FmHA does not feel that the use of repeat designs will have any detrimental effect on the aesthetic value of FmHA-financed
units. In fact, several States now require the use of repeat designs without detrimental effects. The National Office
assesses the 515 program in multiple States each year, which includes a visual inspection of the rental stock. We have
not found the use of repeat designs to be offensive or boring in any State. FmHA feels that the submission of new designs
for all projects needlessly increases the amount of Government funds needed since the amount of architectural fees
is based on the level of services provided. Repeat designs will decrease the amount being paid for architectural fees
since the use of ``shelf'' plans will reduce the detailed architectural services needed.

FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Community and congregate dining room furniture is the responsibility of the borrower and its expense should be covered
by the initial O&amp;M funds. Outdoor recreation facilities for family projects are allowable loan expenses and
are intended to substitute for community room facilities allowed in elderly projects. The Agency considers community
rooms to be an essential part of the daily living requirement for those elderly projects which can support the additional
expense of the facilities. The obvious reason for not allowing community rooms in family projects is that family activities
are not necessarily curtailed by age or climate and they are more mobile than elderly residents, which means their
choice of entertainment can extend beyond their living accommodations. FmHA does not feel that garbage disposals
are necessary and has recommended against financing them in the past. In addition to the initial cost of the disposal
units, too often problems develop because of lack of care in what is processed through them, resulting in additional
expense of the repairs. FmHA does not agree that sliding glass doors are necessary even when patios/balconies are
customary for the area. FmHA contends that if a developmentally disabled person requires whirlpool therapy, then
it should fall within the responsibility of a professional to provide the service at a therapist's facility. Some
of the States which were previously allowing bay/box/picture windows have discontinued this practice in accordance
with the efforts to contain costs, an action which we support.

 FmHA views the community room as instrumental in encouraging elderly tenant socialization. In a recent survey conducted
by the National Association of Home Builders, tenants were asked to list amenities in order of their desirability.
This survey showed that balconies were ranked by the tenants at number 15 out of a list of 16 amenities. We place individual
patios in the same category with balconies. See discussion of washer and dryer hookups under &sect;1944.212(g),

 Playground equipment would either stand idle in the case where there were no minors living with the elderly or would
attract children from outside the project. The noise generated as a result of playgrounds would not be viewed as a welcome
addition by some of the elderly residents who enjoy peaceful surroundings. FmHA response to community rooms for family

for congregate parking spaces is based on that percentage. In order to accommodate the additional cars owned by persons
in elderly projects, we have changed the language of this section to allow for additional spaces for visitors and staff.

 One respondent recommended that congregate projects where an expanded meal service is designed to provide meals
to all of the community's elderly citizen be exempted from the limitations of the Manual of Acceptable Practices (MAP).
The same respondent pointed out that the MAP is a supplement to an obsolete minimum property standards. Another respondent
pointed out that the MAP is not available in any FmHA office. One respondent agreed with this section.

 Several respondents objected to this way of measuring square footages. Two others objected to restricting congregate
units to 110 percent of the minimum square footages since this dimension may not allow sufficient square footages
to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. One respondent voiced the opinion that setting the
square foot limits will lead to a drop to the minimum footages and adversely impact the rentability. One respondent
recommended a lower maximum square footage. One respondent recommended eliminating the reference to ``related
facilities'' since their inclusion will distort the square footage of ``living area.''

FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The methodology described in this section for calculating living area is consistent with common industry practices.
Congregate living units are not affected by the Americans with Disabilities Act. We do not understand the concern
that setting the square foot limit will lead to a drop to the minimum footages since these ranges have been in existence
for some time and have not resulted in an automatic drop in square feet. We see no reason to lower the maximum square footage
since the size of the unit can be controlled within the allowable ranges. The section has been changed to eliminate
``related facilities'' from being included in the computation of living area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of respondents objected to FmHA's requiring the applicant to reveal the percentage of tax credits it will
seek. Several persons appeared to misinterpret the intent of the section. A few of the respondents felt that FmHA is
attempting to make the determination of the number of tax credit units the project will receive. One respondent suggested
that the section be amended to state that the ``market study'' will be subject to further examination and not the preapplication
itself. One respondent points out that if the project is requesting rental assistance, the affordability of basic
rent is irrelevant. One person recommended that the word ``percentage'' to changed to ``number'' to avoid confusion.
Several persons supported this section.

FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FmHA regulations require that the Agency determine whether a proposed project is feasible. In order for a project
to be feasible, there must be persons of sufficient incomes to support the expenses and to amortize the loan. The market
for 515 projects depends on the existence of persons with a lower level of incomes in those cases where tax credits are
awarded to the borrower. Many market analysts are still determining need based on incomes up to the moderate level.
This becomes an issue when there is not sufficient rent subsidy for all units. In order to make a proper analysis of feasibility,
we must determine the level of incomes which will be required to support the project. Even if the applicant requests
100 percent rental assistance and there is sufficient subsidy to cover all of the units, FmHA is not absolved of its
responsibility of examining feasibility. FmHA feels that it is imperative that we are aware of the number of tax credit
units anticipated so that the appropriate level of incomes can be studied. In no way does FmHA intend to become involved
in the determination of the number of tax credits assigned to a project by the State Agencies. We will, however, provide
information to the State Agencies as to the amount of financial assistance granted to the borrower by FmHA. The word
``percentage'' has been changed to ``amount'' and the words ``percentage of units targeted for tax credit eligible
persons'' have been added.

 A number of respondents supported this section with the stipulation that no other preapplication be authorized until

processing.

 FmHA agrees that the preapplication hold its position in the ranking and has amended the section to state that no other
preapplication will move ahead of the preapplication in question until the feasibility issue has been resolved.
The contracts will be similar to those used by the Agency in obtaining appraisals in that the State will let one contract
under which the market studies will be prepared by one or more market analysts. This will eliminate the need for contracting
for each individual study, thus saving processing time.

 The issuance of the closing instructions involves coordination and input from another Government Agency. While

 One respondent suggested that an appeal process be included for co-general partners. One respondent suggested that
another provision be added to allow transfer of an obligation when the applicant is unable to continue for legitimate
reasons and the transferee is eligible for 515 assistance. Another respondent suggested consideration be given
to who is responsible for the default so that a co-general partner who is innocent of the default will not be penalized
by being denied access to the program for 5 years.

 We interpret the first and last respondent comments to pertain to the same concern. FmHA does not agree that a co-general
partner be exempt from these provisions since the loan was made to the entity and it is up to the entity to maintain its
financial integrity. The regulations already contain provisions for handling cases where the entity chooses to
transfer an obligation without monetary default. There would be no penalty in that case.

 One respondent suggests that the language be changed to allow interim lenders who are now making loans to only FmHA-financed
projects. Another suggested that the language be changed to state ``other than identity of interest companies.''
Another respondent felt that the record of providing financing to non-FmHA projects be on a national basis and not
limited to the State in which a particular loan is made. A respondent suggested that the language be changed to state
the lender be ``authorized'' to do business in a State since not all States require the lender to be licensed. Two respondents
suggested that FmHA provide the interim financing to eliminate the expense connected with outside interim financing.
Two other respondents voiced their objection to this section. Two respondents supported this section.

FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FmHA feels strongly that the borrower not provide its own interim financing. The interim lender is responsible for
inspecting each stage of construction. If borrowers are allowed to provide their own interim financing they, in essence,
would also be allowed to inspect their own construction. FmHA feels that inspections by arms-length third parties
will provide a more objective assessment of construction standards and quality. The language has been changed to
state that the lender be ``authorized'' to do business in a State rather than ``licensed.'' As long as interim financing
can be secured at reasonable rates, fees, and terms, FmHA does not feel that the wholesale use of Government funds for
interim financing is in keeping with the intent that local lenders be given the opportunity of furnishing the interim
financing.

 The only change being made to this section is to correspond to a recent wording change in FmHA's closing regulation.
The use of member attorneys by nonprofit groups has been allowed by the regulation for some time. FmHA does not consider
the relationship between a nonprofit borrower and its attorney in any way resembles the relationship between a profit-motivated
borrower and its attorney. The nonprofit attorney has no financial interest in the nonprofit whereas the reverse
can be true of the attorney who is a member of the limited profit.

 One respondent suggested that this section be amended to make clear that subsequent loans to existing borrowers for

affect developers who acquired land for a future second phase. Another respondent recommended that this section
show what types of paperwork are needed for a subsequent loan or that the information be contained in an exhibit to the
regulation. Two respondents expressed their opinion that the language which states that subsequent loans made on
or after December 15, 1989, cannot be prepaid is contrary to prior interpretations by the National Office. Another
person suggested that this section be revised to permit the addition of office, laundry, maintenance, or other community
space not be subject to rating and ranking. One respondent agreed with this section.

 This section states that subsequent loans to develop additional units must be rated and ranked. All other subsequent
loans which do not fall within this definition are excluded, including rehabilitation of existing FmHA-financed
units. It was always FmHA's intention that subsequent loans to develop additional units be subject to the rating system;
this section merely clarifies that intention. FmHA agrees that some guidance be added to the regulation which better
defines what types of paperwork are required for subsequent loans. The types of paperwork needed for subsequent loans
has been added to the regulation as Exhibit A&hyph;14. Prepayment is covered by proposed changes now being incorporated
in FmHA regulations. Office, laundry, maintenance, and other community space facilities are not considered living
units and do not fall under this definition.

 The respondent did not make known whether the reference to housing condition refers to the overall condition or to
the interior condition of the units. If the latter, we have deliberately not required this type of information since
it would be almost impossible for a market analyst to inspect the inside of the units. In the case of the overall exterior
condition of the property, FmHA feels this analysis is subject to the personal feelings of the analyst and would not
be based on any uniform means for ranking the physical condition. FmHA does require the analyst to give an opinion as
to the upkeep of the existing stock in accordance with Exhibit A&hyph;8, ``Outline of Professional Market Study.''

 There were many objections raised to this section that requires an audited financial statement. It was pointed out
that, even if individual financial statements could be audited, the cost for providing the original and updates during
the processing period would be prohibitive. These same individuals objected to providing a copy of their prior year
income tax return because it is deemed an invasion of privacy. One respondent pointed out the hardship this would create
for nonprofit applicants and proposed that they be able to provide their most recent audited statement. One respondent
supported this section but suggested that ``current'' be defined as the end of the company's last fiscal year and that
updates be unaudited. One respondent suggested that instead of requiring audited financial statements, a good review
of financial statements by FmHA personnel would ensure financial security. Several persons pointed out the fact
that most applicants are newly established organizations which have no financial record to audit. One respondent
representing a Certified Public Accounting firm stated that it is often impracticable to conduct an examination
of personal financial records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and to express an unqualified
opinion. That respondent recommended the section be changed to require that the personal financial statements either
be compiled or reviewed and stated that a detailed and complete underwriting of creditworthiness can be performed
on compiled or reviewed personal financial statements that are comprehensively prepared. Two respondents supported
this section.

 In light of the difficulty in obtaining audited financial statements of individuals, FmHA will continue with the
requirements currently in existence and has eliminated the word ``audited'' from this section. The Agency also feels
that a proper analysis of a financial statement will provide a better understanding of an applicant's creditworthiness
than would an individual's income tax statement. FmHA maintains the position that a financial statement not be more
than 6 months old when the preapplication is filed.

 One respondent recommended that FmHA establish a percentage of elderly homeowners that could be considered as potential
tenants. Two respondents disagreed with the use of a checklist in evaluating market studies. A few respondents disagreed
with limiting the area of consideration to 20 percent of the substandard rental units. Two respondents objected to
the use of professional market studies in the analysis of need and suggested that personal contact with possible tenants,
talking with other apartment owners, or conducting a newspaper questionnaire would provide a more credible means
for determining need. One respondent suggested that we include a definition of ``substandard units.'' Also, that
respondent pointed out that the same persons who reside in ``overcrowded'' units are being doublecounted, first
from the substandard category and second from the new households category. One respondent agreed with this section.

FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FmHA does not agree that elderly homeowners should be considered in the need for units. That is not to say these elderly
homeowners cannot live in the FmHA-financed unit. We do not feel that the general market can absorb the sale of multiple
homes at one time. Exhibit A&hyph;8 does state that if the economic conditions reflect normal selling times for homes
in the market area, then elderly homeowners may be considered as a secondary market. FmHA has had in use a checklist
for analyzing market studies for some time; this regulation now requires its use to enhance internal control over
administration of the program. The purpose of the checklist is to enable the reviewer to determine if all segments
of Exhibit A&hyph;8 have been addressed by the study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Market demand and feasibility is created by several factors. One of those factors is the demand created by persons
who are living in substandard units and seeking decent, safe and sanitary housing which can be financed by FmHA. Currently,
there is no limit on the percentage of substandard units which an analyst can project in determining market demand.
For example, if there are 100 units of substandard housing in a given market, analysts can and have stated that 80, or
any other arbitrary, percentage of the families living in these units create a portion of the demand. We have found
that the percentage of units projected as a result of substandard housing varies significantly from study to study.
In addition, without any boundaries, it provides the market analyst with a contingency to justify demand. The 20 percent
limitation was offered based upon previous experience with market analysis. Without a threshold, FmHA is defenseless
in challenging a professional market analyst. It is reasonable to set a limit since there is no objective methodology
in which to actually determine how many people residing in substandard units will move to a newly completed Section
515 complex. The Agency will, however, allow a higher number if the analyst can clearly document that the occupants
of more than 20 percent of the occupied substandard rental units are willing and able to relocate to the proposed housing.
The documentation will be in the form of signed survey sheets prepared expressly to capture such information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of market studies does not prohibit anyone from doing more to assess the market, such as making local contacts.
Placing a questionnaire in a newspaper does not ensure the return of any responses. A definition of substandard has
been added.

FmHA feels it necessary to standardize the way need is calculated in order to provide some uniformity in market studies.
The revised Exhibit A&hyph;8 outlines the sources of demand which will be accepted by the Agency. There was a discrepancy
between this section and the Exhibit A&hyph;8 language in delineating sources of need. This section of the regulation
has been changed to agree with the language of Exhibit A&hyph;8.

 Feasibility must be determined during the preapplication stage and the ranges of local incomes must be established

 One respondent objected to applicants who publicly bid their projects having to submit a Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13.
One respondent felt that requesting this much detail information at the preapplication stage would not prove useful
since cost estimates change markedly between preapplication and application. One respondent supported this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FmHA's new cost tracking system will track the trade item costs of each project. The Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13 provides
a breakdown of trade item costs which will readily facilitate the use of the cost tracking system. Otherwise, the value
of the tracking system will be diminished, thus not allowing the Agency to establish cost data comparisons. Persons
submitting bids must have prepared extensive cost estimates in preparing the bid. Therefore, we do not feel this will
cause an undue burden on the contractor.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One respondent suggested that a definition of substandard be included. One respondent asked if FmHA intends to prepare
and distribute special tabulations of substandard units by its definition, by occupancy, tenure, income, and household
size. Several respondents expressed objection to FmHA not considering elderly homeowners as a basis of need. Several
respondents objected to the 20 percent ceiling on substandard units which FmHA will accept in the determination of
need. One respondent raised the question of who is responsible for determining if the analyst is qualified and what
the qualifications are for preparing a study. That person also wanted to know if the study is incomplete, is the preapplication
determined incomplete and returned to the applicant. Two respondents felt that requiring the market analyst to make
an on-site visit was a significant improvement in this exhibit. One respondent suggested that the exhibit be used
as a guide only and not mandated. One respondent asked if FmHA intended to exclude rentoverburden households from
rentup demand estimates. That respondent also expressed an opinion that the listing of small businesses in the Site
section of the exhibit would be construed to mean those businesses must be available in order for a community to be considered
eligible for FmHA financing. Other comments and suggestions offered on the technical content of the exhibit are too
numerous to list here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FmHA response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A definition for substandard has been included. HUD furnished FmHA with information pertaining to occupancy in substandard
units based on the 1980 census. That information was disseminated to our field staff for distribution to market analysts.
We are in the process of coordinating with HUD to obtain this same data when it becomes available. (See discussion of
elderly homeowners under Exhibit A&hyph;7, Paragraph II.A. and a discussion of substandard housing under Exhibit
A&hyph;7, Paragraph II.A). The qualifications of a market analyst and the responsibility for determining whether
an analyst is qualified are iterated in Exhibit A&hyph;7 of this instruction. If a market study is incomplete, the
applicant may furnish additional information to complement the market study without the necessity of returning
the entire preapplication. This will inevitably delay the processing of the preapplication. The requirement that
a market analyst visit the site of the proposed project was not introduced with this revision; it has always been a requirement.
The purpose of the exhibit is to require enough information on which a feasibility decision can be based and to establish
uniformity in the content of studies. Prior to FmHA issuing the exhibit, the market studies varied greatly and all
did not contain the most basic types of information. We have seen a marked improvement in the studies because of the
issuance of the exhibit. While FmHA originally allowed applicants to consider the exhibit as a guideline, we did not
feel it prudent to continue this practice. The exhibit is, therefore, required in order for the study to be acceptable
to the Agency; market studies which do not contain Exhibit A&hyph;8 requirements will not be acceptable. We understand
that the HUD information on rentoverburdened households is not yet available. In the interim, language has been added
to the exhibit which invites the analyst to include this type of information where available. While this exhibit is
not the proper vehicle for establishing policies concerning required community services and facilities, the Site
section has been reworded to state that the businesses listed are an example of the types of business which may be located
in the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the proposed changes are based on comments and recommendations submitted from market analysts over the past
two years. Market analysts have expressed differing opinions concerning the content of this exhibit. We have considered
all of these differing opinions and have amended the exhibit to include what we consider a rational and understandable
basis for a market study. We have attempted to correct the original exhibit requirements where it lacked sufficient
statistics to make a determination for elderly and congregate projects. Other changes made to the exhibit will standardize
the types of information market studies will contain and provide the uniformity heretofore missing. We have considered
all comments and the exhibit now reflects those changes which FmHA has determined appropriate for inclusion.

In any case where the loan approval official feels it appropriate, and prior to the award or approval of any contract
in which there is an identity of interest as defined in &sect;1924.4 (i) of this subpart, the contractor and any subcontractor,
material supplier or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest must provide the applicant and FmHA with a trade-item
cost breakdown of the proposed contract amount for evaluation. The cost of any surety as required by &sect;1944.222
(h) and (i) of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter and &sect;1924.6 (a)(3) of this subpart, or cost certification
as required by paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section, will be included in the proposed contract amount and shown under
General Requirements on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13, which is available in all FmHA offices. FmHA personnel will be responsible
for reviewing the estimates on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13 to determine if the dollar amounts total correctly, to assure
that costs are categorized under their appropriate columns, and to confirm that the estimated costs for all line items
are reasonable and customary for the State.

Whenever the State Director determines it appropriate, and in all situations where there is an identity of interest
as defined in &sect;1924.4 (i) of this subpart, the borrower, contractor and any subcontractor, material supplier,
or equipment lessor having an identity of interest must each provide certification using Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13
as to the actual cost of the work performed in connection with the construction contract. The construction costs,
as reported on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13, must also be audited, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, by
a CPA, or LPA licensed on or before December 31, 1970. In addition, certain agreed upon procedures (available in any
FmHA office) will be performed in accordance with Attestation Standards. In some cases, FmHA will contract directly
with a CPA or LPA for the cost certification. In that event, documentation necessary to have the costs of construction
certified by an FmHA contractor that they were the actual costs of the work performed, as reported on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13,
will be provided. Funds which were included in the loan for cost certification and which are ultimately not needed
because FmHA contracts for the cost certification will be returned on the loan. FmHA personnel will utilize Exhibit
M of this subpart (available in any FmHA office) and Form FmHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1924&hyph;26, ``Cost Certification Worksheet,'' to assist in the evaluation of the cost certification process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Prior to the start of construction, the borrower, contractor and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment
lessor sharing an identity of interest must submit, to the CPA or LPA, the accounting system that the borrower, contractor,
subcontractor, material supplier or equipment lessor and/or the CPA or LPA proposes to set up and use in maintaining
a running record of the actual cost. In order to be acceptable, the borrower must provide a written assertion that it
has an accounting system that is suitably designed to provide for a trade-item basis comparison of the actual cost
as compared to the estimated cost submitted on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13. Costs pertaining to a specific line item will
be set up in the accounting system for that particular account. For instance, only costs of materials, supplies, equipment,
and labor associated with concrete will be shown in the concrete account. The accounting system must also restrict
costs to those pertaining to a specific project so that costs from multiple projects will not be co-mingled. The independent
CPA or LPA shall report on the borrower's assertion in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The borrower's and the CPA or LPA's reports on
the accounting system shall be provided to FmHA by the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Prior to final payment to anyone required to cost certify, a trade-item breakdown showing the actual cost compared
to the estimated cost must be provided to the owner and FmHA. Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13 is the form of comparative breakdown
that must be used, and contains the certifications required of the applicant and contractor prior to final payment.
The amounts for builder's general overhead, builder's profit, and general requirements, respectively, shall not
exceed the amounts represented on the estimate of cost breakdown provided in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iv)
of this section for any contractor, subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor having or sharing an identity
of interest with the borrower. The amounts for general overhead, builder's profit, and general requirements must
be established prior to FmHA approving the construction contract and will not be changed during the course of construction.
This applies to all contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, or equipment lessors having or sharing an
identity of interest with the applicant. Contract change orders will be processed to adjust the contract amount downward
prior to the final payment to the contractor, if necessary, to assure that the amounts shown in the certificate of actual
costs do not exceed the amounts represented in the contract cost breakdown. Reduction in the builder's profit, and
general overhead if needed, will counterbalance any increase reflected in the contract costs. Any funds remaining
as a result of hard cost savings will be applied to the account as an extra payment or used for eligible loan purposes
approved by FmHA as long as the improvements are genuinely needed and will enhance marketability of the project. All
increases or decreases of 15 percent or more in line item costs will require documentation as to the reason for the increases
and/or decreases. The State Director may require documentation for increases and/or decreases of less than 15 percent,
if he/she determines it necessary. This information will be required with the cost certification.

(C) The CPA or LPA audit, performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, will include such tests of the
accounting records and such other auditing procedures of the borrower and the contractor (and any subcontractor,
material supplier or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services
rendered, and materials supplied in accordance with the construction contract he/she considers necessary to express
an opinion on the construction costs as reported on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13. The CPA or LPA shall also perform the additional
agreed upon procedures specified by FmHA (available in any FmHA office), performed in accordance with Attestation
Standards, for the applicant and the contractor (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor
sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in accordance
with the construction contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Upon completion of construction and prior to final payment, the CPA or LPA will provide an opinion concerning whether
the construction costs, as reported on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13, present fairly the costs of construction in conformity
with eligible construction costs as prescribed in FmHA regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) In some cases, cost certification will be obtained by FmHA through direct contract with the CPA or LPA. The borrower
and his/her CPA or LPA will cooperate fully with the contract CPA or LPA by providing all documentation necessary to
conduct the certification. FmHA reserves the right to determine, upon receipt of the certified Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13
and the auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to FmHA. If not satisfactory to FmHA, the borrower will be
responsible for providing additional information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) There will exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA and the borrower except for the performance of
the examination of the cost certification, accounting systems work, and tax preparation. Any CPA or LPA who acts as
the borrower's accountant (performing manual or automated bookkeeping services or maintains the official accounting
records) will not be the same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(G) Forms FmHA 1944&hyph;30, ``Identity of Interest (IOI) Disclosure Certificate'' and FmHA 1944&hyph;31, ``Identity
of Interest (IOI) Qualification Form,'' provide written notification to the borrower that willful and intentional
falsification of cost certification documents will result in debarment of all violators in accordance with the provisions
of FmHA Instruction 1940&hyph;M (available in any FmHA office). These forms require the disclosure of all identities
of interest associated with project construction, certify the entity's ability to provide the contracted service,
and cite the penalties for failure to disclose or falsify such certification. Each applicant/borrower will be required
to complete and sign the forms (available in any FmHA office).

``Actual construction'' means ``work'' as defined in American Institute of Architects (AIA) documents: ``*&blank;*&blank;*
labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's obligations.''
Under this definition, contractors who choose to subcontract out construction of the project to another contractor
will not obtain a builder's fee (general overhead and profit) when:

(I) Qualified contracting entities. Contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and any other individual
or organization sharing an identity of interest and providing materials or services for the project must certify
that it is a viable, ongoing trade or business qualified and properly licensed to undertake the work for which it intends
to contract. Form FmHA 1944&hyph;31 will be prepared and executed by the contracting entities. The form provides
notification to the entities of the penalty, under law, for erroneously certifying to the statements contained therein.
Debarment actions will be instituted against entities who fail to disclose an identity of interest in accordance
with the provisions of FmHA Instruction 1940&hyph;M (available in any FmHA office).

and any contingent liabilities that may exist. FmHA personnel will be responsible for analyzing the financial statement
as to the sufficiency of the owner-builder's financial capability to carry out construction. The financial strength
must demonstrate the ability of the owner-builder to pay all bills prior to receiving periodic draws of funds from
the lender.

(G) A current, dated, and signed trade-item cost breakdown of the estimated total development cost of the project
which has been prepared by the applicant/owner-builder. Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13 will be used for this purpose. If
cost certification services are required by FmHA, the cost of such services may be included in the total development
cost of the project. Any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest with
the applicant/owner-builder as defined in &sect;1924.4(i) of this subpart must also provide a trade-item cost breakdown
of the proposed amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) Prior to the start of construction, the owner-builder and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment
lessor sharing an identity of interest must submit, to the CPA or LPA, the accounting system that the owner-builder,
subcontractor, material supplier or equipment lessor and/or the CPA or LPA proposes to set up and use in maintaining
a running record of the actual cost. In order to be acceptable, the owner-builder must provide a written assertion
that it has an accounting system that is suitably designed to provide for a trade-item basis comparison of the actual
cost as compared to the estimated cost submitted on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13. Costs pertaining to a specific line item
will be set up in the accounting system for that particular account. For instance, only costs of materials, supplies,
equipment, and labor associated with concrete will be shown in the concrete account. The accounting system must also
restrict costs to those pertaining to a specific project so that costs from multiple projects will not be co-mingled.
The independent CPA or LPA shall report on the owner-builder's assertion in accordance with the Standards for Attestation
Engagements of the AICPA. The owner-builder's and the CPA or LPA's reports on the accounting system shall be provided
to FmHA by the owner-builder.

(iv) The development cost of the project may include a typical allowance for general overhead, general requirements
and a builder's profit. These amounts may be determined by local investigation and also from HUD data for the area.
The applicant/owner-builder and any subcontractors, material suppliers and equipment lessors having or sharing
an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder may not be permitted a builder's profit, general overhead,
and general requirements which exceed the amounts represented on their cost breakdown.

or officers, directly or indirectly, any profits from the construction of the project except a typical builder's
fee for performing the services that would normally be performed by a general contractor under the contract method
of construction. Discounts and rebates given the owner-builder in advance must be deducted before the invoices are
paid. If discounts or rebates are given after the invoices are paid, the funds must be returned to the supervised bank
account or applied on the interim construction loan, as appropriate. Under no circumstances will the dollar amount
be placed in the reserve account.

(viii) The applicant/owner-builder and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity
of interest as defined in &sect;1924.4(i) of this subpart must each provide certification as to the actual cost of
the work performed in connection with the construction of the project on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13 prior to final payment.
The construction costs, as reported on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13, must be audited by a CPA, or LPA licensed on or before
December 31, 1970, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, and certain agreed upon procedures (available
in any FmHA office) performed in accordance with Attestation Standards. In some cases, FmHA will contract directly
with a CPA or LPA for the cost certification. In that event, documentation necessary to have the costs of construction
certified by an FmHA contractor that they were the actual costs of the work performed, as reported on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13,
will be provided. Funds which were included in the loan for cost certification and which are ultimately not needed
because FmHA contracts for the cost certification will be returned on the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The CPA or LPA's audit, performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, will include such tests of
the accounting records and such other auditing procedures of the applicant/owner-builder (and any subcontractor,
material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services
rendered, and materials supplied in connection with the construction of the project he/she considers necessary
to express an opinion on the construction costs as reported on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13. Upon completion of construction
and prior to final payment, the CPA or LPA will provide an opinion as to whether the construction costs as reported on
Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13 present fairly the costs of construction in conformity with eligible construction costs
as prescribed in FmHA regulations. FmHA reserves the right to determine, upon receipt of the certified Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13
and the auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to FmHA. At a minimum, the CPA or LPA shall also perform any
additional agreed upon procedures (available in any FmHA office) specified by FmHA, performed in accordance with
Attestation Standards, of the owner-builder (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing
an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in connection
with the construction. There will exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA and the borrower except for
the performance of the examination of the cost certification, accounting systems work, and tax preparation. Any
CPA or LPA who acts as the borrower's accountant (performing manual or automated bookkeeping services or maintains
the official accounting records) will not be the same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Prior to final payment to anyone required to cost certify, FmHA must be provided with a certification and a trade-item
breakdown showing the actual cost compared to the estimated cost furnished in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(G)
of this section. Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13 is the form of comparative breakdown that must be used, and contains the certification
required of the applicant/owner-builder prior to final payment. The amounts for builder's general overhead, general
requirements, and builder's profit shall not exceed the amounts represented on the estimate of cost breakdown provided
in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(G) of this section for the owner-builder or any subcontractor, material
supplier, or equipment lessor having or sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder. Final
payment to the owner-builder will be adjusted, if necessary, to assure that the amounts shown on the certificate of
actual cost do not exceed the amounts represented on the cost breakdown. Any funds remaining as a result of hard cost
savings will be applied to the account as an extra payment or used for eligible loan purposes approved by FmHA as long
as the improvements are genuinely needed and will enhance marketability of the project. All increases or decreases
of 15 percent or more in line item costs will require documentation as to the reason for the increases or decreases.
The State Director may require documentation for increases or decreases of less than 15 percent, if he/she determines
it necessary. This information will be required with the cost certification.

 When an applicant files a preapplication for a loan, the servicing official will advise the applicant not to start
construction or incur any indebtedness until the loan is closed, except for those cases involving interim financing;
the guidelines outlined in &sect;1944.235(c)(1) of this subpart will then apply. During the period of preapplication
review and processing, applicants will not take any actions with respect to their applications which would have an
adverse impact on the environment or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. This requirement does not preclude
the applicant from developing preliminary plans or designs or performing other work necessary to support an application
for Federal, State, or local permits or assistance. If the applicant incurs debts for work, materials, land purchase,
or other authorized fees and charges before the loan is closed, the State Director may authorize the use of loan funds
to pay the debts when all of the following conditions exist and debts were authorized in writing by FmHA prior to their
being incurred (market studies will be exempt from this requirement):

of an emergency, the requirement that the cost be approved by FmHA in writing before the expense is incurred is waived
as long as the servicing official is notified by the next working day.) Such costs are:

Cost containment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To achieve affordable rents and occupancy rates (not considering rental assistance or similar subsidies), all development
costs will be economical in nature and not include costs for unnecessary or elaborate design features. Cost containment
is not to be interpreted as accepting poor design or cheap construction. Projects must provide the features and amenities
necessary for the lifestyles of the tenants and members. Consideration must be given to the cost/benefit ratio when
evaluating, recommending, or requiring specific design features or construction techniques. Life cycle cost analysis
will be employed to determine the types of materials which will reduce operation/maintenance costs even though their
initial costs are higher. Operation and maintenance costs factored into proposed operating budgets will be adjusted
accordingly. The following guidelines are to be followed when developing projects:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Each State architect/engineer (A/E) will compile and maintain data on costs of all projects. Total project estimates
will be compared with estimates available through the Marshall &amp; Swift computer program. These estimates, along
with the line item costs recorded in FmHA's Automated Multi-Housing Accounting System (AMAS) cost tracking system,
will be used to establish a benchmark for future project costs. Any proposal that exceeds these costs must be carefully
evaluated for possible cost reductions. The borrower will be responsible for resolving the differences in cost to
bring the project into line with the lesser of the cost tracking system or Marshall &amp; Swift estimates. Final determinations
must be realistic, interrelated to maintenance and operation costs, and based upon local conditions and common sense.
The State will consider circumstances such as high land costs, remote rural areas, etc., which could present a problem
in achieving such an alignment of costs. The AMAS cost tracking system will be used to record both estimates and actual
line item costs. At the time the preapplication estimates are being examined by FmHA, the percentages for builder's
profit, general overhead, and general requirements will be calculated to determine if they are within the allowable
percentages established in this paragraph. They will again be calculated at the time the final estimates are submitted
to FmHA. Estimated amounts in excess of the allowable percentages will be reduced to the appropriate percentage.
Once the final estimates are approved by FmHA, payment of builder's profit, general overhead, and general requirements
will not exceed the estimated amounts. Allowable percentages for builder's profit, general overhead, and general
requirements will not exceed 10 percent, 4 percent, and 7 percent, respectively. This will not be interpreted to mean
that, if historical percentages for these costs were below 10, 4, and 7, respectively, FmHA will allow the costs to
be increased automatically. Adequate justification and documentation will be required to approve an increase to
10, 4, or 7 percent for cases where any of the costs were previously below those levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The elimination or reduction of unnecessary delays in application processing can contribute to cost containment
through lower interest and other business expenses on land, inventory, tests, design studies, etc. When reasonable
processing timeframes are established, known and followed, appropriate time can be planned for preparing quality
application and construction documents. This can result in better instructions to the builder, fewer errors and
lower construction costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Most materials and systems are available in a range of qualities and prices. The construction documents will be
carefully reviewed for specifications that require qualities or grades higher than necessary. These specifications
will be accepted only if fully justified and no reasonable alternatives are available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Designs which employ standard building material dimensions and reduce waste will be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Sites will require a minimum amount of site development work. The State Director may authorize a site requiring
higher than normal site development costs only if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The proposed site and site development costs are less than the cost of the normal site and site development costs;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There are no other sites available in the market area with a lower combined cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) All project site densities (units per acre) will be within the following ranges, regardless of site conditions
unless local zoning requirements dictate otherwise:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) For example: A 24-unit project composed of two-story buildings must have a site of at least 1.3 acres. FmHA will
finance the purchase and development of larger sites, but not more than 1.7 acres. Ranges for projects with a mixture
of building heights can be interpolated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An exception may be made to this provision only if the site in question is the only site available in the market area
and its size, shape, or condition makes a portion of the site unsuitable for building. An exception to this requirement
must be granted by the State Director or a designee. The applicant must provide written documentation that no other
sites are available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Sound judgment and common sense must also be used in construction inspections and final acceptance of projects.
Field staff involved in these activities must be careful not to impose additional or unreasonable requirements on
the builder that will increase construction costs. States should consider hiring enough construction inspectors
to provide more than the required inspections and to allow multiple unscheduled and unannounced visits. The State
Office may also, with National Office authorization, contract for inspection services to deter deviations from
the FmHA-accepted construction documents. Prefinal and final inspections must be conducted by qualified FmHA personnel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Buildings will not include numerous wall and roof breaks, unusual designs requiring excessive corners and foundation
off-sets, or that require more exterior entrances than absolutely necessary. Designs will not be considered acceptable
that place dining facilities in structures attached to the main building when these amenities can be less expensively
included within the main structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Buildings will not include roof slopes less than 3/12 nor greater than 6/12 unless otherwise required by local
authorities or in order to accommodate severe weather conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The use of repeat designs will be required from applicants whose architects have designed projects previously
approved by FmHA. This does not mean ``cloned'' projects are required throughout the State and/or region. When a repeat
design is being used in the same community, the exterior facade (such as color, siding material, etc.) must be noticeably
changed except in the case of subsequent phases. The State Office architect will ensure that sufficient differences
are included in the proposed plans which will preclude the appearance of ``cloned'' designs. ``Predesigned'' buildings
must fit the basic existing contours of the proposed site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The following facilities are considered nonessential and will not be included in the loan unless required by
local codes or ordinances:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Swimming pools.

the unit (except unfinished storage space for outdoor items and space needed for heating and/or cooling equipment)
and measured from the exterior surface of the framing of exterior walls and the center line of interior party or corridor
walls. States should establish ranges within these dimensions to be commensurate with unit sizes in the local market.
For example, when conventional units in the market are at the low end of FmHA's range scale, FmHA will also build a comparably
smaller unit.

(i) An additional 100 to 120 square feet of living area may be added to the 4-bedroom unit guideline for each bedroom
in excess of four. Floor areas for living and dining rooms should comply with Guide 2 of subpart A of part 1924 of this
chapter (available in any FmHA office). The maximum square footage in congregate housing units will not exceed 110
percent of the minimum square footages listed above.

 The loan resolution or loan agreement contains provisions of policy and procedure which should be carefully read,
fully understood by the applicant, and executed by the applicant prior to loan approval. If any provisions are not
appropriate to a particular case, proposed substitute language must be approved by FmHA and OGC. Subpart C of part
1930 of this chapter provides for the maintenance of certain accounts and the pledge of housing income as security.
It contains regulatory provisions governing and giving FmHA power to impose requirements regarding the housing
and related operations of the applicant. All sections and requirements determined applicable by OGC will form part
of any other loan resolution or agreement that may be submitted by the applicant. These are:

(3) Feasibility for projects receiving tax credits will require a more extensive examination since tax credits are
predicated on renting to very-low income persons. Applicants choosing to apply for tax credits will be responsible
for identifying the amount of tax credits it anticipates requesting from the State, as well as the income percentage
on which the credits will be based, and the percentage of units targeted for tax credit eligible persons. The market
study must substantiate the presence of persons whose incomes would qualify for tax credits who cannot afford the
basic rent and those persons whose incomes are tax credit eligible but who are still able to afford the basic rent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After rating the preapplication, if the priority processing point score is sufficient to potentially authorize
issuance of an AD&hyph;622 inviting a formal application within the next 24 months (except for RCH preapplications),
the servicing official will review the proposal to determine eligibility, feasibility, and compliance with loan
purposes, policies, and regulations. Eligibility/feasibility reviews will be completed in priority point score
order. Where a tie in priority point score exists, the order of review will be determined in accordance with paragraph
(c)(5) of this section. In cases where the market study is incomplete or not in accordance with Exhibit A&hyph;8 of
this subpart, applicants will be required to have the study supplemented to agree with FmHA requirements. The time
involved in supplementing the market study will cause the preapplication to be delayed in determining feasibility.

(2) In those cases where the need for new rental units is questioned by the servicing official, another market study
may be obtained by the servicing office at its discretion through contract with a market analyst. The same market analyst
who provided an assessment for the applicant will not be used. Issuance of all AD&hyph;622s in that market area will
be delayed until the FmHA market study has been completed and its contents reviewed by FmHA.

Interim financing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the amount of the loan exceeds $50,000, the applicant may obtain interim financing from commercial or public
sources for the construction period if it can be obtained at reasonable interest rates, fees, and terms, and in the
best financial interests of the Government. Interim financing will be obtained to preclude the necessity for multiple
advances of FmHA funds. The interim lender must be authorized to operate in the State in which the project will be located
and must have an established record of providing financing to entities other than FmHA-financed projects. Since
the interim lender is responsible for inspecting construction along with FmHA, the borrowing entity (including
any of its identity of interest entities) cannot provide interim financing to its own project. Interim financing
will be used subject to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

* * * * * 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(viii) Because interest rates can fluctuate between the time construction estimates are finalized and completion
of construction, any excess funds remaining from interim financing will be returned on the FmHA loan. Also, interim
funds remaining because of early completion of construction will be returned. The leftover interest may be used for
certain other eligible loan purposes critical to the completion of the project which were unknown to the applicant
and contractor at the time the loan was approved, provided prior National Office concurrence is obtained.

(a) A subsequent loan is made to an applicant/borrower to complete, improve, repair, and/or make modifications to
the project initially financed by FmHA, or for equity and/or other purposes when authorized by the provisions of subpart
E of part 1965 of this chapter to avert prepayment. A subsequent loan to develop additional units must be rated and ranked
in accordance with the priority point system contained in &sect;1944.231 of this subpart. Other subsequent loan
requests do not have to compete for funding under the priority point system.

A. Economic justification and project size should be based on the housing need and demand from eligible prospective
tenants or members who are permanent residents of the community and its surrounding trade area. Since the intent of
the program is to provide adequate housing for the eligible permanent residents of the community, temporary residents
of a community (such as college students in a college town, military personnel stationed at a military installation
within the trade area, or others not claiming their current residence as their legal domicile) should be discounted
in determining need and project size. The market study will reflect the types and sizes of units which are needed in
the market area. For example, if the full market analysis shows a need for one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom,
and four-bedroom units, the preapplication must contain a percentage of three- and four-bedroom units to correspond
to the need expressed by the market study in order to accommodate the larger families. The need will not be based on persons
who own their own homes but will be derived from: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Persons migrating into the area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Persons dwelling in family units who desire to move into their own units (elderly persons living with family members
will only be considered if evidence of their interest in moving into the project is furnished with the market study);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Conservative estimate (not to exceed 20 percent) of households living in substandard rental housing (lacking
complete plumbing facilities or 1.01 or more persons per room). (A higher percentage will be allowed only if it can
be clearly documented by signed survey sheets, developed expressly for this purpose, that occupants of more than
20 percent of the occupied substandard rental units are willing and able to move into the proposed project.); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Demolition of rental stock; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Allowance for a 5 percent vacancy rate in the growth of households since the last census; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Conservative estimate (not to exceed 20 percent) of households experiencing rent overburden provided the analyst
has made a determination there are sufficient households in the market area to occupy any rental units vacated by those
lower income persons who choose to move into the proposed project from the existing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. A detailed study based upon data obtained from census reports, State or county data centers, individual employers,
industrial directories, or chambers of commerce is required. FmHA personnel will utilize the market study checklist
found at Exhibit A&hyph;12 of this subpart (available in any FmHA office) as a means for measuring market study credibility.
The study will include:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Exhibit A&hyph;8 of this subpart outlines the information which professional rental market studies will be required
to follow. The qualifications of the person preparing the market study should include some housing or demographic
experience. The market study will be used by FmHA in evaluating market feasibility but will not be the sole factor in
such a determination. The data and information provided in the market study will be used to supplement FmHA's knowledge
of the market area and to facilitate rational judgment concerning the need for new rental units. Other considerations
will be FmHA's experience with the housing market in the State and local area and U. S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development's (HUD's) analysis of market feasibility for the proposed units.

result in denial of further participation in the section 515 program by the analyst.

J. Identification of the amount of tax credit units anticipated to be requested from the State Agency, the income percentage
on which the credits will be based, and the percentage of project units targeted for tax credit eligible persons. This
information is needed to determine the levels of incomes in the market area which will support the basic rents while
also qualifying the borrower for tax credits.

will be prepared and submitted by all applicants. In addition to completing the individual line items, the cost of
items such as rights-of-way, equipment, and utility connections must be included and identified with the Form FmHA
1924&hyph;13. Off-site improvements and the method of prorating the cost between eligible and noneligible loan
items must be provided with the Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13. The cost breakdown must also separately show items not included
in the loan, such as furnishings, equipment, and the noneligible off-site improvements. The trade item cost breakdowns
must be updated just prior to loan approval.

Market studies which do not address all segments of this outline will not be considered acceptable and may adversely
affect the processing of preapplications. Preapplications with unacceptable market studies may be returned, deferred,
or rejected, as determined appropriate by the servicing office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following information is to be used by analysts in the preparation of market studies for the Section 515 housing
program. It generally contains the type and depth of information which Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) requires
for evaluating the feasibility of prospective housing developments. The analyst will be expected to provide sufficient
quantitative data (such as census tables), primary data (such as survey of existing comparables), and qualitative
data (such as local contacts in the community) to support the conclusions reached. The analyst may present any other
discussions and/or data which will help support the complete analysis of the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The outline provides for the demonstration of historical trends and allows the analyst to project into the 2 years
beyond the last actual year of record. Additional guidance is offered in individual segments of the outline. You will
need to provide a statement of your experience and why you think you are qualified to prepare such a study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determination of need and demand will be derived for prospective rental tenants only from: (1) Persons migrating
into the area, (2) persons dwelling in family units who desire to move into their own units (elderly living with family
members will only be considered if evidence of their interest in moving into the project is furnished with the market
study), (3) conservative estimate (not to exceed 20 percent) of households living in substandard rental housing,
(4) demolition of rental stock, (5) allowance for a 5 percent vacancy rate, and (6) conservative estimate (not to exceed
20 percent) of households experiencing rent overburden provided the analyst has made a determination there are sufficient
households in the market area to occupy any rental units vacated by those lower income persons who choose to move into
the proposed project from the existing units. Substandard is defined as (1) Units lacking complete plumbing and (2)
overcrowded (1.01 or more persons per room).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
For proposed congregate projects, the analyst will be responsible for researching the current need for, and usage
of, services in the market area. The types of services being used, the provider of the services, and their location
will be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Homeowners will not be included in the determination of need and demand for rental units.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The analyst will discuss the current market for single family houses and how sales, or the lack of, will affect the demand
for elderly rental units. If the economic conditions reflect a trend toward normal selling times for houses in the
market area, then the discussion should point to how elderly homeowners may reinforce the need, but only as a secondary
market and not as the primary market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A statement, with signature, certifying that the analyst (including an individual under contract to the analyst's
company) actually traveled to and physically surveyed the community where the proposed project will be located is
also required.

I. Market Area_General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The market area will be the community where the project will be located and only those outlying rural areas which will
be impacted by the project (excluding all other established communities). Except in specific cases of congregate
housing projects where an expanded market may be justified, the market area will not include the entire county (or
parish, township, or other subdivision). Any deviation from this definition must be coordinated with the servicing
office. The market area must be realistic. The criteria for selection should be described by the analyst. A map showing
the market area will be required. The following is an example of a market area description: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Based on an analysis of population and housing development patterns, major employers and commuting patterns,
the effective market area for the subject proposal is defined to include all of (Name), 35 percent of (Name) and 25 percent
of (Name) census divisions. This area is shown on Map 2 following Table 4 (page 11) in Section II of this report. In 1980,
this geographic market area contained an estimated 6,350 persons (6.1 percent of the county total of 103,829 persons).
During the 1970's decade, the overall market area experienced growth of 1,253 persons (representing 13.5 percent
of total gains in the county). In 1990, the (Name) market area population of 7,603 represented 6.7 percent of the county
population of 113,086. (See Table 4 and Map 2 in Section II for details.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The effective market area for the subject proposal includes the town of (Name) and a portion of the unincorporated
areas to the east and south. The (Name) River forms a natural barrier restricting development to the west. Housing
development and population growth have occurred along major transportation corridors, particularly Interstate
81 and U.S. 11 between (Name) and (Name). Secondary growth has occurred along State Roads 63 and 68 to the northwest
and southeast of (Name). The Interstate Industrial Park, with 16 employers providing 999 jobs, is centrally located
within the market area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This section will contain a full description of the site, its position in the community and location with respect to
residential support services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The proposed site is located in the eastern section of (Town) on (Major Thoroughfare). The area surrounding the
site is predominantly comprised of modest single family dwellings. The terrain is gently sloped, with grass, oak
trees, and some shrubs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The site is currently zoned for commercial business and is currently owned by a local car dealer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The site is approximately .3 mile east of the heart of town which contains a grocery store, drugstore, restaurants,
banking facilities, the post office, and town hall. Other shopping is available .2 mile south at (Town) Plaza. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. The medical clinic, which provides services of an osteopath, X-ray technician, a physician's assistant, and a
nurse, is approximately .8 mile north of this site. This clinic is open daily and also provides 24-hour emergency service.
The nearest hospitals are (Large Town) and (Town).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Photographs of the site are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. Communities suitable for multi-family projects may have certain smaller businesses necessary for the day-to-day
living convenience of the tenants and to supplement the employment base. For example, these may include, but not be
limited to, pharmacy, restaurants and fast food establishments, grocery and department stores, hardware and sundries,
etc. A representative number of these businesses are to be listed (by name) and location with respect to the proposed
site.

within the town and market area, the product or service offered by each employer, location of employer, and year each
employer was established are types of data FmHA will need to evaluate. It is also important to know if the larger employers
intend to increase or decrease number of employees in the immediate future or if there have been any significant recent
changes in number of employees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A breakdown by town, market area, and county for last 2 census years, a current year estimate and a projection to the
year the housing would be built (24 months) will have to be illustrated so that household formations can be tracked.
This data will tell us what portion of a housing demand is being created by an increase in numbers of new households.

 This section is one of the more important aspects of the market analysis. This information will enable FmHA to more
closely pinpoint the number of households which would comprise the target group of its evaluation. If the projected
percentage of renters exceeds the historic percentage of renters, the analyst will have to explain why there is an
increase. The information will be provided for town, market area, and county.

Households by income group. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
With the advent of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), we have found that more emphasis must be placed on analyzing
persons whose incomes qualify for LIHTC. This means families who earn 60 percent or less of the median income as established
by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Therefore, feasibility for projects expecting to
receive tax credits will also be based on the incomes required to support the tax credits. This could mean a level of
incomes either slightly lower or higher than FmHA very low-incomes. For those tax credit units occupied by low-income
families, the monthly gross rent cannot exceed 30 percent of the family income. Gross rent includes utilities, but
excludes payments of rental assistance by Federal, State, and local entities. The applicant will be responsible
for notifying FmHA and the market analyst of the amount of tax credits being requested, the income percentage on which
the credits will be based, and the percentage of project units targeted for tax credit eligible persons. In those cases
where less than 100 percent of the units will be designated for tax credit eligible persons, the incomes needed to support
the non-LIHTC units will need to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed. Income data will be shown for total and renter households. This information will be presented as follows:
(It is recommended that decile distribution of incomes be obtained from HUD. Other sources are acceptable and must
be identified.)

Housing stock.

The study must include the number of units within the town and county (where available), both single family and multi-family,
the number of mobile homes by tenure, along with the number of substandard units by tenure, based on the most recent
census data. Occasionally, a situation will exist within a community where a number of detached single family homes
are standing vacant. How this condition may affect the rental market must be evaluated and discussed.

Existing rental housing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The analyst must determine where the proposed project will fit into the present housing stock. To accomplish this,
the analyst will survey the existing units and will discuss how they (a) would be comparable with the proposed project
in overall appeal; (b) are less than desirable because of the age factor or upkeep; (c) are inconveniently located;
(d) do not provide the appropriate bedroom mix for the community need, etc.

Details of existing stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Additional narrative which describes the rental stock and provides tenant characteristics may be included. The
survey will include both subsidized and nonsubsidized rentals. In those communities containing too many rental
properties to list, all subsidized and a representative number of conventional projects will be included. Those
conventional projects which have rent levels comparable to the proposed project will be listed. Because elderly
persons may reside in family designated projects, the analyst will need to list all existing units and not just the
existing elderly units. Photographs of the comparables are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The analyst will explore the availability of individual Section 8 certificates with the local housing authority
since they can be used on any project to bring the existing rents into an affordable range. For instance, 10 to 15 available
Section 8 certificates in a community could have an influence on the determination for new units and the number should
be reduced to correspond to this availability. However, before automatically reducing the number of proposed units
to match the number of available Section 8 units, the reason the certificates are available must be explored, (e.g.,
owners of non-Government subsidized units will not accept the certificates). (The bedroom sizes which the certificates
cover must match the prospective bedroom sizes in the proposed project bedroom mix.)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 2, 1993, the Food Safety and Inspection Service published a final rule (58 FR 41138) which amended part 318
of the Federal meat regulations by adding a new &sect;318.23 (9 CFR 318.23) which prescribes heat-processing procedures,
cooking instructions, and cooling, handling, and storage requirements for uncured meat patties. The rule also amended
part 320 of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 320) by adding a new &sect;320.1(b)(7) (9 CFR 320.1(b)(7))
which prescribes the records to be kept by establishments. There was one numbering error in that section. The section
number is corrected as follows:

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;1A10
series airplanes, that currently requires modification of the right aileron and aileron tab. That AD was prompted
by an updated flutter analysis performed by the manufacturer, which revealed a potential flutter condition on these
airplanes. The actions specified in that AD are intended to prevent potential flutter of the rudder-aileron interconnect
tab, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. This amendment revises the applicability of
the rule by adding additional airplanes that are subject to the addressed unsafe condition.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 13, 1993, the FAA issued AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
93&hyph;16&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;8663 (58 FR 46766, September 3, 1993), applicable to certain Canadair Model
CL&hyph;215&hyph;1A10 series airplanes, to require installing weights to the aileron balance weight mounting
channel and installing washers to the interconnect tab mass balance arms. That modification will maintain an aileron
control surface mass balance within specified limits. That action was prompted by an updated flutter analysis, performed
by Canadair during the development of the Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 turboprop airplane, which revealed that
a potential flutter condition affecting the rudder-aileron interconnect tab could occur on certain Canadair Model
CL&hyph;215&hyph;1A10 series airplanes. (The Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 is a Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;1A10
that has been converted from piston engine power to turbopropeller power.) This flutter analysis further revealed
that, if the rudder-aileron interconnect mechanism fails, a flutter condition could occur at pressure altitudes
above 10,000 feet. The actions required by that AD are intended to prevent potential flutter of the rudder-aileron
interconnect tab, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AD 93&hyph;16&hyph;06 is applicable only to Canadair Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;1A10 series airplanes that are not
equipped with powered ailerons. Since issuance of that AD, however, Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness
authority for Canada, has advised that additional airplanes may be subject to the same unsafe condition addressed
by the previous AD action. Further analysis has indicated that the flutter problems associated with the rudder-aileron
interconnect tab may occur on all Canadair Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;1A10 series airplanes, including those equipped
with powered ailerons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Canada Aviation revised Canadian AD CF&hyph;90&hyph;11, dated June 26, 1990, to require installation
of the aileron modification on all Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;1A10 series airplanes, thereby assuring the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design, this AD is being issued to prevent potential flutter of the rudder-aileron interconnect tab, which could
result in reduced controllability of the airplane. This AD expands the applicability of the current rule to include
all Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CL&hyph;215&hyph;1A10 series airplanes. The requirements of the current rule remain unchanged. (The AD requires
modification of the right aileron and aileron tab.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There currently are no Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;1A10 series airplanes on the U.S. Register. All airplanes included
in the revised applicability of this rule currently are operated by non-U.S. operators under foreign registry; therefore,
they are not directly affected by this AD action. However, the FAA considers that the revision to the applicability
of the rule is necessary to ensure that the unsafe condition is addressed in the event that any of these subject airplanes
are imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately
20 work hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of this AD would be $1,100 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this AD action does not affect any airplane that is currently on the U.S. register, it has no adverse economic
impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary
and the amendment may be made effective in less than 30 days after publication in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;09&hyph;AD.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

 The National Archives and Records Administration is updating its regulations on location of records and hours of
use to add the National Archives at College Park (Archives II) facility which has opened in College Park, MD, and to
delete the Pickett Street facility in Alexandria, VA, which is no longer open for research. The rule is being issued
as an interim final rule so that the new facility hours will be established on the same date as the revised research room
hours in the National Archives Building. This rule will affect the public.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Archives at College Park research complex opened to the public on January 3, 1994. Records will continue
to be moved into the facility over the next two years as NARA completes a massive relocation of archival records from
its facilities in the Washington, DC, area. Upon completion of the move, NARA will operate two archival research facilities
in the Washington, DC, area: The National Archives Building and the National Archives at College Park, also known
as Archives II. The Pickett Street facility in Alexandria, VA, which housed the Nixon Presidential materials and
Cartographic research rooms, has closed; the Suitland Research Room will close for archival records research in
1996 when all archival records are relocated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NARA is adopting the National Archives Building Central Research Room and Microfilm Research Room hours at Archives
II. Uniform hours at the two facilities will allow adequate coverage in the research rooms. We considered selecting
different days for the Archives II complex to have extended hours; however, we concluded that such an action would
complicate staffing the research rooms during extended hours without providing significant benefit to most researchers.
With the allocation of records between the National Archives Building and Archives II based on grouping of related
records in one facility, most researchers will use either the National Archives Building or Archives II, but not both.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is being issued as an interim final rule without prior notice of proposed rulemaking as permitted by the Administrative
Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) when the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon
are impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. NARA finds that the public interest would be served
by early establishment of extended research room hours at the new Archives II facility. Because NARA wishes to establish
uniform hours for the Archives II research complex and the National Archives Building principal research rooms,
NARA was unable to begin the rulemaking process for the Archives II facility until its rulemaking amending research
room hours in the National Archives Building was completed. The final rule establishing hours for the National Archives
Building is published elsewhere in today's

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NARA will issue a final rule confirming or amending the Archives II research complex hours at the close of the comment
period for this interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 and has
not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby
certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NARA published a notice of proposed rulemaking on September 22, 1993 (58 FR 49251) proposing that certain research
rooms in the National Archives Building that were open weekday evenings and on Saturday close at 8 p.m. instead of 10
p.m., Monday through Friday, and at 5 p.m. instead of 5:15 p.m. on Saturdays. Over 70 comments were received, most opposing
the proposed change. Many of these commenters noted that the reduction in evening hours would adversely impact local
researchers who conduct their research in the evening after their workday as well as visiting researchers who want
to maximize their research time in as short a period as possible and local evening classes who visit the National Archives
on night-time field trips. Commenters who use the Microfilm Research Room noted that the reduced hours would further
limit access to microfilm readers, for which there is frequently a waiting period. Several commenters offered alternative
research room schedules, such as a 9 p.m. weekday closing, later opening, or closing early on selected days of the week.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters who favored the proposed change were primarily audiovisual archives researchers. Most of these commenters
stated that extending the research hours for still pictures, cartographic, electronic and Nixon holdings at the
National Archives at College Park facility (Archives II) would compensate for shortened hours in other research
rooms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully considering all comments, NARA has developed a revised research room schedule that would accommodate
the concerns of the commenters and provide adequate staff coverage in the research rooms. NARA held a public meeting
on December 13, 1993, to discuss the comments received on the proposed rule and to solicit comments on the revised schedule.
Notice of the meeting was provided individually to each commenter and a notice of the meeting was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63133). Twenty-one persons, including members of the public and NARA staff, attended the
meeting. In addition, NARA received seven letters and three telephone calls from individuals who could not attend
the meeting. These comments were also considered in the preparation of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this final rule, NARA is modifying research room hours in the Central Research Room and Microfilm Research Room
in the National Archives Building to be 8:45 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday and Wednesday; 8:45 a.m. to 9 p.m., Tuesday, Thursday,
and Friday; and 8:45 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., Saturday. The hours for the Motion Picture, Sound, and Video Research Room have
been deleted from this final rule because that research room will close for relocation to Archives II before the effective
date of this final rule. (That research room will be covered by a separate rulemaking on research room hours at Archives
II.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The days for 9 p.m. closing of the research rooms were chosen to include days when other research facilities, including
the Library of Congress, do not have evening hours. To further minimize the impact of the changed hours on researchers
in the Central and Microfilm Research Rooms, NARA will not invoke the 36 CFR 1254.12(a) provision that researchers
must return records up to 15 minutes before closing time in those research rooms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 and
it has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is
hereby certified that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on small entities.

be sent to a claimant prior to accomplishing an action adversely affecting benefit payments. The intended effects
of the change are to allow earlier adjudicative response in certain situations and to reduce the amount of potential
overpayments.

The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612.
The reason for this certification is that these amendments would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these amendments are exempt from the initial
and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.

1. In this Order, on our own motion, we reconsider the expiration date of the freeze of regulated cable service revenues,
and extend the expiration date of the freeze from February 15, 1994 until May 15, 1994. Later this month, the Commission
will consider pending petitions to reconsider various aspects of its rate regulations. In considering the petitions
for reconsideration and other issues outstanding in the rate regulation proceedings, the Commission will address,
among other issues, the benchmark/price cap methodology, relief for small systems and so-called ``going forward
issues.'' The Commission also plans to adopt cost of service rules. This short extension of the freeze is the minimum
amount of time required to enable affected parties to familiarize themselves with any modifications to the cable
rate regulations before the freeze is lifted.

2. In the Rate Order issued in May 1993, we established a comprehensive regulatory framework providing for rate regulation
of the basic service tier by local franchising authorities and of cable programming services tiers by the Commission
as required under the Cable Act of 1992. We established June 21, 1993 as the effective date of our new rate regulations.
At the same time, we were concerned that during the period between adoption of our rules and the earliest practical
opportunity for local franchising authorities to establish regulation of the basic service tier, and for consumers
to file complaints with the Commission concerning rates for cable programming services tiers, cable operators could
raise rates, effectively undermining the statutory mandate that rates for cable services remain reasonable. In
particular, we were concerned that cable operators could raise rates to potentially unreasonable levels, as determined
under the rate regulations ultimately adopted. We determined that a freeze of regulated cable service revenues until
August 3, 1993 would provide a reasonable opportunity for local franchise authorities to become certified to regulate
the basic service tier and for consumers to invoke by complaint the Commission's regulatory oversight over cable
programming services tiers. Accordingly, we established a freeze until that date of revenues for cable services
subject to regulation under the Cable Act of 1992. Under the freeze, the average monthly subscriber bill for cable
services and associated equipment subject to rate regulation under the Cable Act of 1992 may not increase above the
level determined under rates in effect on April 5, 1993. The Commission provided for waivers of the rate freeze in particular
cases where a cable operator can demonstrate that the freeze would impose severe economic hardship or threaten the
viability of continued cable service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Subsequently, the Commission reexamined the feasibility of implementing rate regulation by June 21, 1993 in view
of the significant additional responsibilities imposed on the Commission by the Cable Act of 1992 and a severe funding
shortfall faced by the Commission at that time. We extended the freeze until November 15, 1993. Our regulations establishing
rate regulation of cable service became effective September 1, 1993. However, those regulations were subject to
reconsideration. Because the rate regulations were pending reconsideration, by early November, 1993, the Commission
had received applications for certification from local franchising authorities representing less than 20 percent
of communities that may regulate the basic service tier. Accordingly, on November 10, 1993, the Commission further
extended the freeze on regulated revenues until February 15, 1994. We stated that, where local governments already
have initiated rate regulation of the basic tier, we were not concerned that rates for the tier could raise to unreasonable
levels after November 15, 1993. We noted that in the initial freeze order, we determined that a freeze on rates for the
cable programming services tier was necessary to prevent operators from evading the freeze by moving programming
from the basic to the cable programming service tier. We concluded in the Nov. 10 Extension Order that it was unnecessary
to continue the freeze for cable programming service tiers where the basic tier has become subject to rate regulation.
Accordingly, we amended the rule to make clear that the freeze would no longer apply to regulated cable services provided
by cable operators whose basic cable service has become subject to rate regulation by a local franchising authority
or the Commission. As a result, the number of cable systems subject to the freeze decreases as franchising authorities
become certified.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. As of January 31, 1994, the Commission had received 4,896 applications for certification from local franchising
authorities covering approximately 7,534 communities served by cable. Although these figures for certifications
are significant increases from the last time we extended the freeze, they still represent only a small percentage
of the nearly 30,000 communities that are potentially eligible to regulate the basic service tier. We continue to
believe that it is important to provide franchising authorities and other affected parties sufficient time to become
familiar with any modifications to our rate regulations before the freeze is lifted. We expect to act on reconsideration
by the end of this month, and we believe that it is important that the statutory goal of ensuring reasonable rates not
be undermined in the interim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Administrative Procedure Act requires that new substantive rules be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at least 30 days prior to their effective date. In the event that we adopt any substantive changes to our rules on reconsideration,
we anticipate that such revised rules would be released approximately 30 days after adoption and that these regulations
would be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 within 15 days thereafter. In addition, we will be adopting rules addressing issues raised in the Third Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking, 58 FR 46737 (Sep. 2, 1993). Thus, under this schedule, any new regulations adopted would become effective
approximately 75 days after adoption. Extension of the freeze for that period of time is the minimum amount of time
required to enable the Commission to adopt modified rules, should it choose to do so, and for such rules to become effective
before the freeze is lifted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. We believe that this brief extension of the freeze will ensure that local regulators have been afforded a sufficient
opportunity to file for certification and prepare for rate regulation under any modified rules that may be adopted.
This extension should provide sufficient time for local regulators to become familiar with their rights and obligations
under any such new regulations before cable operators are free to raise rates absent regulation. We emphasize that
we will continue to provide cable operators the opportunity to file petitions for relief which demonstrate, in individual
cases, that the freeze is causing severe economic hardship or threatens the viability of continued provision of cable
service. Throughout the duration of the rate freeze, we have received only five such petitions for relief. Thus, we
conclude that only a small percentage of cable operators believe that the freeze has imposed hardship sufficient
to compel them to seek relief from the freeze.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. We also note that the Commission has acted expeditiously in addressing petitions for reconsideration of its rate
regulation rules. In adopting rate regulations for the cable television industry, the Commission recognized that
the rules would require further refinement based on survey data of the cable television industry to be gathered and
analyzed by the Commission. Shortly after the new rules became effective, the Commission conducted a survey to collect
the data necessary to help it assess the rate regulations. The Commission has analyzed this survey data and is now in
a position to resolve the pending petitions for reconsideration by the end of this month. In addition to analyzing
the survey data during the period since adoption of the rate rules, the Commission has accommodated the requests of
numerous cable operators, franchise authorities, programmers and many other interested parties, to meet with the
Commission's new Chairman, who assumed office on November 29, 1993, for the purpose of expressing their views on the
issues which the Commission will address on reconsideration of the rate rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. We find good cause under the Administrative Procedure Act to make this freeze effective with less than 30 days advance
publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As explained, an extension of the freeze from February 15, 1994 until May 15, 1994 is necessary to afford local franchising
authorities a sufficient period in which to familiarize themselves with any revised regulations governing regulated
cable service rates that the Commission may adopt on reconsideration later this month. We will make this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and implementing rule changes effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to prevent an expiration of the freeze that would otherwise occur with 30 days advance publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Such a result would seriously undermine the statutory goals of cable rate regulation and would be contrary to the
public interest.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends Standard No. 121, Air Brake Systems, with respect to the requirements related to the application
and holding of parking brake systems and the requirements related to the supply line pressure retention for trailer
brakes. NHTSA initiated rulemaking to respond to concerns raised by International Transquip Industries (ITI) which
manufactures air-applied, mechanically held parking brakes. These amendments provide regulatory relief by removing
unnecessary restrictions to facilitate the use of alternative brake systems, without adversely affecting safety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Manufacturers typically comply with the parking brake requirements in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No.
121, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Air Brake Systems
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, by equipping their air-braked vehicles with spring brake systems. With these brake systems, air pressure holds
the spring in the released position when a vehicle is being driven. Upon parking, the air pressure is vented, allowing
the springs to apply the parking brakes. Consistent with NHTSA's policy to issue Federal safety standards that are
not unnecessarily design restrictive, the agency has conducted a number of rulemakings to ensure that the standard
does not unnecessarily prevent the manufacture of parking brake systems other than conventional spring brake systems
(e.g., air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems). See 44 FR 46850, August 9, 1979; 51 FR 10641, March
28, 1986; 56 FR 26927, June 12, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, International Transquip Industries, Inc. (ITI), a manufacturer of an air-applied, mechanically held parking
brake system, informed NHTSA that it believed two of Standard No. 121's current requirements are unnecessarily design
restrictive or otherwise inappropriate for its brake system design. One of these requirements specifies that a vehicle
must meet parking brake grade holding requirements on a 20 percent grade (or other equivalent requirements), with
``any single leakage-type failure'' of certain parts, including a failed diaphragm. See S5.6 of Standard No. 121.
ITI argued that this requirement is unnecessarily restrictive with respect to its air-applied, mechanically held
single diaphragm brake system. That company argued that its brake system is designed so that the diaphragm will never
experience a major failure, and that vehicles equipped with its brake system can be parked on a 20 percent grade in the
presence of the types of diaphragm failures that typically occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other requirement that ITI believed is inappropriate for its brake design is the supply line pressure requirement
for trailers. See S5.8.2. This requirement addresses brake drag. According to ITI, it is inappropriate for its brake
system, which is designed so that its brakes are either fully applied or fully released.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Comments on the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering ITI's arguments, NHTSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed certain changes
to Standard No. 121. (58 FR 13437, March 11, 1993). Specifically, the agency proposed to amend the requirements related
to the application and holding of parking brake systems and the requirements related to the supply line pressure retention
for trailer brakes. In that notice, the agency tentatively concluded that these amendments would remove unnecessary
restrictions, thus facilitating the use of air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems. The agency further
explained that the Standard should not unnecessarily prevent parking brake systems that are different than conventional
spring brake systems. The agency believed that this proposal would provide regulatory relief by removing a restriction
affecting the use of non-spring brake systems, while continuing to ensure appropriate grade holding performance
of air braked heavy vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA received twelve comments on the proposal. Among the commenters were ITI, which commented twice; the Motor Equipment
Manufacturers Association (MEMA), a trade association that represents heavy duty brake manufacturers; spring
brake manufacturers and spring brake rebuilders, including Midland-Grau, MGM Brakes, Neway Anchorlok, Allied
Signal, TSE Brakes, and Ferodo America; heavy vehicle manufacturers including GM/Volvo White and Freightliner;
and the American Trucking Associations (ATA). There was no consensus among the commenters about whether the proposal
should be adopted. While ITI favored the proposal which it believed would eliminate an unnecessary design restriction,
the manufacturers of spring brake systems opposed it. The spring brake manufacturers would experience increased
competition from the additional use of air-applied, mechanically held systems, which, according to ITI currently
represent 2 percent of the air brake chamber market. The ITI system would provide weight savings but would cost an additional
$28 more per axle than spring brake chambers. The spring brake manufacturers argued that the proposal poses significant
safety problems since they believe that brake diaphragms can and do experience rapid catastrophic failures. The
commenters also addressed specific issues about the proposed test procedure for air-applied, mechanically held
parking brake systems and the need to retain the supply line pressure requirement for vehicles equipped with these
systems. The agency has analyzed the comments and responds to the significant ones below.

1. Background Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 121 currently requires an air-braked vehicle to have a parking brake system that enables it to meet certain
grade holding requirements. Manufacturers have the option of complying with either a 20 percent grade holding test
or an equivalent static drawbar pull test. The purpose of the parking brake requirement is to ensure that an air-braked
vehicle has adequate parking brake performance on a grade.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standard provides that the parking brake grade holding requirements must be met with ``any'' single leakage-type
failure of certain parts, including service brake diaphragms. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that a driver
can safely park a vehicle in the event of a leakage-type failure in the service brake system. The standard specifies
``any'' failure because leakage-type failures of many types, sizes, and locations can occur in vehicle brake systems.
To ensure that a vehicle has adequate grade holding performance regardless of the specific nature or extent of a leakage-type
failure, the agency intentionally did not limit the size or location of such failures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA explained that most brake systems are designed with two diaphragms, one for the service brake function
and one for the parking brake function. Further, most brake systems incorporate a spring brake for parking. These
brake systems can easily meet the parking brake holding requirements with a failure in the service brake diaphragm,
because a failure in that diaphragm does not adversely affect parking brake performance. In contrast, the ITI air-applied,
mechanically held brake system has only one diaphragm that provides both the parking brake and service brake functions.
A hole in that diaphragm can therefore affect both parking brake and service brake performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to ITI, it is inappropriate to require vehicles to meet grade holding requirements with ``any'' failure
in the common diaphragm of its brake system, because its system is designed so that a hole in the diaphragm with not get
any larger than 1/8 inch during real-world use. ITI further stated that a vehicle equipped with its brake system will
hold on a 20 percent grade and can never be driven with a failure larger than 1/8 inch. This is because, according to ITI,
diaphragm failures begin as very small holes, develop very slowly, and its brakes will not release once the hole gets
larger than 1/8 inch. Thus, once a hole gets that large and the driver parks the vehicle at the end of the day, it will not
be possible to drive the vehicle without repairing the brakes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the NPRM, NHTSA evaluated the issues raised by ITI through tests of the air-applied, mechanically
held system conducted at the agency's Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC). (See, Evaluation of Mini-Max Parking
Forces with Chamber Diaphragm Failures, December 17, 1992, which has been placed in Docket No. 93&hyph;17, Notice
1.) That testing confirmed that vehicles equipped with the ITI system could not be unparked in the presence of a relatively
small failure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA sought comment on two primary issues related to air-applied, mechanically held brake systems:
(1) Whether the current requirement is appropriate for an air-applied, mechanically held brake system like ITI's
system and (2) whether it is possible to develop a test procedure that will identify the ``worst case'' diaphragm failure
that might be experienced in the real world.

2. Diaphragm Failure Modes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA discussed whether air-applied, mechanically held brake systems only experience small, gradual
failures or whether they can experience catastrophic failures.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 If diaphragms do in fact experience catastrophic failures, then the proposed requirement would not ensure the safety
of air-braked vehicles. However, based on information provided by ITI and the agency's analysis of that information,
NHTSA assumed, for purposes of this rulemaking, that diaphragm failures begin small and develop very slowly. Accordingly,
the proposed test procedure was designed to evaluate the small, gradual leakage-type failures that, according to
ITI, occur with its system. Notwithstanding NHTSA's decision to propose requirements that would be appropriate
only if diaphragms only experience small, gradual leakage-type failures, the agency sought comment about whether
catastrophic diaphragm failures occur in the real world.

By ``catastrophic failure,'' the agency means one in which a service brake application is made and the diaphragm fails,
for any reason, to an extent that the brake chamber will not generate sufficient torque to add significantly to the
vehicle's braking. Types of catastrophic failures include puncturing the diaphragm with a broken spring, pulling
the diaphragm loose from the air brake chamber clamp ring, or blowing a large hole in the diaphragm.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters expressed conflicting views about the nature of diaphragm failures. On the one hand, ITI reiterated
its view that diaphragm failures begin small and develop very slowly because the diaphragms use a rip stop nylon fabric.
This led ITI to conclude that long before a hole becomes large enough to affect parking capabilities, it is no longer
possible to release the parking brakes. ITI accordingly requested that diaphragms be excluded from failure testing.
On the other hand, the spring brake manufacturers (Midland-Grau, MGM Brakes, Neway Anchorlok, Allied Signal, MEMA,
and Ferodo) stated that diaphragms can and do experience rapid massive failure in addition to the gradual failure
discussed by ITI. The spring brake manufacturers alleged that there were several catastrophic failure modes, including:
(1) The piston plate wearing a hole through the diaphragm, (2) air permeating between the rubber or neoprene compound
causing it to balloon out and then blow, (3) the effects of exposing the diaphragm to oil which causes the compound to
delaminate from the fabric, (4) broken springs or piston plates cutting into the diaphragm, (5) and manufacturing
defects in the nylon fabric. Neway Anchorlok believed that because these catastrophic failure modes can occur between
parking brake applications, they may significantly and suddenly impair the service brake's capabilities. The potential
for catastrophic failures led the spring brake manufacturers to recommend that the agency retain the ``any leakage''
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the conflicting comments, NHTSA decided to examine further the failure modes experienced by diaphragms.
To this end, the agency visually inspected failed diaphragms submitted by Bendix, Ferodo, and MGM. In addition, the
agency contacted diaphragm manufacturers. In its examination of diaphragms submitted by various manufacturers,
NHTSA found no evidence of catastrophic failure; rather, the agency found that failures typically involved slow
deterioration through extended use. The only time the agency found a catastrophic failure was when there was a rapid
air loss resulting from a spring puncture or a pull-out from the clamp band area. Spring puncture failures are not relevant
to the present rulemaking about air-applied, mechanically held systems which do not have springs. With respect to
possible pull-out, ITI has stated that if, in servicing its units, the diaphragm is installed improperly, the brakes
cannot be released upon air-up of the system. The agency has placed the findings of its inspection of failed diaphragms
in the docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to agency inquiries, Longwood Elastomers and Goodyear, two large diaphragm manufacturers, stated that
diaphragms do not fail catastrophically. While they acknowledge that some failure modes mentioned by the spring
brake manufacturers do occur (e.g., spring puncture, plate chaff, unseating, flex cracking in the bead area, accelerated
degradation caused by exposure to oil), they contended that such failures either happen so infrequently that they
do not raise safety concerns or would not happen with an air-applied, mechanically held brake system (e.g., a single
diaphragm brake system has no heavy spring brake that can pierce the diaphragm after failing from fatigue). With respect
to failure rates, one diaphragm manufacturer informed the agency that it had returns of about 20 units from an annual
production of between 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 units. This failure rate translates to a reliability of about 99.999
percent. These reliability figures are for the useful lifecycle before wearout begins. All diaphragms would eventually
wear out. Therefore, diaphragms in air-applied, mechanically held systems and in the service side of spring brake
systems are typically replaced after between four and five years of service. The diaphragm manufacturers further
stated that they have never encountered a catastrophic failure during cycle testing of their production runs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on NHTSA's review of the failed diaphragms, contacts with diaphragm manufacturers and other available information,
the agency has concluded that diaphragms used with air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems do not fail
catastrophically. Rather, the typical failure mode with these systems is a gradual deterioration through extended
use. The agency further notes that GM/Volvo White and Freightliner, which use ITI air brake chambers as original equipment
on their vehicles when ordered by a customer, have not experienced any catastrophic failures with these systems.
Accordingly, the agency concludes that the current requirement to require vehicles to meet the parking brake requirements
with ``any'' single leakage type failure is unnecessarily design-restrictive with respect to air-applied, mechanically
held air brake systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ITI requested that NHTSA exclude diaphragms entirely from failure testing with respect to the parking brake requirements.
However, NHTSA has decided that an exclusion would be inappropriate. A diaphragm is an integral part of the parking
brake system, and the failure of a diaphragm can have adverse safety consequences. Therefore, excluding diaphragms
from such testing would be inconsistent with the safety purposes of the standard. Such an exclusion would be inconsistent
with the underlying purpose of the parking brake requirements which serve to ensure that a driver can safely park a
vehicle in the event of a leakage-type failure in the service brake system. Because diaphragms do fail, as ITI readily
admits, it would be inconsistent with the parking brake requirements to exclude such an important component in the
brake system from the relevant test requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed a test procedure that it tentatively concluded would identify the ``worst case'' leakage-type
diaphragm failure that is likely to occur with brake systems using common diaphragms. Under the proposed procedure,
the first step would be to determine the threshold level of diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of
leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which the vehicle's parking brakes become unreleasable.
A measurement would then be taken of the leakage rate associated with that level of failure. The proposal explained
that the ``threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate'' is the rate of reservoir air pressure decrease, for whichever
of the vehicle's reservoirs that is experiencing the most rapid decrease in pressure level, that results from that
threshold level of leakage. The agency proposed that a vehicle would be required to meet grade holding requirements
with a level of diaphragm leakage-type failure that results in a reservoir leakage rate that is three times the threshold
maximum reservoir leakage rate. This ``three times'' safety factor was included to account for the possibility that
a small diaphragm failure could grow larger between parking brake applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Midland-Grau, ITI, and Allied Signal believed that the proposed test procedure was unnecessarily complex. Midland-Grau
stated that the procedures were difficult to follow and could be interpreted in many ways. Midland-Grau requested
that NHTSA modify the test procedure so that it could be easily followed. Moreover, it stated its preference for testing
parameters that are concise, and lead to consistent test results that allow easy assessment of whether the system
passes or fails. ITI requested that the agency simplify the test to make it less complicated. Allied Signal criticized
the proposal for being overly complex, claiming that multiple attempts would be necessary to establish the size of
diaphragm failure for both release and application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the proposal in light of the comments, NHTSA believes that the proposed test procedure, with minor
adjustments, is appropriate to evaluate brake systems that incorporate a common diaphragm. The agency further believes
that the test procedure is not unreasonably complicated. In particular, the agency's experience at VRTC in running
the tests indicates that the tests are not overly burdensome and that with a valving meter in place, various pressure
levels of leakage can be obtained relatively quickly and without much difficulty. The agency notes that to simplify
testing, it could have specified a fixed orifice size to be used for all systems. However, such an approach would have
prevented certain parking brake systems and thus have been unnecessarily design restrictive, since the size of leak
at which sufficient force is generated to park the vehicle varies for different systems. In contrast, the variable
leak rate procedure that the agency is adopting in this final rule may be used to evaluate any brake system regardless
of its design.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to specific comments and further analysis of the regulatory text, NHTSA has made some minor changes to
the proposed test procedures applicable to air-applied, mechanically held brake systems. For instance, in response
to criticisms by Midland-Grau of terminology that it believed was ambiguous, NHTSA has deleted reference to ``certain
level'' of failure as proposed in S5.6(b). In addition, as explained below, the agency has modified the terminology
related to the concept of parking brake ``release.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, NHTSA has decided to retain the following terms that Midland-Grau criticized: ``Increasing or decreasing,''
``threshold level of diaphragm leakage,'' ``threshold maximum reservoir leakage associated with that level of
failure,'' and ``threshold of allowable leakage.'' With respect to finding the leakage rate at which the parking
brake system becomes unreleasable, the agency believes it is necessary for the test evaluator to find the appropriate
threshold level with ``progressively increasing or decreasing levels'' of failure because each brake configuration
is different. While this procedure will require some searching for the leakage rate at which the system becomes unreleasable,
the agency believes the appropriate level of failure can be ascertained without too much difficulty by using metering
valves. NHTSA notes that in VRTC's testing to develop this rule's requirements and procedures, the agency installed
an adjustable metering valve in the brake chamber housing to simulate a leak in the brake chamber diaphragm. The ``threshold
level of common diaphragm leakage type failure'' at which the parking brakes become unreleasable was determined
by increasing the leakage rate, by ``opening'' the metering valve, from one test to the next in relatively large increments
until the parking brakes would not release. Then, the metering valve was ``closed,'' to decrease the leakage rate,
in smaller increments until the parking brakes would release. The leakage rate was then increased by even smaller
increments until the parking brakes were again unreleasable. The precision with which the final determination of
the ``threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure'' at which the parking brakes become unreleasable
is determined by the number of times the direction of leakage rate change, e.g., from increasing to decreasing and
vice versa, and the magnitude of the increments by which the leakage rate is increased or decreased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to various references to the concept of the ``threshold,'' the agency has modified these provisions
slightly to use just two terms: ``Threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure'' in S5.6.7.1.1 and S5.6.7.2.1
and the ``threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate'' in S5.6.7.1.2 and S5.6.7.2.2. NHTSA, nevertheless, disagrees
with Midland-Grau's more general concern that the term ``threshold'' is ambiguous. The agency notes that the dictionary
defines ``threshold'' to mean ``a level, point, or value above which something is true or will take place and below
which it is not or will not.''
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Applying this definition to the parking brake test for systems with common diaphragms, the agency believes that ``threshold
level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure'' is an objective term that means the initial level at which the parking
brake can no longer be released. Similarly, the meaning of the phrase ``threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate''
was discussed in the NPRM and means the rate of reservoir air pressure decrease that results at that threshold level
of leakage.

With respect to the concept of ``release,'' NHTSA has decided to clarify the term so that it covers brake applications
that involve a vehicle being parked on a grade or a drawbar pull test. NHTSA notes that in addressing a similar issue
in an earlier rulemaking about what was meant by ``release,'' the agency stated that ``NHTSA considers a brake to be
released at the point where it no longer exerts any torque.'' (37 FR 12495, June 24, 1972). The agency believes that
this discussion of release is pertinent to the procedure set forth in S5.6(b). Accordingly, in the final rule, the
agency has specified that the relevant consideration is when the parking brakes ``become unreleasable.'' Since
the final rule specifies the criteria in terms of ``becom(ing) unreleasable,'' Midland-Grau's concerns about when
the released condition exists or about the status of a partial release are no longer relevant.

Midland-Grau requested that the agency provide an acceptable leakage value for each brake component. It further
stated that statements about ``compressor shut-off points'' and ``air flow'' should be pinned down to definitive
values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA disagrees with Midland-Grau's request to provide a specific level of leakage for each brake component. The
agency's goal in this rulemaking is to establish a performance test for the entire brake system, because the agency's
concern is to test for and prohibit system-wide failures that may pose safety problems. The agency therefore is not
concerned with the leakage level of any particular component. Nor does the agency believe it is necessary or appropriate
to specify definitive values for the compressor shut-off points. Such an action might be unnecessarily design restrictive
and serve to prohibit some manufacturers from selecting a higher cut off value than would be appropriate for its system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allied and Midland-Grau expressed concern that the rate of reservoir pressure drop is influenced by valving, plumbing,
and air supply capability. NHTSA acknowledges that these variables exist; however, the agency believes that they
are not large enough to adversely affect the test results. Specifically, as long as testing is done at three times the
leak rate, the actual numerical value of the leak rate is not overly important, because the value for the safety factor
is measured in the same way, which results in factoring out most of the variability. The agency further notes that these
variables are part of the manufacturing process and thus, if necessary, they can be controlled by the brake system
manufacturer. Moreover, alternative methods of testing would have necessitated using expensive flow meters that
would not significantly reduce the level of variability or otherwise improve the test results. NHTSA notes that while
the rate of air flow through the system may be affected by slight variations in air hose lengths from vehicle to vehicle,
internal size variations in the castings used in the hose fittings, and differences in valve tolerances; the leak
rates at issue are not sufficiently large to be significantly affected by this type of variability from vehicle to
vehicle. Internal drag on air flow does not become a factor until the flow rates become substantially higher than those
being measured here.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that a vehicle would be required to meet grade holding requirements with the level of diaphragm
leakage failure of three times the threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate. The agency reasoned that a safety factor
was necessary to address the situation when a small diaphragm failure grows larger between parking brake applications,
prior to the time the vehicle is parked (at which point the parking brakes would be unreleasable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Midland-Grau, ITI, and Allied objected to including a safety factor ``three times the threshold maximum reservoir
leakage.'' Midland-Grau stated that the rationale for this test is not easily visualized and is questionable as to
why it was selected as a test parameter. ITI stated that the safety factor should be eliminated to avoid additional
time and cost in compliance testing. Allied stated that it was not aware of any information or data that the agency used
to establish the three times reservoir pressure drop rate as being a ``worst case'' type of failure for a brake chamber
diaphragm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments, NHTSA continues to believe that it is necessary to include a safety factor in the application
and holding requirements for air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems. The agency notes that including
the provision for grade holding at ``three times the failure rate'' is essential to ensure the brake system's safety
since the hole associated with a diaphragm failure grows larger during the day. In addition, including a safety factor
serves to prevent marginal systems from being manufactured. The agency selected a safety factor of three based on
general engineering principles and the agency's testing at VRTC. In general, a safety factor needs to be as large as
possible to ensure safety, while not be too large to make it unreasonable, impracticable, and unaffordable. In agency
tests at VRTC, NHTSA determined that the ITI system would still produce sufficient parking force with a diaphragm
leak over ten times larger than the system would detect and still not release the parking brakes. Based on its understanding
of diaphragm failures associated with air-applied, mechanically held braking systems, NHTSA determined that a
safety factor of three was the most appropriate level of safety for inclusion in a FMVSS. The agency believes that this
level of safety will not require manufacturers to ``over-design'' their parking brake systems, but will ensure appropriate
brake system performance. NHTSA disagrees with ITI's comment that inclusion of a safety factor would add needless
complexity to the requirement. Agency testing at VRTC indicates that inclusion of a safety factor will not significantly
add to the time and cost of compliance testing. Essentially, as a result of the safety factor, a test evaluator needs
to establish the threshold value for the maximum reservoir leakage rate and then triple it. Based on its experience
at VRTC, the agency believes that this will add only five to ten minutes to the compliance testing (at only nominal additional
cost.)

B. Supply Line Pressure Requirements for Trailers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section S5.8.2 of Standard No. 121 currently requires that any single leakage type failure in the service brake system
must not result in the pressure in the supply line falling below 70 p.s.i., measured at the forward trailer supply coupling.
(See 56 FR 50666, October 8, 1991). The purpose of this provision is to prevent brake drag caused by the automatic application
of trailer parking brakes while the minimum trailer supply line pressure is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a June 5, 1992 letter to the agency, ITI requested that the agency ``exempt'' its brake system from S5.8.2. It argued
that this provision relates to problems caused by brake drag, a situation that it contends is not applicable to ITI's
brake system, which, by design, can only be in the fully applied or fully released positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering ITI's arguments, NHTSA, in the NPRM, tentatively concluded that no safety purpose would be served
to apply this provision to non-towing trailers using air-applied, mechanically held parking brakes that use a common
diaphragm. The agency noted that these vehicles do not use spring brakes and thus the requirement which addresses
the safety problem of brake drag is not relevant to them. Accordingly, the agency proposed to amend section S5.8.2
to clarify that this provision would not apply to non-towing trailers equipped with air-applied, mechanically held
parking brakes that use a common diaphragm. Nevertheless, NHTSA emphasized that section S5.8.2 would continue to
apply to towing trailers, since the 70 psi requirements may be necessary for other vehicles in the train.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Midland-Grau, ITI, ATA, and Allied Signal addressed the issue of whether the 70 psi supply line pressure requirement
should be retained for trailers, particularly towing trailers, equipped with air-applied, mechanically held parking
brakes. Midland-Grau stated that making the 70 psi requirement optional for towing trailers with air-applied mechanically
hold brake systems introduces a detriment to the couple vehicles in the event of system failure. This led Midland-Grau
to conclude that it is necessary to apply failure. This led Midland-Grau to conclude that it is necessary to apply the
supply line pressure requirements to trailers since a towing trailer will experience brake degradation if it is not
properly protected from towed trailer system failures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, ITI stated that this requirement should not be applied to either towing or non-towing vehicles equipped
with air-applied, mechanically held vehicles since they do not experience brake drag. This led ITI to state that S5.8.4
was not necessary, because it claimed that partial application or brake drag is not an issue with its brake systems.
Thus, it requested that towing trailers with air-applied, mechanically held systems be permitted without the 70
psi supply line protection feature, even though it acknowledge that this may result in some mismatches. In response
to Midland-Grau's comment, ITI stated that trailers equipped with spring brakes manufactured before and after the
October 1992 rule that specified these requirements (56 FR 50666, October 8, 1991) will experience compatibility
problems. Therefore, ITI believed that the problem raised by Midland-Grau will exist with spring brake equipped
trailers as well as trailers equipped with air-applied, mechanically held equipped trailers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA commented that the existing 70 psi supply line requirement is inappropriate and prevents tractor low air pressure
warning systems from warning drivers of the loss of service pressure in trailers. Therefore, it requested that the
agency either exempt all trailers from the 70 psi supply line requirement or modify the requirement. Allied Signal
similarly stated that the 70 psi requirement has undermined the effectiveness of the low pressure warning system,
especially for doubles and triples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided not to apply the supply lone pressure requirements to single trailers
equipped with air-applied, mechanically held brake systems. Such trailers, which do not experience brake drag,
also do not affect the braking of any other vehicle because they are not connected to other trailers. Therefore, as
discussed in the NPRM, this requirement would not benefit this type of trailer.

Nevertheless, the agency has decided that the supply line pressure requirements are relevant to air-applied, mechanically
held brake systems on towing trailers used in double and triple trailer combinations.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The agency is not convinced by ITI's argument that trailers equipped with their system should not have to comply with
the 70 psi requirement because there are older spring brake-equipped trailers that will pose similar compatibility
problems. The agency believes that there would be a safety problem if it were to apply the supply line pressure requirements
to certain vehicles in double or triple combinations but not others. Specifically, if ITI's request were adopted,
a trailer being towed by a trailer equipped with air-applied, mechanically held brakes would not necessarily receive
adequate air pressure and therefore could experience brake drag. The agency's decision to apply these requirements
to towing trailers is consistent with recent legislation and the efforts of the agency, manufacturers, and end-users
to standardize operating conditions to improve compatibility. Specifically, section 4012 of the Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) directs the agency to initiate rulemaking to improve compatibility of truck
tractors, trailers, and their dollies. The agency further notes that a specialized trailer protection valve could
be developed for ITI's system that would permit compliance with the requirements of S5.8.2 and S5.8.3.

the introduction of the requirement. Based on the above, the agency has determined that there is good cause to have

In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this action on small entities.
Based upon this evaluation, I certify that the amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Vehicle and brake manufacturers typically will not qualify as small entities. This amendment
will also affect small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units to the extent that these entities
purchase air-braked vehicles. As discussed above, the agency's assessment is that this amendment will have no significant
cost impact to the industry. For these reasons, vehicle manufacturers, small businesses, small organizations,
and small governmental units which purchase motor vehicles will not be significantly affected by the requirements.
Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.

(a) Except as provided in S5.6(b) and S5.6(c), each vehicle other than a trailer converter dolly shall have a parking
brake system that under the conditions of S6.1 meets the requirements of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) S5.6.1 or S5.6.2, at the manufacturer's option, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) S5.6.3, S5.6.4, S5.6.5, and S5.6.6.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) At the option of the manufacturer, for vehicles equipped with brake systems which incorporate a common diaphragm,
the performance requirements specified in S5.6(a) which must be met with any single leakage-type failure in a common
diaphragm may instead be met with the level of leakage-type failure determined in S5.6.7. The election of this option
does not affect the performance requirements specified in S5.6(a) which apply with single leakage-type failures
other than failures in a common diaphragm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) At the option of the manufacturer, the trailer portion of any agricultural commodity trailer, heavy hauler trailer,
or pulpwood trailer may meet the requirements of &sect;393.43 of this title instead of the requirements of S5.6(a).

 In the case of vehicles for which the option in S5.6(b) has been elected, determine the maximum level of common diaphragm
leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) according
to the procedures set forth in S5.6.7.1 through S5.6.7.2.3.

S5.6.7.1.1&blank;According to the following procedure, determine the threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type
failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which the vehicle's parking
brakes become unreleasable. With an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi, the engine turned off, no application
of any of the vehicle's brakes, and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch
test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, introduce a leakage-type failure of the common diaphragm (or
equivalent leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm). Apply the parking brakes by making an application
actuation of the parking brake control. Reduce the pressures in all of the vehicle's reservoirs to zero, turn on the
engine and allow it to idle, and allow the pressures in the vehicle's reservoirs to rise until they stabilize or until
the compressor shut-off point is reached. At that time, make a release actuation of the parking brake control, and
determine whether all of the mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking
brake applications with sufficient parking retardation force to meet the minimum performance specified in either
S5.6.1 or S5.6.2. Repeat this procedure with progressively decreasing or increasing levels (whichever is applicable)
of leakage-type diaphragm failures or equivalent leakages, to determine the minimum level of common diaphragm leakage-type
failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which all of the mechanical
means referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking brake applications with sufficient parking
retardation forces to meet the minimum performance specified in either S5.6.1 or S5.6.2.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S5.6.7.1.2&blank;At the level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the
air chamber containing that diaphragm) determined in S5.6.7.1.1, and using the following procedure, determine
the threshold maximum reservoir rate (in psi per minute). With an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi, the
engine turned off, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped
with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, make an application actuation
of the parking brake control. Determine the maximum reservoir leakage leakage rate (in psi per minute), which is the
maximum rate of decrease in air pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs that results after that parking brake application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S5.6.7.1.3&blank;Using the following procedure, introduce a leakage-type failure of the common diaphragm (or
equivalent leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) that results in a maximum reservoir leakage rate
that is three times the threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate determined in S5.6.7.1.2. With an initial reservoir
system pressure of 100 psi, the engine turned off, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes and, if the vehicle
is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling,
make an application actuation of the parking brake control. Determine the maximum reservoir leakage rate (in psi
per minute), which is the maximum rate of decrease in air pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs that results after
that parking brake application. The level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage
from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) associated with this reservoir leakage rate is the level that is to
be used under the option set forth in S5.6(b).

S5.6.7.2.1&blank;According to the following procedure, determine the threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type
failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which the vehicle's parking
brakes become unreleasable. With an initial reservoir system and supply line pressure of 100 psi, no application
of any of the vehicle's brakes, and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch
test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, introduce a leakage-type failure of the common diaphragm (or
equivalent leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm). Make a parking brake application by venting
the front supply line coupling to the atmosphere, and reduce the pressures in all of the vehicle's reservoirs to zero.
Pressurize the supply line by connecting the trailer's front supply line coupling to the supply line portion of the
trailer test rig (Figure 1) with the regulator of the trailer test rig set at 100 psi, and determine whether all of the
mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking brake applications with sufficient
parking retardation forces to meet the minimum performance specified in either S5.6.1 or S5.6.2. Repeat this procedure
with progressively decreasing or increasing levels (whichever is applicable) of leakage-type diaphragm failures
or equivalent leakages, to determine the minimum level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim specification of pollock in Statistical Area 62 was established by interim specifications (58 FR 60575,
November 17, 1993) as 4,563 metric tons (mt), determined in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(A).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii),
that the 1994 interim specification of pollock in Statistical Area 62 soon will be reached. The Regional Director
established a directed fishing allowance of 4,163 mt, and has set aside the remaining 400 mt as bycatch to support other
anticipated groundfish fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has
been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 62, effective
from 12 noon, A.l.t., February 9, 1994, until the second quarter's allowance becomes available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at &sect;672.20(g).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS announces a 1994 initial quota of 200,000 lobsters for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) crustacean
fishery. The quota was calculated according to the formula contained in Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan
for the Crustacean Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region (FMP). The final quota for the 1994 fishing year, which
begins July 1, 1994, will be announced after the first month of fishing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The crustacean fisheries of the NWHI are managed by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) according to the FMP, which
was prepared by the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations affecting the U.S. fishery are at 50 CFR part 681.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The annual quota for the crustacean fishery is announced in two steps. First, based on previous years' fishery data,
sampling during research cruises, and other available data, the Regional Director determines an initial quota,
which is announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA. A population model by which the quota is determined is described
in Amendment 7 to the FMP. The final quota for the year is then determined based on actual commercial fisheries data
collected during the first month of fishing. This actual catch and effort data, in conjunction with the previous information,
provides a more reliable indicator of the status of the lobster stocks in the NWHI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 7 provides that an annual quota be set at a level permitting an average catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of 1.0
for the fleet. In 1992, the initial quota was set at 750,000 lobsters, which was subsequently reduced to 438,000 lobsters
following an analysis of data obtained from the fishery. In 1993, there was no quota, and the fishery was closed for
the entire year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director has used the formula in Amendment 7 to set an initial quota for 1994 of 200,000 lobsters (spiny
and slipper lobsters combined). Data collected during NMFS survey cruises indicate that recruitment to the fishery
remained at about 840,000 lobsters during the 1992&hyph;93 period, and there were no removals of lobster by the fishery
in 1993; therefore, there is a net addition to the stock to support a fishery in 1994. The model projects a commercial
CPUE of 1.0 at the start of the fishing year with an initial quota of 200,000 lobsters. The final quota, to be announced
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as soon as practicable after August 15, 1994, may increase or decrease substantially from the initial quota. The Southwest
Region, NMFS, will monitor landings against the quota and issue timely reports of summary data. The Southwest Region
also will attempt to promptly notify participants in the fishery of any changes in the fishery; however, participants
are advised to contact the Southwest Region (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) periodically to stay of changes in the quota and progress of the fishery toward attaining the quota. Announcement
of a closure of the fishery due to reaching the quota will follow the procedures set forth in 50 CFR 681.31(c).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 30, 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;159 (107 Stat. 1536) was enacted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amending the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), as amended (18 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. Chapter 44). Title I of Public Law 103&hyph;159, cited as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ``Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act'' (hereinafter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``the Act''), provides for a national waiting period of 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days before a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may lawfully transfer a handgun to a nonlicensed individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(interim provision), and for the establishment of a national instant criminal background check system to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be queried by firearms licensees before transferring any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firearm to nonlicensed individuals (permanent provision). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permanent system will be effective on November 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1998. Violations of either the interim or permanent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision are punishable by a fine or imprisonment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not more than 1 year, or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Titles II and III of Public Law 103&hyph;159 relate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting requirements for multiple handgun sales, labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of packages containing a firearm, thefts of firearms from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensed firearms dealers, and increased license fees for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dealers in firearms. Regulations implementing these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions are also part of this Treasury decision.

Waiting Period (Interim Provision) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Act provides that the waiting period provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the law become effective on February 28, 1994, and cease to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply on November 30, 1998. The Act imposes a waiting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of 5 business days (defined in the statute as days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on which State offices are open) before a licensee may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sell or deliver a handgun. As defined in the Act, the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``handgun'' means_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
(A) a firearm which has a short stock and is designed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be held and fired by the use of a single hand; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) any combination of parts from which a firearm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in subparagraph (A) can be assembled. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Basically, the waiting period provision makes it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unlawful for any licensed firearms importer, manufacturer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or dealer to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonlicensed individual (transferee), unless the licensee_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Obtains a statement of the transferee's intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to obtain a handgun containing the transferee's name, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address, and date of birth appearing on a valid photo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification, a description of the identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document, a statement that the transferee is not a felon, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under indictment, or otherwise prohibited from receiving or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possessing the handgun under Federal law, and the date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement is made; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Verifies the identity of the transferee by examining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the identification document presented; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Within 1 day after the transferee furnishes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement, contacts the chief law enforcement officer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the place of residence of the transferee and advises such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer of the contents of the statement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Within 1 day after the transferee furnishes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement, transmits to the chief law enforcement officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the place of residence of the transferee a copy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Waits 5 business days from the date the licensee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished notice of the contents of the statement to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chief law enforcement officer before transferring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handgun to the transferee (during which period the licensee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has not received information from the chief law enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer that receipt or possession of the handgun by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferee would be in violation of law); or receives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice from the chief law enforcement officer of the place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of residence of the transferee that the officer has no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that the transferee's receipt or possession of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the handgun would violate the law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the items in (1) above, the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request certain additional optional information about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferee to facilitate the transfer of a handgun and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist law enforcement officials in verifying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferee's eligibility to possess a handgun. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optional information includes the social security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number, height, weight, sex, and place of birth of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferee. The optional information will help minimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the misidentification of handgun purchasers as felons or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other prohibited persons whose receipt and possession of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firearms violate the law. For example, this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would distinguish the transferee from a prohibited buyer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having the same name and date of birth as the transferee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, therefore, help expedite the transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the sale or transfer of the handgun, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law requires a licensee, who receives a report from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chief law enforcement officer containing information that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt or possession of the handgun by the transferee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violates Federal, State, or local law, shall within 1 day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communicate any information the licensee has concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer to the chief law enforcement officer of the place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of business of the licensee and to the chief law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement officer of the place of residence of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As provided in the Act, the term ``chief law enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer'' means ``the chief of police, the sheriff, or an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent officer or the designee of any such individual.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The law requires that the chief law enforcement officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 5 business days make a reasonable effort to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether the transferee is prohibited by law from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving or possessing the handgun sought to be purchased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for records relating to a proposed handgun sale that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would violate the law, law enforcement officers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to destroy within 20 days the purchaser's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement, any record containing information derived from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statement, and any record created as a result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice referred to in (3) above. Furthermore, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records may only be used to carry out the purposes of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, and no information in the records may be conveyed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any person for purposes other than complying with the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Act also provides that an individual who is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be ineligible to purchase a handgun under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiting period provision may request that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chief law enforcement officer who made the determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide reasons for that determination. The officer must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide such reasons to the individual in writing within 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business days after receipt of the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Alternatives to the Waiting Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The statute provides the following alternatives to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiting period provision: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The transferee provides a written statement issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the last 10 days by the chief law enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer of the transferee's place of residence that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferee requires a handgun because of a threat to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life of the transferee or any member of the transferee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The transferee presents to the licensee a permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued by the State within the past 5 years to possess a handgun and the law of the State requires verification that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the transferee is not prohibited by law from possessing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handgun; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Purchases in States which require that, before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any licensee transfers a handgun to an individual, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an authorized government official has verified that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possession of the handgun by the transferee would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violate the law (e.g., a background check); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Purchases of handguns which are subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Firearms Act and which have been approved for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer under 27 CFR part 179 (Machine Guns, Destructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Devices, and Certain Other Firearms); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Purchases of handguns for which the Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified that compliance with the 5-day waiting period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure is impracticable because the purchaser resides in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a rural area, the premises of the licensee are remote in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relation to the chief law enforcement officer of the area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and there is an absence of telecommunications facilities in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the geographical area in which the business premises are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local law enforcement agency of the jurisdiction in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sale or other disposition took place.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

which has been shipped or transported in interstate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4)

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this temporary rule is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a significant regulatory action, because the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects flow directly from the underlying statute and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from this temporary rule. Therefore, it is found that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary rule is not likely to (1) Have an annual effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health or safety, of State, local, or tribal governments or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Executive order.

Because this document merely implements the law and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because immediate guidance is necessary to implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the law, it is found to be impracticable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to issue this Treasury decision with notice and public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure under 5 U.S.C. &sect;553(b), or subject to the

The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to an initial and final regulatory flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis (5 U.S.C. 604) are not applicable to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary rule because the agency was not required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publish a notice of proposed rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This regulation is being issued without prior notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and public procedure pursuant to the Administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). For this reason, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection of information contained in this regulation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been reviewed and, pending receipt and evaluation of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OMB) under control number 1512&hyph;0520. The estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average annual burden associated with the collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of information in this regulation is 2.52 hours per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondent or recordkeeper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a)(1) Except as provided in &sect;&sect;178.102(b) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
178.131, a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

handgun unless the licensee has received from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form 5300.35 in duplicate. The statement shall contain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferee's name, address, and date of birth. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferee must date and execute the sworn statement contained on the form showing that the transferee is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a term exceeding 1 year; has not been convicted in any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
court of such a crime; is not a fugitive from justice; is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled

requests certain additional optional information. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information includes the social security number, height, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight, sex, and place of birth of the transferee. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information may help avoid the possibility of the

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 18, 1987, the FAA published a final rule (52 FR 44276) revising and reorganizing 14 CFR part 139 that became
effective on January 1, 1988. The revision included modified requirements, as contained in &sect;139.311, pertaining
to markings and lighting. On October 18, 1988, 14 CFR 139 was amended (53 FR 40842) to, among other things, establish
January 1, 1991 as the compliance date for the marking and lighting requirements in &sect;139.311. After the amendment
establishing the 1991 compliance date for &sect;139.311, however, the FAA decided to revise the guidance material
on one aspect of the marking requirements. The FAA undertook to revise the advisory circular (AC) related to signs
identifying taxiing routes on the movement area (&sect;139.311(a)(3)). The FAA wanted to resolve the controversies
regarding the types and design of airfield signs, applications, colors, and other matters. In addition, because
of the global nature of aviation, the FAA wanted its sign standards to be consistent with the ones being considered
by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for installation at airports throughout the world.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators of certificated airports were informed of this revision and encouraged to wait for publication of the revised
AC before attempting to comply with the requirements of &sect;139.311(a)(3). This was to preclude installation
of signs identifying taxiing routes on the movement area where significant changes were being considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process of revising the sign standards was further complicated by the involvement of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO). As noted above, ICAO was developing international airport sign standards during
the period the AC was being revised. To make sure the United States was in conformity internationally, the FAA met with
the ICAO to help develop standardization and consistency of airport signs. This precluded the FAA from issuing its
revised AC on sign standards until after the ICAO working group made recommendations for revised airport sign standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ICAO working group did not make its recommendations until May of 1991, months after the January 1, 1991 compliance
date set out in &sect;139.311(f). Prior to the deadline, however, the FAA began issuing exemptions to those airport
operators requesting them, and advised airport operators against installing signs solely for the purposes of complying
with &sect;139.311(a)(3). Airport operators were urged to wait until the FAA issued the revised AC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 31, 1991, the FAA issued its revised AC entitled ``Standards for Airport Sign Systems.'' The FAA estimated
that it would take several years at a minimum for certificated airports to comply with &sect;139.311(a)(3) because
of the lead time required to produce and install the new sign systems. Hence, certificated airports, through no fault
of their own, would not be able to meet the requirements of &sect;139.311(a)(3) for several years. The FAA decided
that instead of issuing approximately 600 exemptions, the appropriate response was to revise the regulations to
extend the compliance date for &sect;139.311(a)(3). The 1991 date for compliance for the other marking and lighting
requirements was retained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 24, 1992, the FAA issued a final rule (57 FR 15162) extending the compliance date with &sect;139.311(a)(3)
to January 1, 1994. The FAA knew that this was a very ambitious target date. Therefore, in this final rule, which was
issued without a prior notice of proposed rulemaking, the FAA requested comments from the public as to the reasonableness
of the new deadline. This was done to allow the FAA the opportunity to further extend the compliance date if necessary.
The FAA received two comments; one from the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) and one from the State of Alaska Department
of Transportation and Public Facilities (Alaska). ALPA supported the extension and encouraged the FAA to remain
steadfast in its implementation of &sect;139.311(a)(3). Alaska had several concerns with the established compliance
date of January 1, 1994. First, Alaska stated that they had 27 certificated airports that needed to be brought into
compliance. Due to the high demand for signs across the country, manufacturers would not be able to provide the materials
to these 27 airports in a time frame which would allow them to meet the new deadline. Alaska also was concerned with securing
the funding necessary to install new signs by January 1, 1994. Because they rely almost entirely on federal Airport
Improvement Program (AIP) funds for all capital improvement projects, they would have to defer other, more critical,
safety related projects in order to meet the new signage installation timeframe. Therefore, Alaska recommended
that, at the earliest, the installation timeframe be January 1, 1996.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA agrees substantially with both commenters. While it is important that every reasonable effort be made to come
into compliance with &sect;139.311(a)(3), a realistic date is necessary to adequately provide time for industry
to manufacture, and applicable operators to install, sign system on their airports consistent with the revised AC.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has determined that the very ambitious January 1, 1994, compliance deadline was unrealistic. Despite the
extraordinary efforts by both the FAA and operators of part 139 certificated airports, full compliance has not been
possible. An extensive survey by the FAA in the fall of 1993 indicates that approximately 60% of certificated airports
will be in compliance with &sect;139.311(a)(3) on January 1, 1994. The other 40% of certificated airports are working
hard towards compliance. The first step that an airport must do is develop a sign plan in conjunction with airport users
and submit it to the FAA for review and approval. This process has been completed and all certificated airports now
have approved signs plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has concluded that a combination of factors has prevented airports from full compliance. First, there are
only a handful of manufacturers of airport signs. As a result, these manufacturers have order backlogs. Once the signs
are ordered, it takes approximately 12&hyph;16 weeks for sign delivery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, implementing the new sign system requirements typically involves much more than just ordering and erecting
the new signs. Installation at many of the certificated airports requires electrically rewiring circuits for the
runways, taxiways, and signs because the existing systems cannot handle the increased electrical loads. In some
cases new electrical vaults need to be constructed. In other cases, electric lines have to be installed where none
now exist. This wiring can encompass significant construction; frequently the wires have to be installed across
runways, taxiways, and other paved areas. This signage and electrical work is further complicated by the need to keep
the runways and taxiways operational during construction to the maximum extent possible. An additional factor is
the varying construction seasons from region to region. In some areas the traditional construction season has been
affected by unusual weather disasters, such as the major flooding that occurred during the summer of 1993 in the midwest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, many airports have had to redesignate taxiways that previously had nonstandard designations. All taxiways
on airports certificated under part 139 will now be designated by a letter(s) of the alphabet or alpha numeric(s).
The process of renaming taxiways increases the scope of the signage work and requires additional time to phase in to
assure that users have adequate time to familiarize themselves with the new designations.

The FAA has concluded that a further extension until January 1, 1995, for compliance with the sign installation requirements
of &sect;139.311(a)(3) is necessary and reasonable. The time extension will obviate the need for numerous exemptions
to airport operators. This extension is not expected or intended to delay the date by which the actual signage work
will be completed. The FAA does not intend to grant any further extension to the rule deadline.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has determined that a review of the Convention on International Civil Aviation Standards and Recommended
Practices is not warranted because this rule merely extends the compliance date of an earlier final rule that incorporated
the recommendations and standards proposed by ICAO for new sign systems through Advisory Circular 150/5340&hyph;18C
entitled ``Standards for Airport Sign Systems.''

This final rule will not change the reporting requirements. Therefore, in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980, (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511), there are no additional requirements for information collection associated
with this final rule.

Economic Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has determined that this rule is not significant as defined by Executive Order 12866. Therefore, no Regulatory
Impact Analysis is required. Nevertheless, in accordance with Department of Transportation policies and procedures,
the FAA has evaluated the economic and technical feasibility of this final rule, which is summarized below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule amendment would amend the compliance date for certain airport signs required by the FAA from January
1, 1995. The current rule has a deadline of January 1, 1994. Approximately 40% of the certificated airports are still
not able to comply for reasons beyond their control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule will not impose any costs on society by extending the compliance date. There will be no incremental costs
associated with this final rule since only the date for compliance is being extended. The FAA has concluded that there
will be no degradation of safety as all certificated airports have installed the more critical safety-related signs
required under part 139. In addition, the 40% of certificated airports that have not yet installed the remaining required
signs are working on an expedited basis to remedy the situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has concluded that the rule change will be cost beneficial because unquantifiable benefits in the form of less
disruption and more opportunities for minimizing compliance costs for airport operators can be achieved without
compromising airport safety.

International Trade Impact Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule will affect domestic airport operators, primarily. The rule will have no impact on trade for U.S. firms doing
business overseas or for foreign firms doing business in the United States. There are no expected additional annual
costs associated with this rule and, therefore, it should not create an economic disadvantage to either domestic
or foreign air carriers operating in the United States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if a rule has a significant
economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number of small entities. The FAA's criterion
for a ``substantial number'' is a number that is not less than 11 and that is more than one third of the small entities
subject to the rule. The size threshold annualized cost level in December 1983 dollars is $5,400 for airports. Using
the GNP Price deflator and adjusting to 1990 values, this threshold becomes $7,387.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule is of a cost-relieving nature and would therefore afford cost savings to small airport sponsors. The impact
of the cost of complying with the sign requirements are expected to be quite small, however, since operators will still
be expected to meet the same requirements.

Federalism Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The final rule adopted herein will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have
sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the FAA has determined that this final rule is not significant under Executive
Order 12866; nor is it significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979). It is certified that under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act this rule will
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities. Because
of the negligible costs resulting from this rule, the FAA has determined that the expected impact of these regulations
is so minimal that they do not warrant a full regulatory evaluation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Reason for Immediate Adoption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule is being adopted immediately in response to comments received on an earlier issued final rule without prior
public notice and comment. This rule requires immediate adoption to amend and expired regulatory compliance date,
which has been an unintended burden on airport operators. By immediately adopting this amendment, the FAA alleviates
the burden and cost to airport operators to request, and the FAA to process, petitions for exemption. As stated above,
an amendment of the compliance date is necessary to adequately provide time for industry to manufacture and applicable
airports to install sign systems.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposes to restructure the procedures for licensing cottonseed samplers
to draw, prepare and submit cottonseed samples for USDA's official cottonseed grading program. The proposed revision
would significantly reduce the paperwork burden involved in the licensing of official cottonseed samplers by eliminating
the bonding requirement and the license fee, and extending the license period from 1 to 5 years. Under the proposed
revision, official cottonseed samplers would still be required to obtain a license from USDA, and sampling equipment
and procedures would continue to receive the same level of supervision from AMS Cotton Division personnel.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior
to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has certified that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) because: (1) The proposed changes in licensing procedures will decrease the cottonseed sampler's paperwork burden;
(2) the proposed change in licensing procedures will not affect competition in the marketplace; and (3) participation
in USDA's official cottonseed grading program is voluntary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements for cottonseed sampler licenses contained in this proposed rule have been
previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned OMB control number 0581&hyph;0008 under
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This proposed revision, if adopted, would significantly reduce the information collection requirements for
34 licensed cottonseed samplers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cottonseed sampler license form CN&hyph;248 requires an estimated 0.17 hours or 10.2 minutes to complete. The
paperwork burden for the 34 cottonseed samplers' license renewal each year amounts to 5.78 hours. This proposed rule,
by requiring that licenses be renewed every 5 years, will reduce the paperwork burden to 1.16 hours, an 80 percent reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the simplification of licensing procedures for cottonseed samplers, if adopted, would become
effective on July 1, 1994, so that implementation could be coordinated with the start of the 1994 cotton harvest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA provides official grading of cottonseed under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C.
1624), which requires USDA to supervise the drawing, preparation, and handling of samples submitted for official
grading. Current regulations require that applications for initial and renewal cottonseed sampler's licenses,
both of which expire in 1 year, be accompanied by proof that the sampler is bonded by an approved surety company, including
a power of attorney, and a small fee ($20.00 for new licenses and $18.00 for renewals). These requirements are unnecessary
for the maintenance of an acceptable level of supervision of cottonseed sampling by USDA. In addition, the licensing
process would be simplified if these requirements were eliminated and the license period extended to 5 years. The
licensing procedures for cotton samplers were revised similarly 15 years ago with no adverse effects to the level
of supervision provided by AMS, and this revision would make the procedures for cottonseed sampler licensing consistent
with those for cotton samplers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, official cottonseed samplers would still be required to obtain a license, and sampling
equipment and procedures would continue to receive the same level of supervision from Agricultural Marketing Service,
Cotton Division personnel. The expected effects of this proposed revision would be to: (1) Decrease both the applicant's
expense and paperwork burden required for licensing; and (2) simplify the procedures and reduce the time required
by the Cotton Division employees to process the applications and maintain license records. While the effects on the
cottonseed industry are expected to be nominal in both cases, justification for continuing the bonding requirement,
license fee, and 1-year license period cannot be supported by experience in the supervision of USDA's official cottonseed
grading program in recent years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, &sect;&sect;61.26 and 61.28, which detail the bonding requirements for both newly issued and renewal
cottonseed sampling licenses, would be deleted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;61.27, the period of new and renewal licenses would be extended from 1 to 5 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 61.29 and 61.43, which set forth the designation of bond approval authority and the fees for new and renewal
licenses, respectively, would be deleted.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document invites written comments on a proposal to suspend certain provisions of the Southwest Plains Federal
milk marketing order (Order 106) for the months of February 1994 through August 1996. The proposal would suspend a
portion of the supply plant shipping requirement and the touch-base requirement during the months of February through
August of each year. The action was requested by Kraft General Foods (Kraft), which contends the suspension is necessary
to prevent the uneconomical and inefficient movement of milk and to ensure that producers historically associated
with the market will continue to have their milk pooled under Order 106.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this proposed action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Such action would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy
farmers would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from
such pricing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed suspension has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not
intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings
must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to
an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation
imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted
from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary
would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the
handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's
ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, suspension
of the following provisions of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Southwest Plains marketing area is
being considered for the months of February through August of 1994 through 1996, effective upon publication in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All persons who wish to send written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies
of them to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington,
DC 20090&hyph;6456, by the 7th day after publication of this notice in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The period for filing comments is limited to 7 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete
the required procedures before the requested suspension is to be effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments that are sent will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during normal business
hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).

Statement of Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed suspension would suspend the requirement that producers ``touch-base'' at a pool plant with at least
one day's production during the month before their milk is eligible for diversion to a nonpool plant. By suspending
the touch-base provision, producer milk would not be required to be delivered to pool plants before going to unregulated
manufacturing plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed suspension would allow a supply plant that has been associated with the Southwest Plains
order during the months of September through January of each year to qualify as a pool plant without shipping any milk
to a pool distributing plant during the following months of February through August. Without the suspension, a supply
plant would be required to ship 20 percent of its producer receipts to pool distributing plants to qualify as a pool
plant during each of the months of February through August.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Kraft's letter requesting the suspension, supplemental milk supplies will not be needed to meet the
fluid needs of distributing plants. Kraft anticipates that there will be an adequate supply of direct-ship producer
milk located in the general area of distributing plants available to meet the Class I needs of the market. Consequently,
it states, there is no need to require producers located some distance from pool distributing plants to touch-base
when their milk can more economically be diverted directly to manufacturing plants in the production area.

This proposed rule deals primarily with requirements imposed upon foreign governments and non-profit entities
distributing relief supplies overseas. Therefore, the proposed rule does not have a significant impact upon a substantial
number of small business entities and Regulatory Impact Statement was not prepared. A copy of this proposed rule has
been sent to the Chief Counsel, Office of Advocacy, U.S. Small Business Administration.

As required by Section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, FAS has submitted a copy of this proposed rule
to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring
to submit comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspects of these information collection requirements,
including suggestions for reducing the burdens, should direct them to the Acting General Sales Manager, FAS, USDA,
at the address above, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, New Executive Building, Washington,
DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for the Foreign Agricultural Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with state and local officials. See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 46 FR 29115 (June 24,
1983). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under the Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. The proposed rule would
have pre-emptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations, or policies which conflict with such
provisions or which otherwise impede their full implementation. The proposed rule would not have retroactive effect.
Administrative proceedings are not required before parties may seek judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Agriculture is committed to carrying out its statutory and regulatory mandates in a manner that
best serves the public interest. Therefore, where legal discretion permits, the Department actively seeks to promulgate
regulations that promote economic growth, create jobs, are minimally burdensome and are easy for the public to understand,
use or comply with. In short, the Department is committed to issuing regulations that maximize net benefits to society
and minimize costs imposed by those regulations. This principle is articulated in Executive Orders 12291 and 12498.
The Department applies this principle to the full extent possible, consistent with law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has developed and reviewed this regulatory proposal in accordance with these principles. Nonetheless,
the Department believes that public input from all interested persons can be invaluable to ensuring that the final
regulatory product is minimally burdensome and maximally efficient. Therefore, the Department specifically seeks
comments and suggestions from the public regarding any less burdensome or more efficient alternative that would
accomplish the purposes described in the proposal. Comments suggesting less burdensome or more efficient alternatives
should be addressed to the agency as provided in this Proposed Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would govern the donation of agricultural commodities overseas pursuant to section 416(b) of
the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1431(b)) and the Food for Progress Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. 1736o). These regulations
contain many provisions that have been standard terms of agreements with recipients, i.e., Cooperating Sponsors,
for a number of years. As of October 1, 1991, the Agency for International Development no longer is a signatory to section
416(b) program agreements and pursuant to E.O. 12752, 56 FR 8255, the Secretary of Agriculture was delegated the President's
responsibilities under the Food for Progress Act. Accordingly, it is appropriate for the Department of Agriculture
to promulgate regulations to govern operations under these two programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, the regulatory provisions herein would apply equally to both programs; however, certain provisions
dealing with the sale of commodities and the use of local currencies generated from such sales apply only to the section
416(b) program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties should carefully read the full proposed rule. Of particular note are the following points: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Nominations of shipping agents for Cooperating Sponsors participating in the Food for Progress Act will be made
to USDA in conformity with the conflict of interest provisions currently applicable only to section 416(b) and of
the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Pub. L. 480). This will place all USDA concessional
export programs on the same basis regarding conflict of interest reviews in connection with shipping agents. In this
regard, the proposed regulations include limitations on commissions that may be paid to shipping agents that follow
the limitations currently proposed for shipping agents participating in the title I, Public Law 480 program. See
57 FR 53607, November 12, 1992. Comments received regarding these limitations are presently being reviewed and will
also be considered in relation to this proposed rule. These proposed rules, however, would also limit the agents commission
to a percentage of the gross freight attributable to the ocean segment of any movement that may be contracted on a through
bill of lading or involve obligations at discharge such as bagging grain. This limitation is included because freight
charges attributed to inland movements to many destinations receiving section 416(b) and Food for Progress commodities
are relatively high due to various difficult conditions in these countries. CCC does not have an effective mechanism
to determine the reasonableness of these charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. These regulations apply only to agreements for the donation of agricultural commodities and not to any sales to
Cooperating Sponsors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Specific criteria are established to govern the approval of agreements or of activities under such agreements.
Detailed information is required in the Plan of Operation submitted in connection with a section 416(b) agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The proposed rule contains detailed procedures for the procurement of ocean transportation including requirements
for competitive bidding in the fixture of vessels on charter terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The regulations include specific guidance for ocean carrier and inland claims and for disposing of commodities
unfit for intended use. In this regard, the regulations would adopt procedures similar to those in effect for title
II, Public Law 480 shipments and should be familiar to many Cooperating Sponsors.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This part contains the general terms governing agreements between CCC and Cooperating Sponsors providing for the
donation of agricultural commodities to carry out programs of assistance outside the United States under the authority
of section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, or support of developing countries and countries that have made
commitments to introduce or expand free enterprise elements in their agricultural economies under the authority
of the Food for Progress Act of 1985. Program Agreements may contain other provisions when CCC determines that such
provisions are necessary to effectively carry out a particular Program Agreement. Except as otherwise specified
herein, these regulations apply to only donations to Cooperating Sponsors under both the section 416(b) and Food
for Progress programs. However, these regulations do not apply to donations to intergovernmental agencies (such
as the World Food Program) or organizations unless CCC and such intergovernmental agency or organization enters
into a Program Agreement incorporating this part.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall bear all costs and expenses incurred subsequent to the transfer of title, except
that, when specifically provided in the Program Agreement or upon the determination by CCC that it is the best interest
of the program to do so, CCC may pay or make reimbursement for all or a portion of the reasonable transportation costs

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) (i) In the case of countries receiving commodities under the Food for Progress Program, CCC may agree to make payments
to Cooperating Sponsors to assist in the administration, sale, and monitoring of food assistance programs to strengthen
private sector agriculture in such countries. The Program Agreement will specify the maximum dollar amount of funding
that CCC will pay the Cooperating Sponsor for such costs. Payment of the above funds will only be made to the Cooperating
Sponsor in such amounts, and for such purposes, as may be specifically approved in writing by the Controller, CCC and
the General Sales Manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) CCC may, at its option, advance to the Cooperating Sponsor not more than 85 percent of the total dollar amount specified

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) The Cooperating Sponsor must submit to the Controller, CCC, invoices supporting the charges incurred against
the advance, or for which reimbursement is claimed, within 60 days from the date the service is received. All charges
must be reasonable and foreign currency transactions must be supported by evidence of the specific exchange rate
incurred. A delay in receipt, or non-receipt, of supporting documentation by the Controller, CCC, may result in CCC's
refusal to release future advances. The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly refund to CCC all funds advanced, together
with all interest earned on such funds, if either not utilized within 180 days after the advance for purposes for which
the funds were advanced, or for which documentation supporting the expenditure is not supplied to CCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) All CCC advances must be deposited in an interest bearing account with interest earned on the funds advanced used

(4) If the Program Agreement specifies that CCC will finance only the ocean freight differential (``OFD'') on U.S.
flag vessels, the Director, Public Law 480&hyph;OD will compute OFD as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) when non-U.S.-flag vessels are offered, the OFD will be the difference between the weighted average freight rate(s)
of non-U.S. flag vessel(s) fixed or offered that could carry the quantity of cargo absent the requirement to use U.S.-flag
vessels, and the rate for the U.S. flag vessel(s) fixed; or the rate(s) offered (including any lower rates negotiated)
by U.S.-flag vessels(s) which could have carried the required tonnage and represents the lowest land cost (U.S. flag
basis).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When non U.S. flag vessels are not offered, or when offered, have specifications which preclude their use, the
rate to be used in computing OFD will be determined by using any market data deemed relevant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When the recipient country employs its own flag vessels or other flag vessels under its control, the non-U.S.
flag rate to be used in computing OFD will be determined using any market data deemed relevant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In the case of shipments of bulk commodities, the Cooperating Sponsor shall open offers in public in the United

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Director, Public Law 480&hyph;OD, or another official specified in the Program Agreement, must approve all
vessel fixtures. The Cooperating Sponsor may fix vessels subject to that approval of the Director, Public Law 480&hyph;OD,

480&hyph;OD, or such other official, advises the Cooperating Sponsor of the required approval and the results of
the Maritime Administration's guideline rate review. The Cooperating Sponsor shall not request guideline rate
advice from the Maritime Administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Total commissions earned on U.S. and foreign flag bookings by all parties arranging vessel fixtures, when any

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contract terms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall assure that, when CCC is paying any portion of the ocean freight, charter parties
and liner booking contracts contain clauses that implement the following paragraphs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) packaged commodities on liner vessels shall be shipped on the basis of full berth terms with no demurrage or despatch;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) bulk commodities shall be shipped on the basis of vessel load, free out, with demurrage and despatch applicable
at load and discharge ports. Laytime accounts are to be settled between the ocean carrier and export elevators at load
port and between the ocean carrier and charterers at discharge ports. CCC is not responsible for resolving disputes
involving the calculation of laytime or the payment of demurrage or despatch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) if the Program Agreement requires the Cooperating Sponsor to open an irrevocable letter of credit for ocean
freight, the Cooperating Sponsor shall be liable for detention of the vessel for loading delays attributable solely
to the decision of the ocean carrier not to commence loading because of the failure of the Cooperating Sponsor to establish
such letter of credit. Charter parties and liner booking contracts may not contain a specified detention rate. The
ocean carrier shall be entitled to reimbursement, as damages for detention, all time so lost, for each calendar day
or any part of the calendar day, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. The period of such delay shall not commence
earlier than upon presentation of the vessel at the designated loading port within the laydays specified in the charter
party or liner booking contract, and upon notification of the vessel's readiness to load in accordance with the terms
of the applicable charter party or liner booking contract. The period of such delay shall end at the time that operable
irrevocable letters of credit have been established for ocean freight or the time the vessel begins loading, whichever
is earlier. Time calculated as detention shall not count as laytime. Reimbursement for such detention shall be payable
no later than upon the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) charges attributable to the failure of the vessel to present before the canceling date including, but not limited
to inspection, fumigation, and carrying charges, will be for the account of the ocean carrier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) ocean freight is earned under a charter party when the vessel and cargo arrive at the first port of discharge, Provided,
That if a force majeure as described in paragraph (f)(3) below prevents the vessels arrival at the first port of discharge,
95% of the ocean freight is payable or, if the charter party provides for completing additional requirements after
discharge such as bagging, stacking, or inland transportation, 85% of the ocean freight is payable, at the time the
General Sales Manager determines that such force majeure was the cause of nonarrival; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) when the ocean carrier offers delivery to destination ports on U.S.-flag vessels, but foreign-flag vessels
are used for any part of the voyage to the destination port, without first obtaining the approval of the Cooperating
Sponsor, KCCO, and any other approval that may be required by the Program Agreement, the ocean freight rate will be
reduced to the lowest responsive foreign-flag vessel rate offered in response to the same invitation for bids and
the carrier agrees to pay CCC the difference between the contracted ocean freight rate and the freight rate offered
by such foreign-flag vessel.

Freight Payment by CCC.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When the Program Agreement provides that CCC will pay any portion of the ocean freight:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 100% of the ocean freight is payable upon receipt of the documents specified in paragraph (g) of this section, unless
the charter party or liner booking note provides for completing additional requirements after discharge such as
bagging, stacking, or inland transportation, in which case 85% of the ocean freight is payable. The balance of freight
remaining will be paid upon receipt of notification from the Cooperating Sponsor that the vessel has fulfilled all
the requirements of the charter party or liner booking contract in a successful manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Demurrage will not be paid or reimbursed by CCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) CCC will waive the requirement in paragraph (g) of this section for a notice of arrival if the General Sales Manager
determines upon submission of evidence on the part of the ocean carrier that the vessel is lost or unable to proceed
to destination after completion of loading as a result of one or more of the following causes (force majeure): Damage
caused by perils of the sea or other waters; collisions; wrecks; stranding without the fault of the carrier; jettison;
fire from any cause; Act of God; public enemies or pirates; arrest or restraint of princes, rulers, or peoples without
the fault of the ocean carrier; wars; public disorders; captures; or detention of public authority in the interest
of public safety. If the General sales Manager determines that a force majeure prevents the vessels arrival at the
first port of discharge, 95% of the ocean freight is payable or, if the charter party provides for completing additional
requirements after discharge such as bagging, stacking, or inland transportation, 85% of the ocean freight is payable
upon submission of the documents specified in paragraph (g) of this section, except that the notice of arrival need
not be submitted. The balance of ocean freight shall not be due or payable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

where it determines that such an agreement is not feasible or appropriate for any reason, including the nature of the
recipient agency, or the amount of commodities, monetized proceeds or program income that may be transferred to the
recipient agency. In any case where waiver is granted, however, such waiver shall not otherwise affect or diminish
the Cooperating Sponsor's obligations or responsibilities with respect to program commodities, monetized proceeds
or program income.

(a) Section 416(b). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, commodities donated under a section 416(b) Program Agreement
may be sold or bartered only in accordance with an approved Plan of Operation. Such sales or barters may be approved
by CCC on a case-by-case basis for the following purposes only:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) to finance the distribution, handling or processing costs of the donated commodities in the importing country
or in a country through which the commodities must be transshipped, or other activities in the importing country that
are consistent with providing food assistance to needy people;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) in the case of sales of commodities furnished to nonprofit and voluntary agencies, or cooperatives, to generate
proceeds to be used to transport, store, distribute and otherwise enhance the effectiveness of the use of commodities,
and to implement income generating community development, health, nutrition, cooperative development, agricultural
program, and other development activities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) to cover expenses of the type identified in section 406 of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance
Act of 1954; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) for any other use specifically authorized by statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Commodities may be sold or bartered only in the importing country or other country specifically approved by CCC.
Monetized proceeds must be expended within either the country of origin or in other countries as necessary to expedite
transportation of commodities, or in countries which generally accept the type of currency generated by the sale.
Monetized proceeds must be expended within one year of acquisition unless CCC specifically agrees that a longer period
is necessary to achieve the purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, commodities may be sold or bartered without prior
approval of CCC where damage has occurred to the commodity rendering it unfit for the intended program purposes, and
sale or barter is necessary to mitigate the loss of the value of the damaged commodity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Cooperating Sponsors who sell or barter commodities must enter into a written agreement with the other party to
the sale transaction. A copy of the executed agreement must be provided to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) All monetized proceeds shall be deposited into a special interest bearing account for control and monitoring
unless interest bearing accounts are prohibited by the laws or customs of the importing country or such requirement
would impose an undue burden on the Cooperating Sponsor. Any accrued interest shall be used only for approved activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Cooperating Sponsors shall not be required to monitor, manage, report on, or account for the distribution or use
of such sold or bartered commodities after all sales proceeds have been fully deposited in a special account and title
to the commodities has passed to buyers or other third parties pursuant to a sale or barter transaction. The sales proceeds
and the uses thereof, however, must be monitored, managed, reported and accounted for as provided in the relevant
sections of this part 1499.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(7) Commodities approved for sale or barter need not be imported and sold free of all duties and taxes, but nongovernmental
Cooperating Sponsors may negotiate agreements with the host government permitting the duty and tax-free import
and sale of such commodities. Even where the Cooperating Sponsor negotiates such exempt status, the prices at which
the Cooperating Sponsor sells the commodities to the purchaser shall reflect prices that would be obtained in a competitive
commercial transaction, i.e., the prices would include the cost of duties and taxes, so that the amounts normally
paid for duties and taxes would accrue for the benefit of the Cooperating Sponsor's approved program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) No part of the proceeds or services realized from sales or barters may be used for operating and overhead expenses,
other than for personnel and administrative costs of local cooperatives. Operating and overhead expenses are costs
attributable to the overall administration and management expenses of the Cooperating Sponsor in its regional,
national, or U.S. offices, including rent, taxes, insurance, utilities, telephone, office supplies, and depreciation,
and in the case of nonprofit private and voluntary agencies and cooperatives, costs of monitoring, evaluation, auditing,
and travel within the host country except where such costs are directly related to a specific activity and essential
to the effective implementation of the activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The Cooperating Sponsor shall use commercially reasonable procurement practices in purchasing goods or services
and in construction activities using monetization proceeds or program income, and shall employ procedures that
prevent fraud, self-dealing, and conflicts of interest and provide for free and open competition to the maximum extent
practicable. Title to real and personal property acquired with monetization proceeds and program income shall be
vested in the Cooperating Sponsor, with the Cooperating Sponsor providing the Controller, CCC with an inventory
list of all assets valued at one thousand dollars (USD) or more. The Cooperating Sponsor shall dispose of such property
as directed by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache in the event the program terminates or is transferred to another
Cooperating Sponsor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Monetized proceeds and program income may not be used to acquire, develop, construct, alter or upgrade land,
buildings or other real property improvements or structures that are either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) owned or managed by a church or other organization engaged exclusively in religious activity, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) used in whole or in part for sectarian purposes. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, monetized proceeds
or program income may be used to finance repair or rehabilitation of an existing structure owned or managed by a church
or organization engaged exclusively in religious activity to the extent necessary to avoid spoilage or loss of donated
commodities, provided that the structure is not used in whole or in part for any sectarian purpose while donated commodities
are stored in it. The use of monetized proceeds or program income to finance construction of such a structure may be
approved in the operational plan or by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache if the structure is needed and will be
used for the storage of donated commodities for a sufficient period of time to warrant the expenditure of monetized
proceeds or program income and the structure will not be used for any sectarian purpose during this period.

for inspection by a public health official or other competent authority. A nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsor
shall arrange for such inspection of commodities damaged prior to delivery. If the commodity is determined to be unfit
for the use authorized in the Program Agreement, the commodities shall be disposed of in accordance with the priority
set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Expenses incidental to the handling and disposition of the damaged commodity
shall be paid by CCC from the sales proceeds or from an appropriate CCC account as determined by CCC. The net proceeds
of sales shall be deposited with the U.S. Disbursing Officer American Embassy, for the credit of CCC in an appropriate
CCC account as determined by CCC. However, if the commodities were donated for monetization programs, the net sales
proceeds, after deducting expenses incidental to handling and disposition of the damaged commodity, shall be deposited
to the special account established for monetized proceeds, and the Cooperating Sponsor is responsible for documenting
the amount of the sales proceeds from the sale of damaged commodities deposited to the special account. The Cooperating

If after arrival in a foreign country it appears that the commodity, or any part thereof, may be unfit for the use authorized
in the Program Agreement, the Cooperating Sponsor shall immediately arrange for inspection of the commodity by a
public health official or other competent authority approved by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. If no competent
local authority is available, the Agricultural Counselor or Attache may determine whether the commodities are unfit
for the use authorized in the Program Agreement, and, if so, may direct disposal in accordance with paragraphs (b)
(1) through (4) of this section. The Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange for the recovery for authorized use of that
part designated during the inspection as suitable for authorized use. If, after inspection, the commodity (or any
part thereof) is determined to be unfit for authorized use, the Cooperating Sponsor shall notify the Agricultural
Counselor or Attache of the circumstances pertaining to the loss or damage. With the concurrence of the Agricultural
Counselor or Attache, the commodity determined to be unfit for authorized use shall be disposed of in the following
order of priority:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) By transfer to an approved section 416(b) program for use as livestock feeding feed. CCC shall be advised promptly
of any such transfer so that shipments from the United States to the livestock feeding program can be reduced by an equivalent
amount;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Sale for the most appropriate use, i.e., animal feed, fertilizer, or industrial use, at the highest obtainable
price. When the commodity is sold, all U.S. Government markings shall be obliterated or removed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) By donation to a governmental or charitable organization for use as animal feed or for other non-food use; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the commodity is unfit for any use or if disposal in accordance with paragraph (b)(1), (2) or (3) of this section
is not possible, the commodity shall be destroyed under the observation of a representative of the Agricultural Counselor
or Attache, if practicable, in such manner as to prevent its use for any purpose.

in effecting any sale may be deducted from the sales proceeds and, except for monetization programs, the net proceeds
shall be deposited with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, with instructions to credit the deposit to
an appropriate CCC account as determined by CCC. In monetization programs, the gross proceeds shall be deposited

Survey and outturn reports. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Unless the Program Agreement provides otherwise, CCC shall arrange for an independent cargo surveyor to attend
the discharge of the cargo and to report on the quantity and condition of the commodities discharged and the probable
cause of any damage. All cargoes provided under an agreement shall be surveyed. If practicable, the examination of
the cargo shall be conducted jointly by the surveyor, the consignee, and the ocean carrier, and the survey report shall
be signed by all parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (i) If the Cooperating Sponsor arranges for an independent cargo surveyor, the Cooperating Sponsor shall obtain
a certification by a public health official or similar competent authority as to the condition of the commodity in
any case where a damaged commodity appears to be unfit for the use authorized in the Program Agreement; and a certificate
of disposition in the event the commodity is determined to be unfit for its intended use. Such certificates shall be
obtained as soon as possible after discharge of the cargo. The Cooperating Sponsor shall forward any narrative chronology
or other commentary it can provide to assist in the adjudication of ocean transportation claims and shall prepare
such a narrative in any case where the loss is estimated to be in excess of $5,000.00. The Cooperating Sponsor may, at
its option, also engage the independent surveyor to supervise clearance and delivery of the cargo from customs or
port areas to the Cooperating Sponsor or its agent and to issue delivery survey reports thereon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the event of cargo loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor shall provide the names and addresses of individuals
who were present at the time of discharge and during survey and who can verify the quantity lost or damaged. For bulk
grain shipments, in those cases where the Cooperating Sponsor is responsible for survey and outturn reports, the
Cooperating Sponsor shall obtain the services of an independent surveyor to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Observe the discharge of the cargo and report on discharging methods including scale type, calibrations and any
other factor which may affect the accuracy of scale weights, and if scales are not used, the reason should be stated
and the method of weight determination fully described; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Estimate the quantity of cargo, if any, lost during discharge through carrier negligence; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Advise on the quality of sweepings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Obtain copies of port or vessel records, if possible, showing quantity discharged; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Provide immediate notification to the Cooperating Sponsor if additional services are necessary to protect cargo
interests of if surveyor has reason to believe that the correct quantity was not discharged. In the case of shipments
arriving in container vans, Cooperating Sponsors shall require the independent surveyor to list the container van
numbers and seal numbers shown on the container vans, and indicate whether the seals were intact at the time the container
vans were opened, and whether the container vans were in any way damaged. To the extent possible, the independent surveyor
should observe discharge of container vans from the vessel to ascertain whether any damage to the container van occurred
and arrange for surveying the contents as soon as possible after opening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Cooperating Sponsors shall send copies to KCFMO, Chief, Debt Management Office of all reports and documents
pertaining to the discharge of commodities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) CCC will reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for incurred costs upon receipt of the survey report and the surveyor's
invoice or other documents that establish the survey cost. CCC shall not reimburse a Cooperating Sponsor for the costs
of only a delivery survey, in the absence of a discharge survey, or for any other survey not taken contemporaneously
with the discharge of the vessel, unless such deviation is justified to the satisfaction of CCC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Survey contracts shall be let on a competitive bid basis unless CCC determines that the use of competitive bids
would not be practicable. CCC may preclude the use of certain surveyors because of conflicts of interest or lack of
demonstrated capability to properly carry out surveying responsibilities.

Ocean carrier loss and damage. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Notwithstanding transfer of title to the Cooperating Sponsor, the CCC shall have the right to file, pursue, and
retain the proceeds of collection from claims arising from ocean transportation cargo loss and damage, including
loss and damage occurring between the time of transfer of title and loading aboard a vessel. CCC assumes general average
contributions and all valid general average incidents which may arise from the movement of commodity to the destination
ports. CCC shall receive and retain all allowances in general average. Where the Cooperating Sponsor pays the ocean
freight or a portion thereof, it shall be entitled to pro rata reimbursement received from any claims related to ocean
freight charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall: File notice with the ocean carrier immediately upon discovery of any cargo loss
or damage, promptly initiate claims against the ocean carriers for such loss and damage, take all necessary action
to obtain restitution for losses, and provide CCC copies of all such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cooperating
Sponsors need not file a claim when the cargo loss is less than $100, or in any case when the loss is between $100 and $300
and the Cooperating Sponsors determine that the cost of filing and collecting the claim will exceed the amount of the
claim. Cooperating Sponsors shall transmit to KCFMO, Chief, Debt Management Office information and documentation
on such lost or damaged shipments when no claim is to be filed. When General Average has been declared, Cooperating
Sponsors need not file or collect claims for loss of, or damage to, commodities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Amounts collected by Cooperating Sponsors on claims against ocean carriers which are less than $200 may be retained
by the Cooperating Sponsor. On claims involving loss of damage of $200 or more the Cooperating Sponsors may retain
from collections received by them, either $200 plus 10 percent of the difference between $200 and the total amount
collected on the claim, up to a maximum of $500; or the actual administrative expenses incurred in collection of the
claim, provided retention of such administrative expenses is approved by CCC. Allowable collection costs shall
not to include attorneys fees, fees of collection agencies, and similar costs. In no event will CCC pay collection
costs in excess of the amount collected on the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Cooperating Sponsors also may retain from claim recoveries remaining after allowable deductions for administrative
expenses of collection, the amount of any special charges, such as handling and packing costs, which the Cooperating
Sponsor has incurred on the lost or damaged commodity and which are included in the claims and paid by the liable party.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) The Cooperating Sponsor may redetermine claims on the basis of additional documentation or information not considered
when the claims were originally filed when such documentation or information clearly changes the ocean carrier's
liability. Approval of such changes by CCC is not required regardless of amount. However, copies of redetermined
claims and supporting documentation or information shall be furnished to CCC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The Cooperating Sponsor may negotiate compromise settlements of claims of any amount, provided that proposed
compromise settlements of claims having a value of $5,000 or more shall require prior approved in writing by CCC. When
a claim is compromised, the Cooperating Sponsor may retain from the amount collected, the amounts authorized in paragraph
(d)(3) of this section, and in addition, an amount representing such percentage of the special charges described
in paragraph (d)(4) of this section as compromised amount is to the full amount of the claim. When a claim is less than
$600, the Cooperating Sponsor may terminate collection activity when it is determined that pursuit of such claims
will not be economically sound. Approval for such termination by CCC is not required; however, the Cooperating Sponsor
shall notify KCFMO, Chief, Debt Management Division when collection activity on a claim is terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) All amounts collected in excess of the amounts authorized herein to be retained shall be remitted to CCC. For the
purpose of determining the amount to be retained by the Cooperating Sponsor from the proceeds of claims filed against
ocean carriers, the word ``claim'' shall refer to the loss and damage to commodities which are shipped on the same voyage
of the same vessel to the same port destination, irrespective of the kinds of commodities shipped or the number of different
bills of lading issued by the carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If a Cooperating Sponsor is unable to effect collection of a claim or negotiate an acceptable compromise settlement
within the applicable period of limitation or any extension thereof granted in writing by the liable party or parties,
the rights of the Cooperating Sponsor to the claim shall be assigned to CCC in sufficient time to permit the filing of
legal action prior to the expiration of the period of limitation or any extension thereof. Generally, the Cooperating
Sponsor shall assign claim rights to CCC no later than 60 days prior to the expiration of the period of limitation or
any extension thereof. In all cases, the Cooperating Sponsor, shall keep CCC informed of the progress of its collection
efforts and shall promptly assign their claim rights to CCC upon request. Subsequently, if CCC collects on or settles
the claim, CCC shall, except as indicated below, pay to the Cooperating Sponsor the amount to which it would have been
entitled had it collected on the claim. The additional 10 percent on amounts collected in excess of $200 will be payable,
however, only if CCC determines that reasonable efforts were made to collect the claim prior to the assignment, or
if payment is determined to be commensurate with the extra efforts exerted in further documenting the claim. If documentation
requirements have not been fulfilled and the lack of such documentation has not been justified to the satisfaction
of CCC, CCC will deny payment of all allowances to the Cooperating Sponsor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) When a Cooperating Sponsor fails to file a claim, permit a claim to become time-barred, or fail to take timely actions
to insure the right of CCC to assert such claims, and CCC determines that the Cooperating Sponsor failed to properly
exercise its responsibilities under the Agreement, the Cooperating Sponsor shall be liable to the United States
for the cost and freight value of the commodities lost to the program.

commodities of equal value). If the Cooperating Sponsor:

for such payment or replacement if it is determined by CCC that such improper distribution or use, or such loss or damage,
could not have been prevented by proper exercise of the Cooperating Sponsor's responsibility under the terms of the
Program Agreement. Normal commercial practices in the country of distribution shall be considered in determining
whether there was a proper exercise of the Cooperating sponsor's responsibility. Payment by the Cooperating Sponsor
shall be made in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

in the case of landlocked countries, arrange for an independent survey at the point of entry into the recipient country
and make a report as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. CCC will reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for the
costs of survey as set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where any damage to or loss of the commodity or any loss of monetized proceeds or program income is attributable
to a warehouseman, carrier or other person, the Cooperating Sponsor shall make every reasonable effort to pursue
collection of claims for such loss or damage. The Cooperating Sponsor shall furnish a copy of the claim and related
documents to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. Cooperating Sponsors who fail to file or pursue such claims shall
be liable to CCC for the value of the commodities or loss of monetized proceeds or program income is attributable to
a warehouseman, carrier or other person, the Cooperating Sponsor shall make every reasonable effort to pursue collection
of claims for such loss or damage. The Cooperating Sponsor shall furnish a copy of the claim and related documents to
the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. Cooperating Sponsors who fail to file or pursue such claims shall be liable
to CCC for the value of the commodities or monetized proceeds or program income lost, damaged, or misused: Provided,
however, that the Cooperating Sponsor may elect not to file a claim if the loss is less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor
may retain $150 of any amount collected on an individual claim. In addition, Cooperating Sponsors may, with the written
approval of the Agricultural Counselor or Attache, retain amounts to cover special costs of collection such as legal
fees, or pay such collection costs with monetized proceeds or program income. Any proposed settlement for less than
the full amount of the claim requires prior approval by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. When the Cooperating
Sponsor has exhausted all reasonable attempts to collect a claim, it shall request the Agricultural Counselor or
Attache to provide further instructions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) At a minimum, the Cooperating Sponsor shall pursue any claim by initial billings and with three progressively
stronger demands at not more than 30 day intervals. If these efforts fail to elicit a satisfactory response, legal
action in the judicial system of the cooperating country shall be pursued unless:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Liability of the third party is not provable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The cost of pursuing the claim would exceed the amount of the claim,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The third party would not have enough assets to satisfy the claim after a judicial decision favorable to the cooperating
sponsor, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Maintaining legal action in the country's judicial system would seriously impair the Cooperating Sponsor's
ability to conduct an effective program in the country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Cooperating Sponsor's decisions not to take legal action, and reasons therefore, must be submitted in writing to
the Agricultural Counselor or Attache for review and approval, and the Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require
the Cooperating Sponsor to obtain the opinion of competent legal counsel to support its decision. A Cooperating Sponsor
may request approval to terminate legal action after it has commenced for any of the exceptions described above or
if CCC determines that it is otherwise appropriate to terminate legal action prior to judgment. In each instance the
Agricultural Counsel or Attache must provide the Cooperating Sponsor with a written explanation of its decision.
If the Agricultural Counselor or Attache approves a Cooperating Sponsor's decision not to take further action on
the claim for reasons described in paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section, the Cooperating Sponsor shall assign the
claim to CCC and shall provide to CCC all documentation relating to the claim.

Determination of value.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When payment is to be made for commodities misused, lost or damaged, the value shall be determined on the basis of the
domestic market price at the time and place the misuse, loss or damage occurred. When it is not feasible to determine
such market price, the value shall be the f.o.b. or f.a.s. commercial export price of the commodity at the time and place
of export, plus ocean freight charges and other costs incurred by the U.S. Government in making delivery to the Cooperating
Sponsor. When the value is determined on a cost basis, the Cooperating Sponsor may add to the value any provable costs
it has incurred prior to delivery by the ocean carrier. In preparing the claim statement, these costs shall be clearly
segregated from costs incurred by the Government of the United States. With respect to claims other than ocean carrier
loss or damage claims, the value of misused, lost or damaged commodities may be determined on some other justifiable
basis, at the request of the Cooperating Sponsor or upon the recommendation of the Agricultural Counselor or Attache
or CCC designated representative. When replacement is made, the value of commodities misused, lost or damaged shall
be their value at the time and place the misuse, loss, or damage occurred and the value of the replacement commodities
shall be their value at the time and place replacement is made.

 (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly notify the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC designated representative,
in writing, of the circumstances pertaining to any loss, damage, or misuse of commodities valued at $500 or more occurring
within the country of distribution or intermediate country. The report shall be made as soon as the Cooperating Sponsor
has adequately investigated the circumstances, but in no event more than ninety (90) days from the date the loss became
known to the Cooperating Sponsor. The report shall identify the party in possession of the commodities and the party
responsible for the loss, damage or misuse; the kind and quantities of commodities; the size and type of containers;
the time and place of misuse, loss, or damage; the current location of the commodity; the Program Agreement number,
the CCC contract numbers, or if unknown, other identifying numbers printed on the commodity containers; the action
taken by the Cooperating Sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal; and the estimated value of the commodity. The
Cooperating Sponsor shall explain the unavailability of any of the above information. The Cooperating Sponsor shall
also report the details regarding any loss or misuse of monetized proceeds or program income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall report quarterly to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache any loss, damage to or
misuse of commodities resulting in loss of less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor shall inform the Agricultural
Counselor or Attache or CCC designated representative if it has reason to believe there is a pattern or trend in the
loss, damage, or misuse of such commodities and submit a report on the basis described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section
together with such other information as the Cooperating Sponsor has available to it. The Agricultural Counselor
or Attache may require additional information about any commodities lost, damaged or misused if it believes such
information is necessary in order to maintain the integrity of the program.

against Cooperating Sponsors shall be paid to CCC in U.S. dollars. With respect to commodities lost, damaged or misused,
amounts paid by Cooperating Sponsors and third parties in the country of distribution shall be deposited with the
U.S. Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, preferably, in U.S. dollars with instructions to credit the deposit
to an appropriate CCC account as determined by CCC, or in local currency at the official exchange rate applicable to
dollar imports at the time of deposit with instructions to credit the deposit to an appropriate CCC account as determined
by CCC. With respect to monetized proceeds and program income, amounts recovered may be deposited in the same account
as the monetized proceeds and may be used for purposes of the program.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection
regulations to require appeals above the circuit supervisor level that are related to disposition of retained meat
and poultry product to be made in writing; provide that an establishment has 20 calendar days to appeal a retention,
recondition or rework product, or properly dispose of the product; and establish procedures to ensure appropriate
disposition of product immediately after a decision has been reached on an appeal. The proposal also would allow establishments
to accumulate retained product for the purpose of re-examination with specialized detecting equipment provided
written procedures for such activity are approved by the Regional Director. This proposal rule responds to recommendations
from USDA's Office of Inspector General.

This proposed rule is in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule: (1) Would have an effect on the
economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy,
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments
or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned
by another agency; (4) would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or
rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing
any marking or packaging requirements on federally inspected meat or poultry products that are in addition to, or
different than, those imposed under the FMIA and PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent
jurisdiction over meat and poultry products that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing
the distribution of meat and poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA or PPIA, or, in the
case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States. Under
the FMIA and PPIA, States that maintain meat or poultry inspection programs must impose requirements on State inspected
products and establishments that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA and PPIA. These States may, however,
impose more stringent requirements on such State inspected products and establishments.

This proposed rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. There are no applicable administrative procedures
that must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. However, the administrative
procedures specified in Part 335 of Federal meat inspection regulations and Part 381, Subpart W of the poultry products
inspection regulations, must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule, if the challenge
involves any decision of an inspector relating to inspection services provided under the FMIA and PPIA.

Effects on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Administrator, FSIS, has made an initial determination that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposal provides a time limit of 20 calendar days to appeal a
decision to retain meat or poultry products that was made by the in-plant inspector and concurred in by the circuit
supervisor, recondition or rework product, or properly dispose of the product. FSIS has determined that a 20-day
time period provides ample time for the establishment to research and evaluate the situation and make a decision on
whether to recondition or rework the product or request that the product be condemned by the inspector. In addition,
the proposal would require that establishment management make such appeals in writing. The proposal would exempt
establishments from the 20-day time limit for reconditioning and reworking product when establishments intend
to accumulate product for re-examination by mechanical detecting devices. Because of the expense to establishments
of renting mechanical detecting equipment and employing technicians to operate the equipment, some establishments
may elect to store product suspected of being adulterated until a sufficient amount is accumulated to justify the
cost of the detection equipment and technicians. However, the Agency would allow the accumulation of suspect product
beyond the 20 days only if the establishment has written procedures on file that provide information to assure that
the identity, location and security of suspect product is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has determined that the additional paperwork burden associated with this proposed rule is necessary to
maintain control of and assure proper disposition of product that may be adulterated. The Agency has reviewed the
recordkeeping requirements and has determined that they do not impose a significant burden on small entities.

Paperwork Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposal would require that establishments electing to accumulate product for re-examination with mechanical
detection devices submit written procedures to the Regional Director for prior approval. Approval of the written
procedure will be based on the establishment's ability to provide the physical space to store the accumulated product
and its ability to assure that the identity and security of the product is maintained. These procedures would describe
how the establishment will maintain the identity of the suspect product, where the suspect product will be stored,

) require the Secretary of Agriculture to administer an inspection program that assures consumers that meat and poultry
products distributed in commerce are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During processing, there are a number of ways that meat and poultry products may become adulterated or misbranded.
When product is suspected of being adulterated or misbranded, FSIS inspectors place a ``U.S. Retain'' tag on the suspect
product at the time of reinspection at the official establishment and the product is held for further inspection.
Upon further inspection, if the product is found to be adulterated, it is subject to condemnation. However, the inspector
may permit product to be reconditioned or reworked so it will not be misbranded or adulterated under certain conditions
(9 CFR 318.2 and 381.99).

Once product is retained, an establishment must recondition or rework the retained product, properly dispose of
the product, or appeal the inspector's/circuit supervisor's decision to his/her immediate supervisor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, there is no time limit on actions to be taken by the establishment when product is retained by FSIS. At times,
retained product is accumulated from different lots and held in storage for several months or more with no action taken
or planned by the establishment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations are intended to prevent incidents such as one recently investigated by USDA's Office of
Inspector General involving the release of beef trimmings containing plastic shavings from plastic cutting boards.
The investigation disclosed that about 160,000 pounds of beef trimmings containing plastic shavings had been produced
at different times at two different establishments of the same corporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suspect product was retained by FSIS in April and September 1991. FSIS allowed the release of all of the trimmings in
December 1991 after examining a sample of product produced at one of the establishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Inspector General (OIG) provided a report
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 of the investigation to the Secretary of Agriculture on July 30, 1992. Although the investigation disclosed that
FSIS's inspection process ensures a safe and wholesome product, the report recommended, among other things, that
FSIS strengthen its regulations with regard to documenting appeals, providing procedures for reconsidering retention
decisions, and handling and disposition of retained product.

A copy of the report is available from the FSIS Hearing Clerk, Room 3171, South Building, Food Safety and Inspection

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to: (1) Require establishments
to submit written appeals above the circuit supervisor's level when the appeal relates to disposition of retained
meat or poultry product, (2) provide that an establishment has 20 calendar days to: (a) Appeal a retention, (b) recondition
or rework product, or (c) properly dispose of the product, and (3) establish procedures to ensure appropriate disposition
of product immediately after a decision has been reached on an appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has determined that a 20-day time period provides ample time for the establishment to research and evaluate the
situation and make a decision on whether to recondition or rework the product or request that the product be condemned
by the inspector. The time limit would not apply, however, for retained product that is accumulated for re-examination
using mechanical detecting devices. Frequently, when contamination (plastic, metal or other foreign material
capable of detection with approved specialized detection equipment) occurs during processing, it is difficult
to visually determine the precise amount of product affected. Therefore, FSIS permits the use of approved mechanical
detection devices, such as X-ray equipment, to be used by establishments to detect such contamination and to salvage
the portions of the product that are not contaminated. The mechanical detection equipment must be approved as prescribed
in &sect;&sect;308.5 and 381.53 of the meat and poultry inspection regulations. Because of the expense to establishments
of renting mechanical detection equipment and employing technicians to operate the equipment, some establishments
may elect to store product suspected of being contaminated until a sufficient amount is accumulated to justify the
cost of the detection equipment and technicians.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, FSIS would allow the accumulation of suspect product beyond 20 calendar days only
if the product is intended for further examination by mechanical detection equipment and only when the establishment
has written procedures on file that provide information to assure that the identity, location and security of suspect
product are maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if the Administrator or his/her designee determines that the establishment's written procedures for accumulating
product are unacceptable, FSIS would not permit the establishment to accumulate suspect product beyond 20 calendar
days and would formally notify the establishment in writing of the basis for this decision. The establishment would
then be afforded an opportunity to modify the procedure in accordance with the formal notification by submitting
a written statement in response to the denial notification. The establishment would also be afforded a right to request
a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the denial. If the establishment requests a hearing and the Administrator
or his/her designee, after review of the answer, determines the initial determination to be correct, he/she would
file the notification, answer and the request for hearing, which shall constitute the complaint and answer in the
proceeding, with the Hearing Clerk of the Department. The proceeding would be conducted in accordance with Rules
of Practice which shall be adopted for this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the footnotes in &sect;&sect;318.2 and 381.145 of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection
regulation would be revised to reflect that the Agency is authorizing field office personnel to develop sampling
plans for specific products.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream
Model 4101 airplanes. This proposal would require installation of new fairlead assemblies and P-clips; inspection
to detect damage of the wiring harness at the wing rear spars; repair or replacement of any damaged wiring harness with
a new wiring harness assembly; and verification of the position of the currently installed P-clips, and repositioning,
if necessary. This proposal is prompted by a report of abrasion of an electrical power cable in the wiring harness at
the wing rear spar. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent abrasion of electrical power cables
in the wiring harnesses at the wing rear spars, which could lead to a dormant failure of emergency fuel and hydraulic
shutoff services.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. The CAA advises that the manufacturer
found an abraded electrical power cable in the wiring harness at the wing rear spar on one airplane. The cause of this
abrasion has been attributed to insufficient clearance between the electrical cable loom and the flap mechanism.
Abrasion of these cables, if not corrected, could result in dormant failure of emergency fuel and hydraulic shutoff
services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream Aircraft Limited has issued Service Bulletin J41&hyph;57&hyph;003, dated October 13, 1993, that describes
procedures for installation of new fairlead assemblies and P-clips; visual inspection to detect damage of the wiring
harnesses at the wing rear spars; verification of the positioning of the currently installed P-clips; and repositioning
of improperly installed P-clips. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require installation of new fairlead assemblies and
P-clips; visual inspection to detect damage of the wiring harnesses at the wing rear spars; verification of the positioning
the of currently installed P-clips, and repositioning improperly installed P-clips. The actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also require that operators repair or replace damaged wiring harnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 12 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,320, or $110 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes
that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44FR
11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reproposing to classify two temporomandibular joint (TMJ) implants, the
Mandibular Condyle Prosthesis and the Glenoid Fossa Prosthesis, into class III (premarket approval). The agency
is issuing this reproposal to reflect the recommendation of the Dental Products Panel with respect to the classification
of these devices. All comments received on the original proposal remain part of the record for this proposal. These
actions are being taken under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), as amended by the Medical Device Amendments
of 1976 (the amendments) and the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (the SMDA).

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The act, as amended by the amendments (Pub. L. 94&hyph;295) and the SMDA (Pub. L. 101&hyph;629), established a comprehensive
system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. Section 513 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c) established
three categories (classes) of devices, depending on the regulatory controls needed to provide reasonable assurance
of their safety and effectiveness. The three categories of devices are: Class I, general controls; class II, special
controls; and class III, premarket approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Devices that were in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 (the amendments) are classified under section 513
of the act after FDA has done the following: (1) Received a recommendation from a device panel (an FDA advisory committee);
(2) published the panel's recommendation for comment, along with a proposed regulation classifying the device;
and (3) published a final regulation classifying the device. A device that is first offered in commercial distribution
after May 28, 1976, and is substantially equivalent to a device classified under this scheme, is also classified into
the same class as the device to which it is substantially equivalent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A device that was not in commercial distribution prior to May 28, 1976, and that is not substantially equivalent to
a preamendments device, is classified by statute into class III without any FDA rulemaking proceedings. The agency
determines whether new devices are substantially equivalent to previously offered devices by means of the premarket
notification procedure in section 510(k) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)) and part 807 of the regulations (21 CFR part
807). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the recommendations of FDA's Dental Device Classification Panel, the agency published a final regulation
classifying 110 preamendments dental devices on August 12, 1987 (52 FR 30082). The TMJ prostheses were inadvertently
omitted from the dental devices considered for reclassification by the panel and the agency. Based upon the recommendations
of the Dental Products Panel, following its April 21, 1989 meeting, FDA proposed on September 18, 1992 (57 FR 43165),
to classify the Interarticular Disc Prosthesis, the Mandibular Condyle Prosthesis, the Glenoid Fossa Prosthesis,
and the Total Temporomandibular Prosthesis into class III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the April 1989 meeting of the Dental Products Panel, the Panel did not make a recommendation regarding the classification
of the glenoid fossa prosthesis or the mandibular condyle prosthesis. The Panel noted, however, that an implanted
glenoid fossa should not be used with a naturally occurring mandibular condyle, and an implanted mandibular condyle
should not be used with a naturally occurring glenoid fossa. At the February 11, 1993 meeting, the Dental Products
Panel recommended that the mandibular condyle prosthesis and the glenoid fossa prosthesis be classified into class
III. Based upon these recommendations, FDA is reproposing the classification of these two devices into class III.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect of classifying a device into class III is to require each manufacturer of the device to submit to FDA a premarket
approval application (PMA) by a date to be set in a future regulation under section 515(b) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(b)).
Each application must include sufficient valid scientific evidence to provide reasonable assurance that the device
is safe and effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its proposed labeling.
PMA's for class III preamendments devices must be submitted within 30 months after final classification, or 90 days
after the agency publishes a final regulation under 21 U.S.C. 360e(b) requiring PMA's for the device, whichever is
later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises manufacturers of the devices being classified that, if the devices are classified into class III, the
agency intends to require PMA's to be filed for these devices at the earliest date allowed under the statute. Therefore,
PMA's (or approved investigational device exemptions) would be required for these devices on the last day of the 30th
month following final classification into class III.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Dental Products Panel, an FDA advisory committee, made the following recommendation regarding the classification
of the glenoid fossa prosthesis:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Identification:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A glenoid fossa prosthesis is a device that is intended to be implanted in the temporomandibular joint to augment a
glenoid fossa, and provide an articulation surface for the head of a naturally occurring mandibular condyle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Recommended classification: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Class III (premarket approval). The Dental Products Panel recommended that premarket approval of the glenoid fossa
prosthesis be high priority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Summary of reasons for recommendation:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Dental Products Panel recommended that the glenoid fossa prosthesis be classified into class III because the
Panel believed that premarket approval is necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness
of the device. The Panel also believed that the device presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury
to the patient and that insufficient information exists to determine that general controls, either alone or in combination
with the special controls applicable to class II devices, are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety
and effectiveness of the device. Therefore, the device should be subject to premarket approval to ensure that each
manufacturer of this device develop sufficient information to provide reasonable assurance that it is safe and effective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Summary of data on which the recommendation is based: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Dental Products Panel based its recommendation on the Panel members' personal knowledge of, and clinical experience
with, the device and presentations by Panel members and interested parties (Ref. 1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Risks to health:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following risks are associated with the glenoid fossa prosthesis: (a) Implant loosening or displacement. The
screws used to anchor the implant may loosen, resulting in implant loosening or displacement causing changes in bite,
difficulty in chewing, limited joint function, and unpredictable wear on implant components (Refs. 2 through 5);
(b) Degenerative changes to the natural articulating surfaces. Implant breakdown may result in erosion or resorption
of the head of the mandibular condyle or the glenoid fossa. The erosion or resorption may result in intense pain, changes
in bite, difficulty in chewing, limited joint function, and perforation into the middle cranial fossa (Refs. 2 through
5); (c) Foreign body reaction. Implant deterioration and migration may result in a foreign body reaction characterized
by multinucleated giant cells (Refs. 2 through 5); (d) Infection. If the implant cannot be properly sterilized, infection
may result; (e) Loss of implant integrity. If the implant materials are unable to withstand mechanical loading, the
implant can be torn, perforated, delaminated, fragmented, fatigued, or fractured, resulting in failure of the device
to function properly (Refs. 2 through 5); (f) Corrosion. If the implant materials are subject to corrosion, toxic
elements may migrate to various parts of the body; (g) Chronic pain. Degenerative changes within the articular surfaces
and components of the temporomandibular joint due to implant breakdown may result in chronic pain (Refs. 2 through
5); (h) Changes to the contralateral joint. Unilateral placement of the implant may result in deleterious effects
to the contralateral joint; and (i) Malocclusion. Placement of the device may produce an improper occlusal relationship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees with the Dental Products Panel's classification recommendation and is proposing that the glenoid fossa
prosthesis be classified into class III (premarket approval). FDA believes that insufficient information exists
to identify the proper materials or design for the glenoid fossa prosthesis. Therefore, FDA is proposing that premarket
approval of the glenoid fossa prosthesis be given high priority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The act requires the agency to classify into class III a device that presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness
or injury unless it determines that premarket approval is not necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety
and effectiveness of the device. FDA believes that the device presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or
injury to the patient if there are not adequate data to ensure the safe and effective use of the device. The agency believes
that general controls, either alone or in combination with the special controls applicable to class II devices, are
insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device.

The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(e)(2) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

V. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the costs and benefits of this proposed rule to classify two TMJ implants into class III in accordance
with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). The proposed rule would not
impose any new requirements. Therefore, FDA concludes that the proposed rule is not a significant rule as defined
by Executive Order 12866. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the proposed
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would revise the conditions for coverage of suppliers of end-stage renal disease services to incorporate
by reference standards for monitoring the quality of water used in dialysis as published by the Association for the
Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) in ``Hemodialysis Systems'' (2nd Edition). It would also update
an existing incorporation by reference to refer to the 1993 edition of AAMI's voluntary guidelines on ``Recommended
Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers''. These standards and guidelines contain recognized benchmarks for high quality
dialysis procedures. Section 1881(b)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act authorizes the Secretary to limit Medicare
payment for ESRD services to facilities meeting the requirements prescribed in regulations.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1881 of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorizes Medicare coverage and payment for the treatment of end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) in approved facilities that provide dialysis and transplantation services to ESRD patients.
The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) grants approval of ESRD facilities after a State survey agency determines
that the facility is in compliance with conditions for coverage of suppliers of ESRD services in 42 CFR part 405, subpart
U. Since their initial publication on June 3, 1976 (41 FR 22502), the conditions for coverage have undergone several
revisions as a result of legislation, as well as operating experience, to reflect evolving medical standards and
techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations contain conditions and standards prescribing the services that must be provided and the qualifications
of staff who provide those services. The decision as to whether a facility complies with a particular condition for
coverage depends on the manner and degree to which the supplier satisfies the various standards within each condition.
A supplier is not in compliance if, after completion of a survey, a State survey agency determines that the supplier
fails to comply with one or more of the standards within the conditions for coverage, and the deficiencies are of such
character as to limit substantially the supplier's capacity to furnish adequate care or to affect adversely the health
and safety of patients.

II. Quality of Water Used in Dialysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our current regulation governing the quality of water used in dialysis at &sect;405.2140(a)(5) requires that water
used for dialysis must be analyzed periodically and treated as necessary to maintain a continuous supply that is biologically
and chemically compatible with acceptable dialysis techniques. Records of test results and equipment maintenance
are maintained at the facility. This standard was developed in 1976 and has never been modified.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State agency surveyors have difficulty measuring facility compliance with the standard due to its lack of specificity.
Surveyors favor a standard that includes specific biological and chemical water purity levels and user monitoring
guidelines that can be applied consistently during each survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water quality is one of the most important aspects of health and safety in dialysis. Contaminants in water used to make
the dialysis solution (dialysate) may cause adverse reactions when they enter the patient's bloodstream. Some chemical
contaminants are not normally harmful when present in usual physiological fluids but can become dangerous if their
concentrations are increased by contaminants in the water used to make dialysate. If water supplies are biologically
or chemically contaminated, such contaminates may be passed into the patient during the dialysis session, leading
to infection or other adverse consequences. Limits on bacterial growth in dialysate are necessary to prevent high
bacterial counts associated with pyrogenic reaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consultation with the Public Health Service and a variety of professionals in the dialysis industry, we have
concluded that establishing specific, measurable standards regarding the quality of water used in dialysis would
better ensure the health and safety of Medicare beneficiaries. We propose to incorporate by reference the water quality
standard approved by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and published in ``Hemodialysis
Systems'' (2nd edition). According to the Public Health Service's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
AAMI standard on water quality is the only standard available, is accepted by the medical community, and is already
utilized by most facilities. We assume that using this water quality standard will reduce patient risk. However,
we specifically solicit public comments on the validity of this assumption. We are also seeking comments on the assumption
that the majority of facilities are already using this standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. AAMI Standard on Hemodialysis Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1992 AAMI standard, ``Hemodialysis Systems,'' reflects the collective expertise of a committee of health care
professionals, in conjunction with device manufacturers and government representatives, to develop a standard
of performance for manufacturers that will, at a minimum, ensure the effective, safe performance of hemodialysis
systems, devices, and related materials. Included in the standard are specific water quality requirements, including
maximum levels of bacteriological and chemical contamination. Additionally, a guideline for the device user, with
specific emphasis on water purity assurance and monitoring, is appended to the standard. The standard is outcome-oriented
in that it stipulates only specific biological and chemical water purity levels and does not restrict the methods
used by facilities to attain and maintain the acceptable levels. We are interested in comments on whether the outcome
measures are appropriate and whether our assumption that most facilities can meet these requirements is reasonable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each AAMI standard or recommended practice is reviewed at least every 5 years. These reviews are required because
of the constant changes in medical technology and to clarify or improve existing guidelines. The AAMI Renal Disease
and Detoxification Committee initiated a thorough review of the standard ``Hemodialysis Systems'' in 1986, recognizing
that the technology of hemodialysis had changed in a number of respects since the standard was originally published
in 1982. Task groups were established in those areas that the committee felt needed most careful review. As a result
of the work of these task groups and of review by the full committee, a proposed revision of the standard was prepared.
(The allowable levels of chemical contaminants in dialysis water were not changed.) Following committee balloting
and public review, the second edition of ``Hemodialysis Systems'' was approved March 16, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because AAMI guidelines represent medically acceptable standards and techniques developed in collaboration with
health professionals and industry representatives, we believe manufacturers and users already have access to,
and are familiar with, the standard. However, ``Hemodialysis Systems'' (2nd Edition) (ANSI/AAMI RD5) may be purchased
from AAMI, 3300 Washington Boulevard, suite 400, Arlington, Virginia 22201&hyph;4598. Upon final approval of the
incorporation by reference, the publication will be available for inspection at the HCFA Information Resource Center,
6325 Security Boulevard, Room G&hyph;10&hyph;A East High Rise Building, Baltimore, MD or the Office of the Federal
Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to adopt the water quality requirements contained in sections 3.2.1_Water Bacteriology and 3.2.2_Maximum
Level of Chemical Contamination, as well as the guidelines for monitoring water purity contained in sections B1 through
B5 of Appendix B of AAMI's standard ``Hemodialysis Systems''. The requirements of these sections are summarized
below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Appendix B outlines the responsibilities of users of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hemodialysis systems to ensure purity of water used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hemodialysis. Sections B1 through B5 delineate committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations with respect to frequency of monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water used in dialysis to ensure that the maximum levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants specified in section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeded. These recommendations include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ The bacteriology of water and dialysate should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampled at least monthly or more frequently to define, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solve, and control problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ The frequency of sampling for chemical contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varies from 3 months to 12 months depending on the method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water treatment. Because chemical contamination can vary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
widely from month to month, monthly testing is recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initially to develop a data base for determining optimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of testing for each facility. When chloramines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are added municipally to the water supply, the water used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare dialysate should be checked for the presence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloramines at least once a day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ Maximum levels of organic chemicals, pesticides, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
herbicides, and radioactive material cannot be specified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present, therefore, frequency of testing for these materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ Frequency of disinfection of the water treatment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disinfection system, dialysis machines, and equipment used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to distribute and prepare dialysate should be determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the results of microbiological monitoring, by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements to meet AAMI standards and/or guidelines, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the manufacturer's recommendations.

IV. Reuse of Hemodialyzers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1881(f)(7) of the Act requires the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish protocols for reuse of hemodialyzers for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities that voluntarily elect to reuse the filters. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process of hemodialysis, the patient's blood is cleansed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of impurities by passing the blood through the filter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(hemodialyzer) of a hemodialysis machine. Various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques exist that allow these filters to be reused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reuse involves cleaning, disinfecting, and preparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposable hemodialysis devices for subsequent use for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same patient. Although the potential exists for adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient outcomes from reuse, reprocessing and reuse of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialyzers are safe when done properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 2, 1987, through a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication (52 FR 36926), final regulations were issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifying the performance requirements for reuse of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hemodialyzers and other dialysis supplies (&sect;405.2150). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 405.2150 requires ESRD facilities reusing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hemodialyzers to meet the voluntary guidelines and standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted by AAMI and issued in July 1986 as ``Recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike AAMI ``standards'' which are directed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, ``recommended practices'' are directed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health professionals and provide guidelines for the use, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care, and processing of a medical device or system. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMI guidelines on reuse of hemodialyzers are based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national consensus of physicians, other health care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals, government representatives, patients, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry. They describe the details of reprocessing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialyzers and address various areas such as personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications and training, patient considerations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, reprocessing supplies, monitoring during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialysis, quality assurance, and quality control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the publication of the 1986 edition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Recommended Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers'' and HCFA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adoption of the recommended practice, users of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines have asked numerous questions. As a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AAMI review of the 1986 guidelines, the Hemodialyzer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reuse Subcommittee of the AAMI Renal Disease and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Detoxification Committee developed a 1993 edition. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcommittee consists of representatives from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing, governmental (including HCFA), physician, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialysis facility, and patient consumer communities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preliminary revisions underwent concurrent public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and committee balloting which lasted 2 months. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final revisions also underwent public review and committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balloting and were approved May 3, 1993. A quorum of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-thirds of the subcommittee was necessary to vote the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document's approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The announcement of the 1993 edition of ``Recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers'' was made in the ``AAMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
News'', the ``American National Standards Institute Reporter'', 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in press releases to 500 trade journals. The 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edition (ANSI/AAMI RD47) may be purchased from AAMI, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3300 Washington Boulevard, suite 400, Arlington, Virginia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22201&hyph;4598. Upon final approval of the incorporation by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference, the 1993 edition will be available for inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the HCFA Information Resource Center, 6325 Security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boulevard, Room G&hyph;10&hyph;A East High Rise Building, Baltimore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MD 21207, or the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 edition is directed to the physician in charge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of hemodialyzer reprocessing by either the manual or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automated method and describes the essential elements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
good practices for reprocessing dialyzers to help assure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device safety and effectiveness. Some of the salient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes included in the document are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;New Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OSHA) recommended environmental exposure limits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Significant simplification and clarification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of validating indirect performance measurements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A new section on equipment safety that recommends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing the function of the reprocessing system after repair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of automated equipment unless a system has an autotest mode; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A definition for ``rebound'' that describes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disinfectant rebound effect; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revisions regarding use, testing, and removal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical germicide and more detailed specifications on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
germicides involved in reuse; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An expanded section on safety monitoring of clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test results; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Several new bibliographical references; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Appendices that list the rationales for the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections and include a new basic formaldehyde assay test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revised requirements for personnel qualifications and

V. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to revise &sect;405.2140(a)(5) to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ESRD facilities meet the AAMI standards on water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and B1&hyph;B5 of Appendix B of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Hemodialysis Systems'' (2nd Edition) which would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated by reference. We would indicate that copies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this publication may be purchased from AAMI and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for inspection at the HCFA Information Resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Center or the Office of the Federal Register. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;405.2150(a)(1), we propose to require ESRD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities reusing hemodialyzers to meet the 1993 edition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AAMI guidelines on ``Recommended Practice for Reuse of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hemodialyzers'' which we propose to incorporate by reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would indicate that copies of the 1993 edition may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchased from AAMI and are available for inspection at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA Information Resource Center or the Office of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Register. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would remove &sect;405.2150(a)(2) concerning staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to chemical germicides, paragraph (a)(3)(iii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning reporting adverse patient reactions to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer; and paragraph (b) concerning the standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialyzer caps. These topics are covered in the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections of the revised 1993 AAMI guidelines which would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated by reference: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

VI. Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the large number of items of correspondence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will consider all comments that we receive by the date and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time specified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this preamble, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if we proceed with the final rule, we will respond to the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains no information collection

requirements. Consequently, this rule need not be reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501

VIII. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of the RFA, all ESRD facilities are considered to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have a significant impact on the operations of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12866 this proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Water Quality Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would incorporate into regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing industry standards on the quality of water used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialysis to enable surveyors to accurately assess a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's compliance with the standard on water quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAMI standards are the result of a collaborative effort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by health professionals and industry representatives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond to clinical needs and to help ensure patient health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety. It is our understanding that AAMI's recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum levels for water contaminants have been clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined and supported by scientific literature and developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through industry consensus. Under the AAMI water standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the supplier/manufacturer of dialysis water treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment is responsible for assuring that the water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced by the system routinely does not exceed the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable chemical contaminant levels. Because AAMI's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable contamination levels have been in effect since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1982 and are recognized as medically acceptable standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we believe that manufacturers have been producing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities purchasing, equipment capable of meeting these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. We understand that technology is in place for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all facilities to meet the AAMI water standard and solicit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on this understanding. While variations in water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality do typically occur, any changes that occur will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handled through consultation with State and local water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorities and safe purity levels ensured through continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring by the physician in charge of dialysis. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants in water used in dialysate may cause adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient reactions, actual documented adverse incidents are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rare when water is monitored properly. Because the AAMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality standard represents long-standing acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical practice, we believe the vast majority of facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already comply with this standard. Incorporation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMI standard into regulations will help ensure patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and safety by providing surveyors with a measurable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard with which they may assess facility compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially in the few facilities that do not voluntarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform to the water quality guidelines adopted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Reuse of Hemodialyzers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AAMI ``Recommended Practice on Reuse'' does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promote either single use or reuse of dialyzers. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines were developed to acknowledge the widespread 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice of reprocessing and provide recommendations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optimal hemodialyzer reprocessing. In January 1993, HCFA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health Standard and Quality Bureau canvassed the 2,345 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare certified ESRD facilities to determine if they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practiced reuse, and if so, the disinfecting protocols used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixty-five percent (1,532) of the facilities reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practicing reuse. Of these facilities, approximately 51 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent use renalin as the germicide, with two-thirds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these facilities using an automated disinfecting system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 40 percent of the facilities reported using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formalin/formaldehyde as the germicide, with manual and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automated systems receiving equal use. Approximately 9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the facilities practicing reuse reported using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glutaraldehyde as the germicide, with the majority of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities using an automated disinfecting system. Less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 1 percent of the facilities use other disinfecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the 1993 AAMI guidelines do not differ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly from the 1986 guidelines (which all Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating facilities practicing reuse already must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet), we believe that the great majority of the facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practicing reuse would be in compliance with the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards proposed in this regulation. The 1993 AAMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards were developed through a public forum and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adoption was well publicized. They reflect the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up-to-date reuse procedures already practiced by many of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, and we do not believe that incorporating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 guidelines into our regulations, in and of itself, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would prompt any facility to begin or discontinue reuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We expect that each facility would respond to these new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards based on the relationship of these standards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its current reuse practices and to factors such as whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or not a facility presently meets the standards or can meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them without extensive changes, and whether or not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility can buy new filters in quantity less expensively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than it can upgrade its reuse practices. As we said above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
65 percent of the facilities are already reusing dialyzers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major effect of this proposed rule would be to assure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Medicare standards for reuse reflect safe and effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because we are unable to predict the decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities would make in response to this regulation, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unable to quantify the potential effect it would have. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries may be reassured that HCFA has adopted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific water quality standards and updated its standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for reuse of hemodialyzers to ensure their health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety. However, we expect that there would be a negligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on most beneficiaries and facilities since we believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these revisions would make no major changes in current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility operation or patient experience. This proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule is not expected to result directly in any increases or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions in Medicare program expenditures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, we have determined, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary certifies that this proposed rule would not have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities and would not have a significant economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operations of a substantial number of small rural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals. Therefore, we are not preparing analyses for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend the VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) to increase the
amount which property holders and management brokers may spend for emergency property repairs. Advance blanket
authorization to management brokers is also being increased. Additionally, the dollar amount that Regional Office
Directors, Loan Guaranty Officers, and Assistant Loan Guaranty Officers are authorized to approve for the repair
of VA property, acquired under Chapter 37, Title 38, United States Code, is being increased to conform with the current
statutory authority.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Purchase of supplies and services for the repair to any VA property is authorized by Chapter 37, Title 38, United States
Code (U.S.C.). The dollar limit for management brokers' blanket advance authority to incur routine charges in connection
with the management of properties acquired by VA under Chapter 37, Title 38, U.S.C., was increased from $75 to $200
in 1981. Since that time, costs associated with services for which management brokers routinely incur expenses have
increased. Because of this, an increase to $500 is being implemented for both the management brokers' blanket authority
to incur expenses and the property holders' emergency repair threshold. Also, because of the increased costs of repairs,
Regional Office Directors, Loan Guaranty Officers, and Assistant Loan Guaranty Officers are authorized to approve
repair programs, (i.e., the aggregate amount of the proposed contracts to purchase supplies and services as contemplated
in a property analysis by the Loan Guaranty activity), where the estimated cost does not exceed $25,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes will further promote the efficient management of VA's acquired property inventory. Additionally,
VAAR Sections 871.103 and 871.106 are being removed because they are duplicative of the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR). Technical amendments are being made to reflect the current organizational titles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that this change will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The increase in the amount
for routine charges or emergency repairs in connection with the management of properties will reduce the economic
burden placed on management brokers or property holders by reducing the administrative approval process. The remaining
proposed changes are VA internal procedures and will not directly affect any small entity.

III. Paperwork Reduction Act

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment does not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements on the public which require

lawfully transfer a handgun to a nonlicensed individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

firearms licensees, and increased license fees for dealers

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this proposed regulation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12866, because the economic effects flow directly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the underlying statute and not from this notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rulemaking. Accordingly, this proposal is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the analysis required by this Executive order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is hereby certified that these proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not have a significant economic impact on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small entities. The revenue effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this rulemaking on small businesses flow directly from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the underlying statute. Likewise, any secondary or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidental effects, and any reporting, recordkeeping, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other compliance burdens flow directly from the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The collection of information contained in this notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on the collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information should be sent to the Office of Management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 1512&hyph;0520, Washington, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DC 20503, with copies to the Chief, Information Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Branch, room 3110, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Firearms, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20226. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection of information in this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation is in 27 CFR 178.130. This information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comply with the provisions of Public Law 103&hyph;159 (107 Stat. 1536). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information will be used to prevent the purchase of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handguns by convicted felons and other persons who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibited by law from receiving or possessing firearms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is the purpose of Public Law 103&hyph;159. The likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondents and recordkeepers are individuals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small businesses. Estimated total annual reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recordkeeping burden: 516,750 hours. Estimated number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of respondents and recordkeepers: 8,213,450. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimated annual frequency of responses: on occasion.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF requests comments on the temporary regulations from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all interested persons. Comments received on or before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closing date will be carefully considered. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received after that date will be given the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration if it is practical to do so, but assurance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration cannot be given except as to comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received on or before the closing date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF will not recognize any material in comments as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidential. Comments may be disclosed to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any material which the commenter considers to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidential or inappropriate for disclosure to the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be included in the comment. The name of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person submitting a comment is not exempt from disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person who desires an opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment orally at a public hearing should submit his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request, in writing, to the Director within the 90-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 5, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its changed circumstances review
concerning its examination of whether Rotem Fertilizers, Ltd. (Rotem) is the successor to Negev Phosphates, Ltd.
(Negev). The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States, Negev, and its merger
with Rotem. We have now completed this review and determine that, for purposes of applying the antidumping duty law,
Rotem is the successor to Negev and, as such, is subject to the revocation which applied to Negev.

 the preliminary results of its antidumping duty changed circumstances review on industrial phosphoric acid from
Israel (58 FR 59010). We have now completed this changed circumstances review in accordance with section 751 of the
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).

Successorship
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In December 1991, Rotem and Negev, two companies within the Israeli Chemicals, Ltd. (ICL) group, merged to become
one corporate entity, Rotem. Subsequent to the merger, Negev was revoked from the antidumping duty order. (See Final
Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Revocation In Part of the Antidumping Duty Order (57 FR 10008;
March 23, 1992).) Before the merger, Rotem was not a producer of the subject merchandise and was never reviewed under
this order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Negev notified the Department in a March 30, 1992 letter that the company had merged with Rotem. The merger, which was
finalized December 31, 1991, was effective retroactively to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1991. During verification, the Department examined Rotem's sales and found no evidence of industrial
phosphoric acid sales prior to the merger. In the March 30, 1992 letter, Negev also identified Rotem as its successor
and requested that the Department issue a determination applying Negev's revocation to Rotem. Rotem began to ship
the subject merchandise to the United States on January 1, 1992. Its shipments have entered under the ``all other''
rate applicable to companies that had never been reviewed under the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that Rotem is the successor to Negev for purposes of applying the antidumping duty law.

Results of Antidumping Duty Changed Circumstances Review, November 5, 1993,

Comment 1:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners argue that the legal test for determining successorship with respect to an antidumping duty order is
that ``the Department will consider the acquiring company to be a successor if its resulting operation is essentially
similar to that of its predecessor.'' Brass Sheet and Strip from Canada: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty
Administrative Review, (57 FR 5128, 5129; February 12, 1992). Petitioners maintain that after the merger, Rotem's
operation was not essentially similar to either that of Rotem or the former Negev because, after the merger, Rotem
became a fully integrated producer of both fertilizer and industrial grade acid, as well as a producer of rock phosphate.
Thus, the newly merged operations of Rotem constitute a company with a more integrated and expanded phosphoric acid
production.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners also claim that in the preliminary results of the changed circumstances review, the Department failed
to consider Rotem as a new business entity because the Department was only looking at industrial phosphoric acid.
Petitioners argue that the proper legal standard for determining successorship is whether the ``resulting operation''
of the acquiring company is essentially similar to its predecessor.'' See Brass Sheet and Strip preliminary results.
Therefore, the merged Rotem should be examined with respect to its overall operations, not just its operations with
respect to the subject merchandise. Petitioners argue that since Rotem's operations are not the same as they were
prior to the merger with respect to all types of merchandise, Rotem should not be treated as a successor to Negev. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to petitioners' argument that Rotem has become an integrated producer of phosphoric acid, respondent
claims that Negev's production of the subject merchandise was in fact fully integrated before the merger. Although
the merger further integrated the production of fertilizer grade acid, no changes have occurred with regard to the
production of the subject merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree with petitioners' assertion that the proper legal standard for determining successorship is whether
the acquiring company is similar to its predecessor with respect to its overall operations. In the preliminary results
for Brass Sheet and Strip, the Department found that ``concerning production and sales of brass sheet and strip,''
the acquiring company was operating essentially as the same business entity as its predecessor. See Brass Sheet and
Strip from Canada; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, (57 FR 5128, 5129; February 12,
1992). Moreover, in the final results for Brass Sheet and Strip, the Department agreed that since respondent's business
operation was essentially the same as that of its predecessor ``with regard to the production of brass sheet and strip,''
the acquiring company was essentially the same operation as its predecessor. See Brass Sheet and Strip from Canada;
Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, (57 FR 20460, 20462; May 13, 1992). Thus, in this review,
the Department has applied the same standard for determining successorship as the standard which was applied in the
preliminary and final results of Brass Sheet and Strip. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Insofar as no explicit legal standard for determining successorship is provided by the statute or the Department's
regulations, the Department has discretion in deciding how to determine whether one company is a successor to another
for purposes of the antidumping duty law. In Brass Sheet and Strip, the Department examined the described factors
in terms of the operations which produce the subject merchandise. This has continued to be our approach in the instant
review. The operation producing the subject merchandise is the appropriate level at which to focus our analysis because
under the antidumping duty laws, we are examining pricing practices with respect to the subject merchandise. For
example, in this case, the antidumping duty order applies only to industrial phosphoric acid and reviews are conducted
only on sales of this merchandise. Thus it follows that an inquiry into the validity of a claim of successorship to a
respondent company should focus on that company's sales and production of the merchandise encompassed by the order.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners claim that when examining the four elements for determining successorship: (1) Management, (2) production
facilities, (3) supplier relationships, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) customer base, Rotem's operations are not a continuation of Negev's operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to management, petitioners argue that with the resulting changes in the board of directors and the production
management, there is a new and different management team in charge. Petitioners claim that there has not been a continuation
of the former Negev management in the new Rotem.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners also claim that since Rotem acquired Negev's production facilities, Rotem's total production facilities
are much more extensive than Negev's were. As a result of the merger, Rotem is a larger full-service phosphate and related
products producer and is not the same company that Negev was before the merger. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners further maintain that supplier relationships have also changed as a result of the merger. The former
Negev obtained important raw material inputs from Rotem, which was then a separate company. Since the merger, raw
material input for the production of the subject merchandise is now supplied by captive internal production, which
petitioners argue constitutes a significant change in supplier relationships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the merger, petitioners also argue that Rotem now has a much larger and more diverse customer base than
Negev had. Furthermore, prior to the merger, Rotem, as a fertilizer producer, had no customers in the United States
and made no sales to the United States. Therefore, the merger opened up an entirely new market for Rotem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, the respondent maintains that the petitioners have presented no arguments that had not already been
taken into account in the preliminary results. Therefore, the Department has no grounds for reversing the preliminary
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to changes in management, the respondent maintains that personnel changes as the result of the merger
are minimal. Furthermore, respondent argues that sales staff for the subject merchandise remained the same and most
of management, including top management in the company, retained their positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent claims that when addressing changes in production facilities, petitioners focus, as when addressing
other factors to determine successorship, on the production of non-subject merchandise. Prior to the merger, Negev
and Rotem formed a part of the same parent company. These two companies were both located at the same plant site and shared
some infrastructure. Moreover, products that were transferred from one company to another were transferred on special
intra-company terms. According to the respondent, these elements demonstrate that there was no change in production
facilities with regard to the subject merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent argues that petitioners' premise regarding supplier relationships is completely erroneous. Respondent
maintains that the raw material inputs obtained by Negev from Rotem are not essential or even necessary in the production
of the subject merchandise. Furthermore, when these raw materials were obtained from Rotem prior to the merger, they
were purchased under an intra-company pricing formula determined by the parent company. Therefore, there has been
no change in suppliers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to customer base, respondent claims that the customer base for the subject merchandise did not change.
Respondent argues that petitioners are focusing on sales of non-subject merchandise, as illustrated by their example
of sales to new customer groups such as the farming community. According to the respondents, the farming community
does not have a need for the subject merchandise, industrial phosphoric acid.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not agree with petitioners assertion that Rotem's operations are not essentially similar to Negev's operations
prior to the merger in terms of: (1) Management, (2) production facilities, (3) supplier relationships, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) customer base, with regard to sales and production of the subject merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to executive personnel, Negev and Rotem's board of directors consists of seven and five members, respectively.
The president and three members of the board of directors, including the chairman of the board, are the same for both
Negev and Rotem. Therefore, Rotem's five member board of directors includes three members that were also on Negev's
board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An examination of production management shows that production management was consolidated after the merger. Before
the merger, there were two site managers and two operations managers, one set for Negev operations and the other for
Rotem operations. Now there is one site manager and one operations manager for Rotem's industrial phosphoric acid
and fertilizer acid facilities. After the merger, Negev's former vice-president became a Rotem executive vice-president.
The Negev plant manager prior to the merger left the company, and Rotem's plant manager became the plant manager for
both the Rotem and Negev plant facilities. Negev's former industrial phosphoric acid site manager remained with
Rotem for about six months after the merger and was then replaced by Rotem's operations manager whose responsibilities
became the management of both industrial phosphoric acid and fertilizer acid facilities. See Verification of the
Questionnaire Response_ Antidumping Duty Order on Industrial Phosphoric Acid from Israel_ Changed Circumstances
Review; October 6, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered these changes in Rotem's management and finds that the differences are minimal. The
changes in Rotem's personnel are well within the normal range of personnel changes that one would expect over time
within the same operation. For example, in the final results of Brass Sheet and Strip, the Department found one company
to be the successor of another despite the fact that the successor company had replaced the two top managers at the acquired
plant. See Brass Sheet and Strip Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, (57 FR 20462; May 13, 1992).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to production facilities, we agree with respondents that petitioners improperly focus on the production
of non-subject merchandise to support their claim that Rotem's total production is more extensive and diverse. Rotem
did not alter production or the production facilities of the subject merchandise at the time of the merger. Moreover,
the subject merchandise continued to be manufactured in the former company's plant facilities. Furthermore, eleven
months after the merger, the Department verified that Rotem had not altered production or production facilities
for the subject merchandise subsequent to the merger. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When reviewing supplier relationships, petitioners argue that as a result of the merger, Rotem now has a captive source
of supply for certain raw material inputs necessary for production of the subject merchandise. During verification,
the Department carefully examined supplier relationships for all raw material inputs in the production of the subject
merchandise and found that the source of supplies for these inputs did not change after the merger. As respondents
point out, before the merger Negev purchased raw material inputs from Rotem at intra-company prices and, after the
merger, Rotem continued to supply these inputs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in their discussion of changes in customer base, petitioners submit that as a result of the merger, Rotem
has a larger and more diverse customer base. As in their evaluation of other factors, petitioners focus on the inclusion
of Rotem's customers for non-subject merchandise. As stated in our response to comment one, the appropriate focus
of our analysis is the subject merchandise. We agree with the respondents that the customer base for Rotem's sales
of the subject merchandise did not change after the merger.

Finally, as requested, Rotem has submitted an agreement as set forth at &sect;353.25(a)(2)(iii) to be reinstated
in the order should the Secretary conclude under &sect;353.22(f) that the company, subsequent to revocation, sold
industrial phosphoric acid at less than foreign market value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, after reviewing all comments, the Department determines that Rotem is the successor to Negev.

After reviewing the comments received, we determine that Rotem is successor to Negev and, accordingly, is not subject
to the antidumping duty order. We will instruct customs to liquidate all entries of this merchandise produced by Rotem,
exported to the United States and entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, on or after January 1, 1991.
In addition, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to terminate suspension of liquidation on entries
from Rotem and to liquidate, without regard to antidumping duties, merchandise exported by Rotem on or after January
1, 1991.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Chapter 19 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace
domestic judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports
from the other country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel
is established to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether
it conforms with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Article 1904 of the Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1989, the Government of the United States and
the Government of Canada established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews (``Rules'').
These Rules were published in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53212). The Rules were amended by Amendments to the Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational
Panel Reviews, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 27, 1989 (54 FR 53165). The Rules were further amended and a consolidated version of the amended Rules was

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 28, 1994, the Binational Panel affirmed in part and remanded in part the final affirmative injury redetermination
made by the U.S. International Trade Commission on October 25, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Panel affirmed the Commission's remand determination with regard to imports from Quebec. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Panel remanded the Commission's redetermination in the following respects: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) With respect to the Commission's causation determination, the Panel found that the information and analysis
regarding the role of SPF in the U.S. softwood lumber market, and the regional price and import penetration comparisons,
do not constitute substantial evidence of price suppression by reason of imports of softwood lumber from Canada or
are not otherwise in accordance with law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As to the Commission's price trends analysis, the Panel found that the analysis, in its present form, did not contitute
substantial evidence and is otherwise not in accordance with law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Panel further found that, should the Commission on remand rely on price trends data to support an affirmative determination,
the Commission is to provide a full analysis and explanation of the underlying data and the methodology employed in
the creation and presentation of the price trends analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Binational Panel instructed The Commission to provide its determination on remand within 45 days of the panel
decision (by March 14, 1994).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pacific Fishery Management Council is holding hearings on a proposed Amendment 8 to its Pacific Coast Groundfish
fishery management plan (FMP). The amendment would establish an individual quota (IQ) program to cover the harvest
of sablefish by vessels with groundfish limited entry permits for longline and fishpot (trap) gear. Harvest of sablefish
by: (1) Trawl gear in the limited entry fishery, or (2) longline, fishpot (trap) and exempted gear by unlicensed vessels
in the open access fishery, would not be covered by the proposed IQ program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The fixed gear sablefish IQ program designed by the Council would allocate sablefish QS (quota share_a percentage
of the total annual harvest guideline) to persons based primarily on catch history. Each year, holders of QS would
be allocated an amount of sablefish IFQ (individual fishing quota_an amount of sablefish pounds for the year based
on the amount of QS held) that could be taken anytime during the fishing season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A recent participation requirement would require at least one landing of sablefish or groundfish (to be determined)
with longline or fishpot gear between August 1, 1988, and November 13, 1991, in order for a person to qualify for an initial
allocation of QS. There may also be a minimum amount of sablefish landings which must be made between January 1, 1984,
and November 13, 1991. QS would be allocated to owners of ``A'' permits for longline or fishpot (trap) gear based at
least in part on one of the following catch histories: (1) The catch history of the permit owned at the time QS is issued,
(2) the catch history of the person as a vessel owner, or (3) some combination of the two. Confidentiality issues may
affect the choice among these options and the ability of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to implement this
program. Catch history occurring between January 1, 1984, and November 13, 1991, would be counted in determining
the amount of QS issued. Under allocation formulas being considered, between 75 and 100 percent of the quota shares
would be allocated on the basis of the best five of eight years of catch history. Up to 25 percent might be allocated primarily
on the basis of an equal allocation concept.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council is considering a number of optional provisions for the program including: (1) Caps on the amount of QS/IFQ
that may be issued to or accumulated by, a single person and the amount that may be used with a single vessel, and (2) requirements
that the QS/IFQ owner be on board the vessel when the IFQ is used. The latter of these provisions implies that leasing
would not be allowed. The provision may be combined with restrictions on the acquisition of QS/IFQ by corporations,
partnerships and other non-individual entities that do not receive an initial allocation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council will consider framework adjustments to management measures under the framework for abbreviated rulemaking
described in the final rule for Amendment 4 to the FMP for Atlantic Sea Scallops (59 FR 2757, January 19, 1994). The Council
will determine whether adjustments, or additional management measures are necessary to protect small scallops
in the Mid-Atlantic region. The Council will receive findings and recommendations from its Plan Development Team
for Atlantic Sea Scallops, which met on February 4, 1994. Additionally, the Council will determine whether adjustments
or additional management measures are necessary to address possible problems with double-linking of rings in the
dredge bags, the availability of 51/2 inch (13.97 cm) twine tops and the increase of at-sea freezing of scallops.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council's recommendation on adjustments to, or addition of, management measures must come from one or more of

The Council will consider an adjustment to the Multispecies (Groundfish) FMP under the framework for abbreviated
rulemaking (50 CFR 651.40) contained in Amendment 5 to the FMP which was approved on January 3, 1994. The proposed rule
for Amendment 5 was published on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57774); a final rule is expected to be effective on March 1, 1994,
and published before that date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the ASMFC Winter Flounder Board, the Council will discuss and accept public comment on a proposal
to limit the winter flounder component of the 500-pound (226.8 kg) groundfish possession to 100 pounds (45.3 kg).
The final rule discussed above, when implemented, will allow vessels to keep up to 500 pounds (226.8 kg), combined
weight, of the 10 large-mesh groundfish species while fishing with mesh smaller than the regulated minimum size.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASMFC is concerned that a 500-pound (226.8 kg) limit is an incentive to target winter flounder with small mesh that
may result in the discarding of unacceptable numbers of winter flounder that are under the currently legal minimum
fish size of 12 inches (30.48 cm). The ASMFC is urging the Council to take this action to protect a moderately strong
1992 year class of winter flounder, which will be susceptible to the small-mesh fishing gear before reaching the minimum
legal size.

Adjustment of Closure of Area I To Gillnetting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council will also consider an adjustment to the closure of Area I to gillnetting in the Multispecies FMP under the
framework for abbreviated rulemaking contained in the proposed rule published on October 27, 1993. At the request
of a number of sink gillnet fishermen, the Council will discuss and take public comment on a proposal to shift the time
of the closure of Area I to gillnetting. The final rule implementing Amendment 5 to the Multispecies FMP will open Area
I to all fishing gear types except sink gillnets. Unless modified by a framework measure, gillnetting will be prohibited
from February through May.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council proposed to open Area I to all gears except sink gillnets because haddock spawning has not been observed
in the area in recent years. At the recommendation of the NMFS Regional Director, the Council proposed retaining the
closure of Area I to gillnetting because of the potential interaction with endangered whales, which are known to feed
in the area during the spring. The February through May closure period was originally set to protect aggregations
of spawning haddock and does not coincide with the observed presence of the whales, which the gillnetting closure
is intended to protect. The Council proposes to begin the closure of Area I in the middle of March and extend it to the
middle of July.

Time/Area Closures To Reduce the Take of Harbor Porpoise in the Gulf of Maine Sink Gillnet Fishery
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the request of the NMFS and the Council's Marine Mammal and Endangered Species Committee, the Council has developed
proposals to reduce the take of harbor porpoise in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery by the end of year 4 of implementation
of the Northeast Multispecies FMP to a level not to exceed 2 percent of the porpoise population, based on the best available
estimates of abundance and catch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the framework for abbreviated rulemaking (50 CFR 651.40, to be published in March 1994) the Council has requested
its Harbor Porpoise Review Team (HPRT) to evaluate ``reduction of take measures'' for the harbor porpoise bycatch
in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery. Those measures, which include closures in the Gulf of Maine by area and time,
any recommendations made by the HPRT, and public comments, will be discussed at the February 16 and 17 Council meeting
in order to initiate the framework process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the February 16&hyph;17 Council meeting, the Council will determine whether the requested adjustment to the regulations
for sea scallops and groundfish are necessary and will initiate a public comment period. The Council staff will analyze
the proposals and announce the availability of analysis documents prior to the second Council meeting (April 6&hyph;7,
1994). The public will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal(s) prior to and at the April Council meeting.
After developing management actions and receiving public testimony, the Council will make a recommendation to the
Regional Director. The Regional Director may publish the action as a final rule or as a proposed rule, as described
in &sect;651.40.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested parties are hereby notified that the District Engineer, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District,
has prepared a Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (FPEIS) for the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM)
regarding Joint Training Exercise Roving Sands (RS) proposed to be conducted at Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile
Range. This EIS addresses the next five RS exercises as well as potential uses of RS sites by 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment
and 11th Air Defense Artillery (ADA) Brigade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed action: Roving Sands is an annual training exercise coordinated by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff,
sponsored by FORSCOM, and executed by the 11th ADA Brigade. The exercise will take place at Fort Bliss, Texas and New
Mexico; White Sands Missile Range, Holloman Air Force Base, and Roswell, New Mexico. Most of the ground activity will
occur on established Fort Bliss training areas. As many as 10,000 Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine personnel will
participate in the exercise, with about 200 aircraft and 3,000 wheeled vehicles. Roving Sands is scheduled to be conducted
during the April-June time period each year. The exercise will last approximately three weeks. Actual force employment
and field training will be approximately 11 days. This action does not involve a discharge of dredged or fill material
into waters of the United States or wetlands and no evaluation into Section 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act is required.
Cultural and biological surveys have been conducted to satisfy pertinent statutory and regulatory requirements
pertaining to historical and archaeological resources as well as threatened and endangered species and critical
habitats. No threatened or endangered species or cultural resources would be affected by this action. Advance planning
has been used to avoid any sites which are environmentally sensitive.

Natural proposes to abandon about 490 miles of 24-inch-diameter Amarillo No. 1 mainline and to remove it over a 4- to
5-year period. Natural proposes to leave the pipe in place in sensitive areas (such as waterbody crossings, wetland
crossings, and areas of cultural and sensitive biological resources) where it believes removal activities could
result in significant environmental impacts.

A loop is a segment of pipeline that is installed adjacent to an existing pipeline and connected to it at both ends. The
loop allows more gas to be moved through the pipeline system at the location in which the loop is installed.

Natural proposes to use a 75-foot-wide to 100-foot-wide construction right-of-way, at least partly within existing
rights-of-way. Areas of steep slope, staging areas, and other areas where additional right-of-way would be needed
to permit safe construction would be identified on a site-specific basis. No new permanent right-of-way would be
required. Abandonment of all 490 miles of pipe by removal and construction of the replacement pipeline would disturb
about 5,900 acres. Most of the acreage disturbed would consist of existing pipeline right-of-way.

One storage yard, about 4 acres in size, would be required for each of the four segments of new pipeline. Storage yards,
about 6 acres in size, would be required about every 50 miles for the removal of the abandoned Amarillo No. 1 mainline.
Private roads/lanes would be used to access the pipeline during construction and removal. These roads may require
repair and upgrading to support increased traffic.

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By the
Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments
received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA.

We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process,
the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings.
A comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will then consider all comments on the EA before
we recommend that the Commission approve or not approve the project.

Currently Identified Environmental Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed
facilities and the environmental information provided by Natural. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list; the
list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our own analysis. The currently
identified issues are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The removal of abandoned pipeline and construction of new pipeline could affect 30.42 acres of wetlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The project could cross habitat of the least tern, bald eagle, and whooping crane (federally listed endangered
species) and of the piping plover (a federally listed threatened species). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The project could cross habitat of the Arkansas darter, Arkansas river shiner, snowy plover, and eastern spotted
skunk (Federal candidate species). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Pipeline would be abandoned within the Fort Larned National Historic Site (a National Historic Landmark).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The abandoned pipe may be coated with materials that contain asbestos.

Becoming an Intervenor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or an
``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission documents
and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other parties.
If you want to become an intervenor, you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules
of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by &sect;385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. In certain cases environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. Section 385.214(d)
applies to grants of late intervention. You do not need intervenor status to have your scoping comments considered.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a new license for the existing Niangua Hydroelectric Project, located on the Niangua River in
Camden County, Missouri near the city of Camdenton, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the
project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts
of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement
measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on January 14, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (``El Paso''), a Delaware corporation, whose mailing
address is Post Office Box 1492, El Paso, Texas, 79978, filed an application at Docket No. CP94&hyph;183&hyph;000,
pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act (``NGA'') and &sect;157.5 et seq., of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission's (``Commission'') Regulations Under the NGA, for an order granting abandonment authority effective
January 1, 1996, and terminating certain certificates of public convenience and necessity in effect on such date
to the extent such certificates apply to El Paso's gas gathering, dehydration, purification, and products extraction
facilities, with appurtenances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states that it intends, effective January 1, 1996, to complete a major corporate restructuring in which all
of El Paso's gas gathering, treating, and processing functions will be transferred to and assumed by El Paso Field
Services Company (``Field Services''), El Paso's wholly-owned subsidiary. After facility transfer, El Paso will
no longer perform any gathering, dehydration, purification, or products extraction activities, nor will it own
any facilities for that purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states that, first, it desires abandonment authorization only with respect to those facilities that the Commission
finds constitute nonjurisdictional gathering or processing facilities under section 1(b) of the NGA. Second, Field
Services requires and, in its Petition for Declaratory Order filed concurrently with El Paso's abandonment application,
requests a determination that it may establish the rates, terms, and conditions for the nonjurisdictional services
it provides through negotiations with the parties requesting such services. With respect to gathering facilities
that were certificated, El Paso seeks and order: (1) Determining that the facilities are not jurisdictional facilities;
and (2) upon said determination, granting abandonment authority with respect to any certificate that would otherwise
be in the effect on January 1, 1996, to the extent such certificate applies to a nonjurisdictional facility. All of
the certificated facilities for which abandonment is sought constitute nonjurisdictional gathering or processing
facilities under the primary function test developed in Farmland Industries Inc., 23 FERC &para;61,063 (1983),
it is asserted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states that the certificated facilities which constitute part of El Paso's gathering systems, and for which
abandonment is requested represent only $77.418,883 of gross plant out of a total of $519,464,972 of gross plant for
all facilities to be transferred to Field Services and, on a net plant basis, only $43,151,458 out of the $221,296,764
of total gathering system net plant (as of November 30, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, El Paso states that although it will cease to provide gathering and related services currently being
rendered under its part 284 Transportation Service Agreements (``TSA''), Field Services, as described in its Petition
for Declaratory Order, intends to offer to provide all of such services on an open-access basis. Thus, there will be
no interruption of the services available to any party currently receiving service under such a TSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to its part 284 transactions, El Paso sets forth that in a few instances El Paso provides transportation
services pursuant to arrangements that are filed as ``special rate schedules'' in Volume No. 2 of El Paso's FERC Gas
Tariff. Special Rate Schedule Z&hyph;8 is a Gathering Agreement between El Paso and TOC-Rocky Mountain Inc., as successor
to Tenneco Oil Company, dated May 9, 1984, providing for gathering services in the San Juan Basin. Special Rate Schedule
Z&hyph;9 is a similar Gathering Agreement between El Paso and Conoco Inc. also dated May 9, 1984, and providing for
gathering services in the San Juan Basin. Inasmuch as all of the facilities required for performance under the Agreements
will be transferred to Field Services, El Paso intends to assign the two Agreements to Field Services effective January
1, 1996. El Paso requested Commission authorization to cancel special Rate Schedules Z&hyph;8 and Z&hyph;9 and for
such abandonment authorization as may be necessary for that purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso also requests such authorization as may be necessary to abandon services under special Rate Schedule T&hyph;14
(Volume No. 2 Combination Agreement with Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America) insofar as it provides for gathering
or related services utilizing the facilities to be transferred to Field Services. In addition, with respect to certain
exchange arrangements contained in El Paso's Volume No. 2 Tariff which provides for El Paso to redeliver gas received
on its mainline system to delivery points on its gathering system, El Paso intends to enter into appropriate arrangements
with Field Services to accomplish the redeliveries required and thus does not request any Commission authorization
with respect to such arrangements. El Paso sets forth that Field Services will provide service as an open-access transporter
and specifically intends to provide any necessary gathering services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states that the conveyance of El Paso's gathering facilities to Field Services on January 1, 1996, will not
have any impact on El Paso's existing gas sales obligations and arrangements, nor will it affect El Paso's performance
under any existing gas purchase contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso avers that all mainline services currently provided by El Paso will continue to be provided in accordance with
El Paso's FERC Gas Tariff. No material rate issues are raised by the transfer of these facilities. Finally, there will
be no adverse environmental effects from the abandonment proposed herein.

to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to install
a new point of delivery for interruptible transportation service to Commonwealth Gas Services, Inc. (Commonwealth),
as existing customer, under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP86&hyph;240&hyph;000, all as more fully
set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Columbia Gas states that Commonwealth has requested the new point of delivery. Columbia Gas indicates that the estimated
maximum daily quantity and the estimated annual quantity of natural gas that it will provide through the new delivery
point is 55,000 Dth and 20,075,000 Dth, respectively. Columbia Gas further states that the quantities to be provided
through the new delivery point will be provided on an interruptible basis and therefore, there is no impact on Columbia
Gas' existing design day and annual obligations to its customers as a result of the construction and operation of the
new point of delivery for interruptible transportation service.

Take notice that on January 31, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252,
filed a prior notice request with the Commission in Docket No. CP94&hyph;205&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 157.205
of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to operate three existing delivery
point facilities (which were constructed under Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978) under Tennessee's
blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;413&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the NGA, all as more fully
set forth in the request which is open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee proposes to operate the Franklin Gas Lift delivery point in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana; the Hurricane Sales
delivery point in Putnam County, West Virginia; and the Plymouth Sales delivery point in San Patricio County, Texas,
under its blanket certificate. Tennessee asserts that since it now renders significant transportation service
under its Subpart G blanket certificate, operation of the delivery points would provide more flexibility in using
its facilities to the benefit of all customers on Tennessee's system. Tennessee states that the delivery of natural
gas volumes through these existing delivery points would not impact Tennessee's peak day and annual deliveries;
that its tariff permits the proposed activity; and that it has sufficient capacity to accommodate the proposed changes
without detriment or disadvantage to Tennessee's other customers.

Take notice that on February 1, 1994, Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas), 555 West Fifth Street, Los Angeles,
California 90013&hyph;1011, filed an application in Docket No. CP94&hyph;207&hyph;000. The application requests
authorization under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act, and the issuance of a Presidential Permit under Executive Order
10485, as amended by Executive Order 12038. SoCalGas seeks the Section 3 authorization and the Presidential Permit
so that it may construct, connect, operate, and maintain certain natural gas pipeline and metering export facilities.
The export facilities will be located in Imperial County, California, near the International Boundary between the
United States and the Republic of Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SoCalGas proposes to construct and operate the following export facilities:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) One metering station consisting of one 8-inch turbine meter run and one 12-inch turbine meter run; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Either approximately:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 900 feet of 16-inch diameter pipeline, with appurtenances, connecting the meter station to the border, (Bowker
Road Alternative); or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 4,800 feet of 16-inch diameter pipeline, with appurtenances, connecting the meter station to the border, (Calzada

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SoCalGas says that it will notify the Commission of the particular site of the border crossing no later than May 1, 1994.
The export facilities will have a capacity of 40,000 Mcf per day. SoCalGas estimates the cost of the Bowker Road Alternative
to be about &sect;350,000 and the cost of the Calzada Justo Sierra Alternative to be about &sect;590,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SoCalGas says that the export facilities will be used to provide natural gas transportation service from receipt
points on the SoCalGas systems to the United States_Mexico border. The rates for this service will be rates on file
with, and approved by, the California Public Utilities Commission. Any third-party shippers or exporters will be
required to obtain the proper export authorization from the United States Department of Energy, Office of Fossil
Energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A connecting pipeline to receive the exported natural gas will be built on the Mexican side of the border and operated
by Petroleos Mexicanos. SoCalGas also describes certain other related facilities which are scheduled to be built
by it in Imperial County. SoCalGas says that these facilities, (about 31 miles of pipeline, with appurtenances),
are under the jurisdiction of the California Public Utilities Commission. SoCalGas says that they will be used to
serve native California natural gas load, in conjunction with the export transportation service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SoCalGas says that this overall project will permit the export of natural gas to the City of Mexicali, Mexico, to serve
both the existing local distribution system in Mexicali and industrial end-users in the Mexicali area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SoCalGas says that these customers presently use propane-air, liquefied petroleum gas, diesel fuel, high sulfur
fuel oil and other petroleum products. SoCalGas says that the replacement of these products by natural gas will result
in a reduction in air pollution in the U.S.-Mexico border area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SoCalGas requests that approval of this application be granted no later than June 1, 1994.

68124&hyph;1000, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;209&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212
of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to construct
and operate new facilities to provide additional natural gas deliveries to Peoples Natural Gas Company, a Division
of UtiliCorp United Inc. (Peoples), under Northern's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;401&hyph;000
pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern proposes to install a small volume measuring station and appurtenant facilities as a new delivery point
to accommodate a new service by Peoples to Dodge City Cooperative Exchange, a commercial end-user. Northern indicates
that the delivery point would be located at an existing farm tap in Section 34, T27S, R25W, Ford County, Kansas, and
states that the gas would be provided to Peoples under Northern's currently effective transportation service agreement
and rate schedules. Northern advises that the peak day and annual volumes are expected to be 24 Mcf per day and 5,000
Mcf, respectively. Northern estimates that the facilities would cost $1,890 which would be paid by Peoples as a contribution
in aid of construction.

Mojave proposes to construct a connection between its existing 30-inch line and the All American Gas Pipeline Company's
(All American) gas supply pipeline to its Cadiz pump-station in San Bernardino California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mojave states that it would transport the gas on behalf of All American pursuant to its existing blanket transportation
certificate under existing rate schedules. Mojave states further because All American's firm entitlement is less
than the previously uncommitted capacity on Mojave, service to Mojave's other customers should not be affected by
transportation on behalf of All American.

PURPOSE: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in December 1990 with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic
investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed
to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility
to CDC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, an MOU was signed in October 1990 and renewed in November 1992 between ATSDR and DOE. The MOU delineates
the responsibilities and procedures for ATSDR's public health activities at DOE sites required under sections 104,
107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or ``Superfund'').
These activities include health consultations and public health assessments at DOE sites listed on, or proposed
for, the Superfund National Priorities List and at sites that are the subject of petitions from the public; and other
health-related activities such as epidemiologic studies, health surveillance, exposure and disease registries,
health education, substance-specific applied research, emergency response, and preparation of toxicological
profiles.

Community involvement is a critical part of the HHS energy-related research and activities. The availability of
a formal site-specific advisory committee composed of citizens of certain affected areas to provide consensus advice
to CDC and ATSDR regarding these activities is necessary. CDC and ATSDR are currently taking steps to obtain authorization
for a ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at Department of Energy Sites''
to be chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this workshop is to provide interested parties an opportunity to give individual advice and recommendations
regarding: (1) Community involvement between representatives of affected populations, Native American Nations,
and CDC and ATSDR; (2) the principles and process of public involvement given the diversities of interests and needs
of affected and potentially affected populations and Native American Nations; (3) the concerns and needs which may
be common to all; and, (4) provide a public forum for citizens of affected populations. A copy of the proposed ``Citizens'
Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at DOE Sites'' draft charter is available upon
request from the contact person listed below.

PURPOSE:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in December 1990 with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic
investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed
to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility
to CDC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, an MOU was signed in October 1990 and renewed in November 1992 between ATSDR and DOE. The MOU delineates
the responsibilities and procedures for ATSDR's public health activities at DOE sites required under sections 104,
107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or ``Superfund'').
These activities include health consultations and public health assessments at DOE sites listed on, or proposed
for, the Superfund National Priorities List and at sites that are the subject of petitions from the public; and other
health-related activities such as epidemiologic studies, health surveillance, exposure and disease registries,
health education, substance-specific applied research, emergency response, and preparation of toxicological
profiles.

Community involvement is a critical part of the HHS energy-related research and activities. With an environmental
dose reconstruction for DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho, as well as a worker
study at the same site, the availability of a formal site-specific advisory committee composed of Idaho citizens
to provide consensus advice regarding these projects is necessary. CDC and ATSDR are currently taking steps to obtain
authorization for a ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at Department
of Energy Sites'' to be chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The draft charter for this proposed committee
states, ``Because of the varying concerns within communities at each DOE site, operational guidelines at each site
must be developed separately to clarify the scope of activities and the responsibilities of the Committee members
and agencies.'' Therefore, CDC and ATSDR are holding a series of public meetings to begin developing operational
guidelines at specific DOE sites. The purpose of these public meetings is to update the public on the status of CDC's
and ATSDR's community involvement plans and to seek individual advice and recommendations from interested parties
concerning operational guidelines. A copy of the proposed ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service
Activities and Research at DOE Sites'' draft charter is available upon request from the contact person listed below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice is intended to inform the public of the planning effort and to invite public participation in the identification
of the planning issues and planning criteria. Public comment will be solicited throughout the planning process.
The amended Box Elder RMP will be prepared under 43 CFR, part 1610 to meet the requirements of section 202 of the Federal
Land Policy and Management Act. Decisions generated during this planning process will supersede the decisions in
the 1986 Box Elder RMP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RMP amendment and EA will address the general planning issue of management prescriptions for numerous scattered
tracts of land (approximately 42,350 acres) which have been acquired and to address management of future land acquisitions.
Specific items to be addressed include the possible designation of Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC)
in the Salt Wells Wildlife Area (WHA), Blue Springs WHA, and the inclusion of additional public lands within the Central
Pacific Railroad Grade ACEC and the Donner Creek/Bettridge Creek ACEC. Other topics will include livestock grazing,
oil and gas, off-road-vehicle use, wilderness, and land tenure adjustments and any other planning issues that may
need to be addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tentative planning criteria to be used are those identified in the existing Box Elder RMP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public participation is being sought at this initial stage in the planning process to ensure the RMP amendment addresses
all issues, problems, and concerns from those interested in the management of lands within the Bear River Resource
Area. Necessary amendments to the approved plan will keep the document current and viable.

Assistance</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor herein presents summaries
of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance for workers (TA&hyph;W) issued
during the period of February, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment
assistance to be issued, each of the group eligibility requirements of Section 222 of the Act must be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That a significant number or proportion of the workers in the worker's firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
have become totally or partially separated,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That sales or production, or both, of the firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm or appropriate
subdivision have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the absolute decline in sales
or production.

Petitions have been filed with the Secretary of Labor under Section 221(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (``the Act'') and
are identified in the Appendix to this notice. Upon receipt of these petitions, the Director of the Office of Trade
Adjustment Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, has instituted investigations pursuant to Section
221(a) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of each of the investigations is to determine whether the workers are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Title II, Chapter 2, of the Act. The investigations will further relate, as appropriate, to the determination
of the date on which total or partial separations began or threatened to begin and the subdivision of the firm involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S&hyph;3014, Washington, DC 20210.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pittsburg and Midway Coal Mining Company, P.O. Box 6518, Englewood, Colorado 80155 has filed a petition to modify
the application of 30 CFR 77.1304 (blasting agents; special provisions) to its McKinley Mine (I.D. No. 29&hyph;00096)
located in McKinley County, New Mexico. The petitioner requests a modification of the standard to permit the use of
fuel oil, blended with recycled oil as a blasting agent. The petitioner proposes to blend recycled oil with No. 2 fuel
oil to use in the ANFO blasting media; to use a 10,000 gallon recycled oil/diesel fuel blend tank, transfer pump, valves,
flow meter, filter housing, and necessary piping; to isolate the 10,000 gallon tank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the 250,000 gallon tank to eliminate the possibility of fuel contamination; and to visually inspect the filter
element bypass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each time the system is used. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the
same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Interstate Thermal Energy Conversion Corporation, 50 West Main Street, P.O. Drawer 1187, Uniontown, Pennsylvania
15401 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
75.364(b)(2) (weekly examination) to its Clyde Mine (I.D. No. 36&hyph;00967) located in Washington County, Pennsylvania.
The petitioner proposes to maintain proper ventilation in the return air course by traveling the right 1 West Main
return airway to the piping overcast in order to view through, then enter the adjacent entry by a man door in the stopping
wall to examine the entry the piping goes through, and exit the entry by a man door into the next adjacent entry and look
back through the piping for that examination with the other return pipe overcasts. The petitioner asserts that the
proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

2, Box 97A, Hegins, Pennsylvania 17938 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.335 (construction
of seals) to its M&amp;R Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;05495) located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner
requests a modification of the standard to permit alternative methods of construction using wooden materials of
moderate size and weight due to the difficulty in accessing previously driven headings and breasts containing inaccessible
abandoned workings; to accept a design criteria in the 10 psi range; and to permit the water trap to be installed in the
gangway seal and sampling tube in the monkey seal for seals installed in pairs. The petitioner asserts that the proposed
alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6 Deep Mine (I.D. No. 15&hyph;12475) located in Whitley County, Kentucky. Due to adverse roof conditions in the parallel
intake air course, the area cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner states that the area involved was driven off
a parallel pure intake air course prior to the new ventilation regulation of November 1992, that even with extensive
cribbing the intake area has developed adverse roof conditions, and that to perform preshift examinations of the
room necks would be unsafe. The petitioner proposes to install methane detecting sensors at the areas of approach
in the parallel intakes and an additional methane detecting sensor where the air which has coursed by these room necks,
driven in excess of 20 feet deep, joins with the main mine intake. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate
method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

of 30 CFR 18.41 to its Big Ridge Mine (I.D. No. 11&hyph;02879) located in Saline County, Illinois. The petitioner proposes
to use fabricated metal locking devices with a locking screw threaded through a steel bracket to lock battery plugs
to machine-mounted battery receptacles on permissible, mobile, battery-powered machines instead of using padlocks;
and to submit a training plan for all operators of this equipment concerning this proposed alternate method to the
Agency and District Manager.

AKZO Salt, Inc., P.O. Box 6920, Cleveland, Ohio 44101 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 57.19109
to its Cleveland Mine (I.D. No. 33&hyph;01994) located in Cuyahoga 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
County, Ohio. The petitioner proposes to install pairs of cables approximately 4 feet above and parallel to the divider
timbers to enhance the function of the timbers; to cover the sides of each divider timber with ultra-high molecular
weight polyethylene material to reduce abrasion to the timbers; in addition to water slicing, to inspect the shaft
prior to conducting any work on the platform to ensure that there are no loose material on the sides of the shaft; to place
barricades around the shaft at both the collar and mine level prior to doing work on the platform; and to provide training
to all personnel working on the platform. The petitioner states that to place boards across the shaft at the mine level
when personnel are required to work on the dividers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would result in a diminution of safety and would expose miners to hazardous conditions. In addition, the petitioner
asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory
standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Licensing Support System Advisory Review Panel was established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as a Federal
Advisory Committee in 1989. Its purpose is to provide advice to (1) the Department of Energy on the fundamental issues
of design and development of an electronic information management system to be used to store and retrieve documents
relating to the licensing of a geologic repository for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste, and (2) the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission on the operation and maintenance of the system. This electronic information management system
is known as the Licensing Support System (LSS).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Membership on the Panel is drawn from those interests that will be affected by the use of the LSS, including the Department
of Energy, the NRC, the State of Nevada, Tribal interests, affected units of local governments in Nevada, and the nuclear
industry. Federal agencies with expertise and experience in electronic information management systems also participate
on the Panel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has determined that renewal of the charter for the LSSARP until December 19, 1994
is in the public interest in connection with duties imposed on the Commission by law. This action is being taken in accordance
with the Federal Advisory Committee Act after consultation with the Committee Management Secretariat, General
Services Administration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Safety Research Review Committee was established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as a Federal Advisory
Committee in February 1988 to provide advice to the Director, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, on matters relating
to NRC's nuclear safety research programs. The committee is composed of experts capable of providing a wide variety
of technical and managerial viewpoints drawn from industrial national laboratory, university and not-for-profit
research organizations.

In accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92&hyph;463), and after consultation with the General
Services Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has determined that there is a continuing need for the
Nuclear Safety Research Review Committee and that renewal of the committee for a two year period beginning February
9, 1994 is in the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirement
of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.A.6(b) to Detroit Edison Company (the licensee), for operation of the
Fermi 2 Plant, located in Monroe County, Michigan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would grant an exemption from the accelerated Type A integrated leak rate test frequency requirement
of Appendix J, Paragraph III.A.6(b) of 10 CFR part 50. On May 24, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from paragraph
III.A.6(b) which requires that if two consecutive Type A tests fail to meet the acceptance criteria, a Type A test shall
be performed at each plant shutdown for refueling or approximately every 18 months, whichever occurs first, until
two consecutive Type A tests meet the acceptance criteria. The licensee identified the cause of the Type A failures
as Type C local leakage which has subsequently been corrected. The licensee reference NRC Information Notice (IN)
85&hyph;71, ``Containment Integrated Leak Rate Tests,'' for guidance concerning the requested exemption. IN 85&hyph;71
states that ``if Type B and C leakage rates constitute an identified contributor to this failure of the as-found condition
for the CILRT [Type A containment integrated leak rate test], the general purpose of maintaining a high degree of containment
integrity might be better served through an improved maintenance and testing program for containment penetration
boundaries and isolation valves. In this situation, the licensee may submit a Corrective Action Plan with an alternative
leakage test program proposal as an exemption request for NRC staff review.'' If this submittal is approved, the licensee
is allowed to implement the corrective actions in lieu of the required increased in Type A test frequency.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption is needed because compliance to paragraph III.A.6(b) of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, would result
in increased costs, extended outage time and additional personnel radiation exposure in order to comply with the
increased Type A test frequency. The establishment of a Corrective Action Plan meets the underlying purpose of the
regulations for maintaining overall containment integrity. This action is similar to that approved for several
other facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption would allow the substitution of a Corrective Action Plan in lieu of an increased test frequency
for containment Type A leakage tests. The purpose of Type A testing is to ensure that the leakage through the primary
reactor containment would not exceed the maximum allowable leakage during a design basis accident. It also provides
assurance that the Local Leak Rate Test (LLRT) Program adequately identifies and corrects containment penetrations
requiring repair. The licensee has implemented a Corrective Action Plan to correct LLRT deficiencies which have
been attributed as the cause for previous Type A failures which have led to the increased testing frequency. The approved
Corrective Action Plan will provide equivalent assurance of containment integrity, and will not alter the method
of operation of the facility. The only change will be, on a one-time basis, the frequency for conducting the Type A CILRT.
Therefore, post-accident radiological releases will not exceed previously determined values as a result of the
proposed action. Further, the exemption is not expected to have an impact on plant radiological effluent releases.
The proposed action does have the potential to reduce occupational exposure by reducing the amount of time personnel
are required to spend in a radiologically restricted area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action and related change to the Technical Specifications
involve a change in the surveillance requirements and will not affect non-radiological plant effluents nor does
it have any other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.

Alternative to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption and amendment. This would not reduce environmental
impacts of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility and greater occupational exposure
to plant personnel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirement
of 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1) to Indiana Michigan Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear
Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Berrien County, Michigan.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would grant an exemption from the requirement of 10 CFR 55.59)a)(1), which requires that a requalification
program for operator licensees and senior operator licensees be conducted for a continuous period not to exceed 24
months in duration. The licensee has requested an exemption which would allow it to administer the operating portion
of the annual operator requalification examination in the May&hyph;June, 1994 timeframe rather than at the end of
the 24-month requalification cycle in February 1994. The licensee's request for exemption and the bases are contained
in its letter dated October 4, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption is from 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1), which requires that a requalification program for operator licensees
and senior operator licensees be conducted for a continuous period not to exceed 24 months in duration. In addition,
an annual requalification examination must be passed. The licensee requested an exemption in order to administer
the operating portion of the requalification examination from the current 24-month cycle approximately 4 months
into the next cycle due to installation of control room modifications. This would be a one-time exemption and the next
examination would be administered on schedule in January 1995, which is consistent with the annual examination requirement
cited in 10 CFR 55.59(a)(2).

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would allow rescheduling of a portion of the operator license requalification examinations
from the current 24-month requalification cycle into the next cycle. This exemption would not increase the risk of
facility accidents. Thus, post-accident radiological releases will not be greater than previously determined,
nor does the proposed exemption otherwise affect the quantity of radiological plant effluents, nor result in any
significant increase in occupational exposure. Likewise, the exemption does not affect non-radiological plant
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
radiological or non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce environmental impacts
of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Commission's Final Environmental
Statement related to operation of D.C. Cook, Units 1 and 2, dated August 1973.

Commission
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the State of Kansas enter into this Agreement under the authority
of Section 274i of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kansas recognizes the Federal Government, primarily the NRC, as having the exclusive authority and responsibility
to regulate the radiological and national security aspects of the construction and operation of nuclear production
or utilization facilities, except for certain authority over air emissions granted to States by the Clean Air Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, authorize the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NCR) to license and regulate, among other activities, the manufacture, construction, and
operation of utilization facilities (nuclear power plants) in order to assure common defense and security and to
protect the public health and safety. Under these statutes, the NRC is the responsible agency regulating nuclear
power plant safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. NRC believes that its mission to protect the public health and safety can be served by a policy of cooperation with
State governments and has formally adopted a policy statement on ``Cooperation with States at Commercial Nuclear
Power Plants and Other Nuclear Production or Utilization Facilities'' (54 FR 7530, February 22, 1989). The policy
statement provides that NRC will consider State proposals to enter into instruments of cooperation for certain programs
when these programs have provisions to ensure close cooperation with NRC. This agreement is intended to be consistent
with, and implement the provisions of the NRC's policy statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. NRC fulfills its statutory mandate to regulate nuclear power plant safety by, among other things, responding to
emergencies at licensee's facilities and monitoring the status and adequacy of the licensee's responses to emergency
situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Kansas fulfills its statutory mandate to provide for preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery in the
event of an accident at a nuclear power plant through the Kansas Department of Health and Environment(KDHE) and the
Kansas Division of Emergency Preparedness(KDEP) of the Adjutant General's Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. This Agreement defines the way in which NRC and KDHE and KDEP will cooperate in planning and maintaining the capability
to transfer reactor plant data via the Emergency Response Data System during emergencies at nuclear power plants
in the State of Kansas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. It is understood by the NRC and the State of Kansas that ERDS data will only be transmitted by a licensee during emergencies
classified at the Alert level or above, during scheduled tests, or during exercises when available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to restrict or expand the statutory authority of NRC, the State of Kansas,
or to affect or otherwise alter the terms of any agreement in effect under the authority of Section 274b of the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended; nor is anything in this Agreement intended to restrict or expand the authority of the
State of Kansas on matters not within the scope of this Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Nothing in this Agreement confers upon the State of Kansas authority to (1) interpret or modify NRC regulations
and NRC requirements imposed on the licensee; (2) take enforcement actions; (3) issue confirmatory letters; (4)
amend, modify, or revoke a license issued by NRC; or (5) direct or recommend nuclear power plant employees to take or
not take any action. Authority for all such actions is reserved exclusively to the NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. NRC's General Responsibilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this agreement, NRC is responsible for maintaining the Emergency Response Data System (ERDS). ERDS is a system
designed to receive, store, and retransmit data from in-plant data systems at nuclear power plants during emergencies.
The NRC will provide user access to ERDS data to one user terminal for the State of Kansas during emergencies at nuclear
power plants which have implemented an ERDS interface and for which any portion of the plant's 10 mile Emergency Planning
Zone (EPZ) lies within the State of Kansas. The NRC agrees to provide unique software already available to NRC (not
commercially available) that was developed under NRC contract for configuring an ERDS workstation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Kansas General Responsibilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. KDHE will, in cooperation with the NRC, establish a capability to receive ERDS data. To this end, KDHE will provide
the necessary computer hardware and commercially licensed software required for ERDS data transfer to users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. KDHE agrees not to use ERDS to access data from nuclear power plants for which a portion of the 10 mile Emergency Planning
Zone does not fall within its State boundary.

The Tennessee Valley Authority (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;33 and DPT&hyph;68,
which authorize operation of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) Units 1 and 3. The licenses provide, among other
things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These facilities are two boiling water reactors located at the licensee's site in Limestone County, Alabama. One
other boiling water reactor at this site is not affected by this exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against
radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), in part, states: ``The licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite
physical protection system and security organization which will have as its objective to provide high assurance
that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense and security and do not
constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Containment access controls specified by 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) require that any time frequent access to the containment
is required, positive controls are maintained by a guard or watchman to assure only authorized personnel or materials
are permitted into the containment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BFN Units 1 and 3 have been shut down since March 1985 for modifications required to put the units in compliance with
applicable regulatory requirements. A substantial number of the required modifications require frequent containment
access. Therefore, the licensee has maintained a guard at a controlled access location to fulfill the requirements
of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BFN Units 1 and 3 have been defueled since September 1985 and February 1987, respectively. In a defueled condition,
the potential radiological hazard associated with postulated accidents for these reactors is very low. Therefore,
on September 2, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) to eliminate the positive containment
access controls until the reactors are refueled. In response to a request for additional information dated December
2, 1993, on December 17, 1993, the licensee provided information verifying the small radiological hazard for the
defueled reactors.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person
or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger life
or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55,
the Commission may authorize a licensee to provide alternate measures for protection against radiological sabotage
provided the licensee demonstrates that the alternate measures have ``the same high assurance objective'' and meet
``the general performance requirements'' of the regulation, and ``the overall level of system performance provides
protection against radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee asserts that these criteria are satisfied and an exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) requirements can
be granted, give the unique status of BFN Units 1 and 3 and the other controls which are or will be exercised to ensure
the reactors are returned to service in a safe manner. Presently, the reactors are defueled, which reduces the radiological
hazard potential within the containment such that sabotage could not create a substantial public radiation dose.
The licensee notes that it will perform extensive return-to-service testing on all safety-related systems. This
testing ensures that plant components can properly perform their intended design functions. After modifications
are completed, the licensee will also perform security inspections to detect sabotage or introduction of foreign
material which may have occurred during the recovery effort.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee's application also discusses measures such as access authorization controls, criminal background
checks, and fitness for duty verification. However, the staff has found that these measures are consistent with minimum
compliance with the regulations, and do not constitute compensatory actions which justify granting the exemption.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As documented in the staff's safety evaluation, given the fact that the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 3 are
defueled for the duration of this exemption, and the licensee's plans for security inspections and return-to-service
testing of equipment provide the same high assurance, meet the general performance requirements, and provide an
overall level of radiological sabotage protection equivalent to continued conformance to the regulation. Accordingly,
the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, an exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life
or property or common defense or security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby
grants the licensee an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) for positive containment access controls
on BFN Units 1 and 3 during periods of frequent access until immediately before fuel is loaded. Provisions of 10 CFR
73.55(d)(8) pertaining to other containment access controls shall remain in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 3881, January 27, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption is effective upon issuance. This exemption expires for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Unit 1 when the
licensee begins to load nuclear fuel in that reactor, and expires for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Unit 3 when the
licensee begins to load nuclear fuel in that reactor.

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Securities and Exchange Commission has submitted for OMB approval proposed amendments to rule 203&hyph;1
and Form ADV, rule 204&hyph;1, and rule 204&hyph;3 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (``Advisers Act'').
The amendments pertain to disclosure by investment advisers that sponsor ``wrap fee programs,'' services under
which investment advice and brokerage services are paid for in a single ``wrap'' fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments to rule 203&hyph;1 and Form ADV would require sponsors of wrap fee programs to prepare and
file with the Commission new Schedule H to Form ADV discussing important information about the wrap fee program. It
is estimated that approximately 300 investment advisers would be required to amend their Form ADVs to include Schedule
H in the first year after the schedule's adoption, and that each adviser completing Schedule H would incur six burden
hours in its preparation. The increase in burden resulting from this amendment will be reflected in the burden associated
with rule 204&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, it is estimated that each year approximately thirty investment advisers will be required to complete
Schedule H as part of an initial application for registration on Form ADV, and that each adviser required to complete
Schedule H would incur six burden hours in addition to the time currently necessary to complete Form ADV. This increase
in burden will be reflected in the burden associated with rule 203&hyph;1 (Form ADV).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The burden hours associated with rule 204&hyph;1 are likely to decline after the amendments' first year. In future
years, each adviser amending its Form ADV would merely need to make any necessary changes to its existing wrap fee brochure.
The Commission estimates that the changes will take significantly less than six hours necessary to prepare the brochure
initially.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to rule 204&hyph;3 would require an adviser to deliver its Schedule H to prospective clients of the
wrap fee program, and offer to deliver it annually to existing clients of the program, in lieu of the disclosure document
required by the rule to be delivered to the adviser's other clients. Because the amendments to rule 204&hyph;3 would
merely require the delivery of a specific wrap fee disclosure document to certain clients in lieu of the delivery of
a more general disclosure document, the Commission estimates that the amendments to rule 204&hyph;3 will not increase
the burden on advisers in complying with the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General comments may be directed to Gary Waxman at the address below. Comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated
average burden hours for compliance with Commission rules and forms should be directed to John J. Lane, Associate
Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, and Gary Waxman,

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 27, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On February 4, 1994, the Amex submitted Amendment
No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify the duration of this pilot extension.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amex proposes to implement on a permanent basis its existing pilot procedures under Exchange Rule 205 requiring
execution of odd-lot market orders at the prevailing Amex quote with no differential charged. In order to permit the
pilot program to continue without interruption, the Exchange also requests that the existing program be extended
for an additional six month period in order to provide the Commission with the further opportunity, if necessary,
to assess the operation of the program beyond February 8, 1994.

The Amex original requested that this pilot program be extended for an additional three months. However, at the Commission's
request, the Amex has agreed to extend the pilot until August 8, 1994, in order to provide the Commission with further
opportunity to review the Exchange's request for permanent approval of the pilot procedures. See Amendment No. 1,

Under the pilot procedures, odd-lot market orders with no qualifying notations are executed at the Amex quotation
at the time the order is represented in the market, either by being received at the trading post or through the Exchange's
Post Execution Reporting (``PER'') System. Enhancements to the PER system have been implemented to provide for the
automatic execution of odd-lot market orders entered through PER. For purposes of the pilot program, odd-lot limit
orders that are immediately executable based on the Amex quote at the time order is received, at the trading post or
through PER, are executed in the same manner as odd-lot market orders.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange proposes that the pilot program applicable to odd-lot execution procedures be approved on a permanent
basis. The Exchange believes that current odd-lot execution procedures under the pilot program have resulted in
superior customer executions, in terms of price and time of execution, compared to previous odd-lot procedures under
Rule 205.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Odd-lot market orders as well as executable odd-lot limit orders, entered in the Exchange's PER system or directly
with the specialist after a regular opening or a reopening following a trading halt, receive an immediate automatic
execution at the displayed Amex bid or offer; odd-lot market orders entered before the opening or reopening are accumulated
and automatically executed at the price of the opening or reopening transaction without a differential.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission notes that, prior to approval of the current procedures on a pilot basis, see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
supra 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
note 4, odd-lot market orders were executed at the price of a subsequent round-lot transaction, plus or minus an odd-lot
dealer differential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because, except for odd-lot market orders entered prior to the opening, execution of such orders is not based on a subsequent
round-lot transaction, as previous market order procedures under Rule 205 required, the Amex believes odd-lot market
orders (as well as odd-lot limit orders executable at the time entered) are executed without delay at prices reflecting
market conditions at the time the order is entered, with the customer receiving a report more quickly. This is particularly
important with respect to odd-lot orders in less frequently traded issues, which, under former Rule 205 procedures,
could have been subject to significant execution delays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The added system efficiencies and greater timeliness of executions provided by the pilot procedures, together with
the opportunity for improved price executions, have resulted in significant customer benefits compared to prior
procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to permit the pilot program to continue without interruption, the Exchange also requests that the existing
program be extended for an additional six month period in order to provide the Commission with further opportunity,
if necessary, to assess the operation of the program beyond February 8, 1994.

2. Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with sections 6(b) and 11A(a)(1) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives
of section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it facilitates the economically efficient execution of odd-lot transactions,
and is intended to result in improved execution of customer orders.

IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Partial Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In regard to the six month extension of the Amex's odd-lot execution pilot program, the Commission, for the same rationale
discussed in its previous orders regarding these procedures,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular with the requirements of sections 6(b)
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 and 11A(a)(1)
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Commission believes that the revised procedures, which provide
for pricing of odd-lot market orders at the prevailing Amex quote rather than at the execution price of a subsequent
transaction, should provide investors with more timely execution of these orders. Moreover, these orders should
receive less costly executions than under the former procedures because no differential will be charged. In addition,
the Exchange has implemented enhancements to its PER system for the automatic execution of odd-lot market orders,
as set forth in the Commission's order approving the use of the pilot program procedures.

In its previous orders,
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission asked the Amex to analyze the difference in executions between using the Intermarket Trading System
(``ITS'') consolidated best bid or offer as compared with the Amex quote without the differential. Specifically,
the Commission expressed interest in whether customers are receiving the best execution, both in terms of price and
time, using the new Amex system. The Commission was also interested in the feasibility of implementing an odd-lot
pricing system using the ITS best bid or offer and no differential.

The Commission has approved amendments to the New York Stock Exchange's (``NYSE'') rules which incorporate the ITS
quote into the NYSE odd-lot pricing procedures through the use of the Best Pricing Quote (``BPQ''). See Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 27981 (May 2, 1990), 55 FR 19409 (May 9, 1990) (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;06).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response, the Amex submitted the requested information with respect to the difference in executions between the
ITS best bid or offer and the Amex quote to the Commission on January 9, 1991, April 22, 1991, October 25, 1991, February
4, 1993, August 3, 1993 and November 16, 1993.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 The Amex data indicated that the pilot procedures provide a superior execution for a substantial majority of odd-lot
executions. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is reasonable to extend the pilot for an additional six
months to enable the Commission to review fully the Amex reports and to enable the pilot to continue without interruption
during the Commission's review. The Commission, however, remains concerned that some odd-lot orders could receive
executions at less than the best available price since the Exchange's pricing formula does not include quotations
from other markets.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Nevertheless, due to the relatively low number of odd-lot market orders on the Amex,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 the percentage of Amex quotes that are worse than the ITS best bid or offer, and the benefits to customers under the pilot
program procedures as compared to the former pricing procedures, the Commission believes that it is acceptable to
continue the pilot's current pricing procedures for an additional six months. During that period, the Commission
requests that the Exchange continue to monitor the pilot and provide data on the number of Amex quotes executed that
are worse than the ITS consolidated best bid and offer and on the number of odd-lots as a percentage of total Exchange
share volume and of the total number of trades. Moreover, the Commission remains interested in the feasibility of
implementing an odd-lot pricing system using the ITS best bid and offer and no differential. Accordingly, the Commission
requests that the Amex include in its monitoring report the feasibility and cost of developing such a plan, along with
a projected time frame for potential implementation. The Commission requests that the Amex submit its report on these
matters by May 8, 1994.

See letter from Karen A. Aluise, Assistant Vice President, BSE to Sandra Sciole, Branch Chief, Exchange Regulation,
Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated January 13, 1994. The BSE submitted a letter to the Commission adding
language to the proposal and its corresponding exhibits which clarifies that the BSE's insider trading rules are
designed to require members and associated persons to attempt to detect securities transactions which they reasonably
believe may have involved the misuse of material, non-public information. In this regard, this letter amendment
makes nine changes to the proposal and its exhibits. This letter amendment deleted the last sentence in paragraph
1 of Exhibit 4 which stated, ``This list shall be updated as associated persons leave or join the firm.'' It also added
``trade confirmations and'' after the word ``duplicate'' in the first sentence in Exhibit 4, paragraph 1a, and it
changed the date in Exhibit 3, the Sample Membership Bulletin, from March 31, 1994 to April 30, 1994.

In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to supplement section 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
and the ITSFEA, by requiring every member organization of the Exchange to establish maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information by such member
and any person associated with the member. In addition, it requires that all members who are required to file SEC Form
X&hyph;17A&hyph;5 (``FOCUS Reports'') with the Exchange on an annual basis must submit with their FOCUS Reports
a signed statement of compliance with this rule. Finally, it establishes minimum standards for compliance with the
record-keeping requirements of this rule, and requires disclosure by members and associated persons to the Exchange's
Surveillance Department of any securities transaction that the firm reasonably believes may have involved the misuse
of material, non-public information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supplementary Material .02 defines conduct that would constitute the misuse of material, non-public information,
including, but not limited to, (1) trading in any securities, or in any related securities, options or other derivative
securities of a corporation while in possession of material non-public information concerning that corporation;
(2) trading in any underlying security or related options or other derivative securities concerning imminent transactions
in the underlying security or related securities; and (3) disclosing to another person or entity information described
in (1) or (2) above for the purpose of facilitating the misuse of such material, non-public information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope of the aforementioned definition is intended to be consistent with the goal of section 15(f) of the Act and
ITSFEA to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information. This definition should be broad enough to encompass
frontrunning, trading on the basis of material corporate inside information, tipping and misappropriating material
corporate inside information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Supplementary Material .02 defines the term ``associated person'' or ``person associated with a member'' as any
partner, officer, director, or branch manager of a member (or any person occupying a similar status or performing
similar functions), any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
a member, or any employee of a member.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supplementary Material .03 requires members to establish, maintain and enforce certain policies and procedures
pursuant to this rule. Specifically, members would be required to (1) advise all associated persons in writing of
the prohibition against the misuse of material, non-public information; (2) maintain for at least three years, the
first two years in an easily accessible place, signed statements from the member and all associated persons of the
member, affirming their awareness of and agreement to abide by the above mentioned prohibitions; (3) maintain for
at least three years, the first two years in an easily accessible place, account statements of all brokerage accounts
(excluding mutual fund and money market accounts) in which an associated person either has a direct or indirect interest
or makes investment decisions; (4) periodically review all such brokerage accounts for the purpose of detecting
those securities transactions that the firm reasonably believes may have involved the misuse of material, non-public
information; and (5) identify and document business dealings the member may have with publicly traded corporations
that may result in the member receiving material, non-public information.The standards contained in .03 are intended
to be minimum standards for compliance with the record-keeping requirements of the Act and this rule. Adherence to
these standards will not necessarily constitute compliance with the Act and the rule for all members. The adequacy
of any one member's policies and procedures will depend on the nature of that member's business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supplementary Material .04 and the member bulletin (see Exhibit 3) describe a set of forms, denominated as the ``Sample
ITSFEA Compliance Procedures,'' which may be used by ``eligible members'' to satisfy the record-keeping and filing
requirements of the Act and this rule. ``Eligible members,'' are member organizations and sole Exchange members
that do not carry or introduce customer accounts and for whom the Exchange is the designated examining authority (``DEA'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the Sample ITSFEA Compliance Procedures require: (1) All associated persons to disclose each securities
account in which they have a direct or indirect financial interest, or make investment decisions; (2) all associated
persons to disclose whether they are an officer, director or 10% shareholder in a company whose shares are publicly
traded: (3) acknowledgement by all associated persons that they understand and will abide by the prohibition against
the misuse of material, non-public information; (4) written statement by a senior officer, partner or sole proprietor
that such person ensures that all of the ITSFEA compliance procedures are being followed, including the periodic
review of all accounts and trading activities of associated persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sample ITSFEA Compliance Procedures are intended to constitute the minimum policies and procedures required
by the Act and this rule; their use does not ensure compliance with the record-keeping and filing requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade through the prevention of fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.

The temporary policy states that in an effort to ensure accurate executions to the customers, the Committee on Floor
Procedures has decided that once the analyst's report is broadcast, the auto-execution system will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turned off and all issues will be executed manually. After the issue is named, and two members from the Committee on
Floor Procedure agree that there is no longer an influx of orders in this issue, the system will be set back to automatic
execution. All specialists are reminded that during the period that the system is set to manual, it is their responsibility
to properly price all orders within the context of the CHX rules. The Committee on Floor Procedure and Surveillance
will review all trades in the affected issues to insure that proper reports are given to the customers. This will be
on a trial procedure only.

In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recently, the Exchange has experienced an abnormal influx of orders through the MAX system at the same time that a certain
analyst' report is broadcast on cable T.V. Because of the near instantaneous automatic execution feature of the MAX
system, the executions of those orders are taking place before the quotes for those stocks can be updated to reflect
the analyst's comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MAX system automates the requirements of Rule 37 of Article XX which guarantees executions at the best market up
to a certain size for agency orders. Paragraph 7 under Rule 37 allows specialists and floor brokers to seek relief from
the requirements of the BEST system in unusual trading situations.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Committee on Floor Procedures has determined that the broadcast of the above described report creates unusual
trading situations that warrant relief from the automatic execution feature for a short period of time so that proper
quotes can be entered. As a result, the purpose of the proposed rule change is to published the Committee on Floor Procedure's
determination to all trading floor members.

CHX Rule 37, Paragraph 7 states that in unusual trading situations, a specialist or floor broker may seek relief from

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

On February 9, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')

<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change to permit two Floor Officials to waive, on a case-by-case basis, the required maximum bid/ask
differentials for options when the bid/ask differential in the security underlying an options contract is greater
than one-half of a point. Notice of the proposed rule change appeared in the

In Amendment No. 1, the Exchange proposes to: (1) Move the last sentence from Rule 6.37(b)(1) to Rule 6.36(b)(3); and
(2) delete the references to in-the-money options series from the language originally proposed to be added to Rule
6.37(b)(3). Letter from Michael Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office
of Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated February 7, 1994 (``Amendment No.

The Exchange proposes to amend its rule establishing the maximum bid/ask differentials that may be created in making
a market in options contracts. Rule 6.37(b)(1) currently provides, for example, that a Market Maker may bid and/or
offer so as to create differences of no more than one-quarter of a point between the bid and the offer when the bid is less
than $2. The current rule also provides, however, that the Exchange's Options Floor Trading Committee (``Committee'')
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 may establish maximum spreads other than those specified. Additionally, Rule 6.37(b)(1) also currently provides
that in the event the bid/ask differential in the underlying security is greater than the bid/ask differential contained
in the rule, the permissible price differential for any in-the-money option series may be identical to those in the
underlying security market.

Under the proposal, the last sentence from Rule 6.37(b)(1), which provides an exemption from the maximum specified
bid/ask differentials for in-the-money options series in certain circumstances, would be moved to Rule 6.37(b)(3).
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, new language is proposed to be added to Rule 6.37(b)(3) which would allow two Floor Officials to waive
the requirements of Rule 6.37(b)(1) for at-the-money and out-of-the-money options series, on a case-by-case basis,
when the bid/ask differential for the underlying security is greater than one-half of a point. In such instances,
the spreads for at-the-money and out-of-the-money options series may be, at most, one-half as wide as the bid/ask
differential in the underlying security in the primary market. The proposed rule also provides that exemptions granted
pursuant to the rule are subject to Committee review.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is designed to facilitate transactions in securities,
to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and to promote
just and equitable principles of trade. Specifically, by incorporating objective standards into the rule and providing
Floor Officials with the discretion to grant exemptions when those standards are met, the proposal will give Market
Makers more flexibility to apply to alter the maximum bid/ask differential when quoting options where the market
in the underlying security is illiquid and therefore has wider spreads. The Commission notes that under the current
rule, Market Makers may already obtain approval to alter the spreads specified in the rule for any options series.
Such approval, however, must be obtained from the Committee at either a regular or special meeting of the Committee.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal would alleviate any potential delay in granting Market Makers requests to adjust their spreads by permitting
such relief to be granted by two Floor Officials rather than the full Committee.

Although the Commission recognizes that the proposal could result in more requests by Market Makers to obtain permission
to increase maximum spreads because such requests could be granted by two Floor Officials as opposed to the full Committee,
the Commission believes that the rule ensures that exemptions can only be granted in limited circumstances. First,
an exemption can only be granted for at-the-money and out-of-the-money options series where the spread in the underlying
security is greater than one-half of a point. Second, even with the exemption for the bid/ask differentials for at-the-money
and out-of-the-money options series, the maximum spread for those series can be at most, one-half as wide as the spread
in the underlying security. Finally, any exemption granted by the Floor Officials will be subject to Committee review.
This review authority will allow the full Committee to monitor the use of the exemptions and to detect any situations
where, for example, exemptions have been improperly granted by certain Floor Officials, and to take appropriate
steps to prevent subsequent abuses of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Amendment No. 1 merely clarifies that the intent of the proposed rule change is to provide objective standards for
allowing Floor Officials to grant exemptions from Rule 6.37(b)(1) for at-the-money and out-of-the-money options
series, not to change the current rule with respect to the exemption for in-the-money options series. Moreover, the
Commission notes that this proposal was published for the full 21-day comment period and no comments were received
by the Commission. Therefore, the Commission believes it is consistent with sections 6(b)(5)
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 and 19(b)(2)
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on an accelerated basis.

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Phlx proposes to adopt Commentary .19 to Phlx Rule 229 in order to prohibit the unbundling of certain types of orders.
PACE is the Exchange's automated order routing, delivery and execution system for equity securities. Pursuant to
Phlx Rule 229, customer orders entered through PACE are entitled to certain execution guarantees. For example, limit
orders for less than 600 shares become due an execution once 1,000 shares of that security prints at the limit price
or better on the New York Stock Exchange (``primary market guarantee'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unbundling occurs when a member organization or its agent splits a larger sized order into two or more small-sized
orders to take advantage of PACE execution guarantees for orders of less than 600 shares. The Phlx proposal would prohibit
members from soliciting their customers to unbundle orders for the purpose of taking advantage of these guarantees.
However, the proposed prohibition against unbundling does not extend to any orders broken up by a non-member customer
at his or her own discretion as long as the customer was not solicited to do so by the Phlx member firm for the aforementioned
purpose.

2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with section 6(b)(5),
in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling,
processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, as well as to protect investors and
the public interest, consistent with section 6(b)(5).

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. First Transamerica is a stock life insurance company incorporated under te laws of New York in 1986.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Separate Account was established by First Transamerica on November 10, 1993. Schwab will serve as the distributor
and principal underwriter of the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Contract is a flexible purchase payment deferred variable annuity which can be purchased on a non-tax qualified
basis or used as a funding vehicle in connection with certain retirement plans which qualify for favorable income
tax treatment. Purchase payments under the Contracts will be allocated to one or more sub-accounts of the Separate
Account. The initial purchase payment under a Contract must be at least $5,000. Additional purchase payments of at
least $1,000 each may be made at any time before the annuity date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each Contract contains death benefit provisons that provide a benefit equal to the greatest of (a) the sum of all
purchase payments, less the sum of all withdrawals and any applicable premium or similar taxes, or (b) the account
value, as of the end of the valuation period during which the later of (1) due proof of death is received and (2) the receipt
of a written notice of the method of settlement elected by the beneficiary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A Transfer fee of $10 will be deducted under the Contract for each transfer in excess of 10 per Contract year. First
Transamerica will also deduct an annual Contract charge of $25 for each Contract at the end of each Contract Year for
administrative services. While First Transamerica does not currently impose an Administrative Expense Charge,
it reserves the right to deduct such a charge on a daily basis in the future from the assets of the Separate Account. However,
the Administrative Expense Charge is guaranteed not to exceed an effective annual rate of 0.15% of the average net
assets held in each sub-account. First Transamerica does not anticipate any profit from these charges. First Transamerica
will deduct the administrative charges in reliance upon and in compliance with Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. First Transamerica will deduct any premium taxes related to a particular Contract from purchase payments, upon
surrender, or upon annuitization, in reliance on Rule 26a&hyph;2 under the 1940 Act. No charges are currently made
for federal, state, or local taxes other than premium taxes. However, First Transamerica may deduct such taxes in
the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. There are no charges or deductions for sales load from purchase payments, Separate Account assets, or upon withdrawal
of surrender of a Contract. First Transamerica will incur expenses relating to the sale of the Contracts which will
be paid from its general assets.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. For assuming certain mortality and expenses risks under the Contracts, First Transamerica will assess a mortality
and expense risk charge at an annual rate of 0.85% of the value of net assets in the Separate Account. Of this amount,
approximately 0.30% represents mortality risk and approximately 0.55% is estimated to be attributable to expense
risks. This charge will not increase. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs
and assumed risks, the loss will fall on First Transamerica. Conversely, if the charge is more than sufficient to cover
costs, any excess will be profit to First Transamerica. First Transamerica currently anticipates a profit from this
charge. According to Applicants, the mortality risk borne by First Transamerica arises from its contractual obligation
to make annuity payments (determined in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the
Contract) regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual annuitant may live. This undertaking assures that
neither an annuitant's own longevity, nor an improvement in general life expectancy, will adversely affect the periodic
annuity payments. First Transamerica also assumes a risk in connection with the payment of death benefits, since
the death benefit could be higher than the account value. The expense risk assumed by First Transamerica is the risk
that administrative costs will be greater than anticipated, or exceed the amount recovered through the administrative
charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act require that all payments received under a periodic payment plan
certificate be held by a qualified trustee or a custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to
the depositor or principal underwriter except for the payment of a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the
Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants request exemptions from
those Sections to the extent necessary to permit the assessment of the charge for mortality and expenses risks in the
manner described in the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants submit that First Transamerica is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality
and expense risks. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts is consistent
with the protection of investors because it is a reasonable and proper insurance charge. As described above, in return
for this amount First Transamerica assumes certain risks under the Contracts. The mortality and expense risk charge
is a reasonable charge to compensate First Transamerica for the risk that annuitants under the Contracts will live
longer than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts, for the risk that death
benefit proceeds will be greater than the Account Value, and for the risk that administrative expenses will be greater
than anticipated or exceed amounts derived from the administrative charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. First Transamerica represents that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice
for comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon First Transamerica's
analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors
as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, death benefit guarantees, guaranteed annuity
rates and other policy options. First Transamerica will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the
Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results
of, its comparative survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion
of such profit may be viewed as being offset by distribution expenses. First Transamerica represents that there is
a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Separate Account
and the Contract owners. Applicants also represent that the basis for this conclusion is set forth in a memorandum
which will be maintained by First Transamerica at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. First Transamerica represents that the Separate Account will only invest in management investment companies
which undertake, in the event any such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses,
to have a board of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate
and approve any such plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, their request for exemptions from sections
26(a)(2))C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Applicants' Representations

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. By order dated September 29, 1993 (Investment Company Act Release No. 19747) (the ``Order''), the Commission,
pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, provided Applicants exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act. The exemptions were granted, to the extent necessary, to allow Applicant to deduct from the Account
the mortality and expense risk charge imposed under certain flexible premium individual deferred variable annuity
contracts (the ``Contracts'') funded through the Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants request that the Order be amended. Specifically, Applicants propose modification of the death benefit
under the Contracts. Currently, the death benefit provides for, among other things, interest accumulations at four
percent prior to the Contract owner's attained age 80. Applicants propose that the death benefit be modified to provide
instead for such accumulations prior to the Contract anniversary next following the Contract owner's 75th birthday.
Applicants request that the Order be amended to the extent necessary to recognize the proposed modification to the
Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

serves as a funding medium for the Contracts. The application states that the Account meets the definition of a ``separate
account'' under the federal securities laws. The Account is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as a

5. Lincoln Financial, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lincoln Benefit, is the distributor of the Contracts. Lincoln
Financial is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is a member of
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Contracts are available for retirement plans which qualify for federal tax advantages under the Internal Revenue
Code and for those plans which do not qualify for advantageous treatment. The Contracts require a minimum initial
premium payment of $1,200. Additional premium payments must be in amounts of at least $100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. If the owner of a Contract dies prior to the annuity date and the Contract is in force, Lincoln Benefit will, upon receipt
of due proof of death, pay a death benefit. At a minimum, the death benefit is equal to the greater of: (a) All purchase
payments less prior withdrawals, accumulated at 4% per year prior to the Contract anniversary next following the
Contract owner's 75th birthday, and at 0% per year thereafter (the ``Floor Value''); or (b) the Contract value less
applicable premium tax.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 If the Contract value on the seventh Contract anniversary is greater than the Floor Value, the Floor Value will be increased
to the level of the Contract value. If this increase occurs, Floor Value for the eighth Contract year and for subsequent
years will then be calculated using the increased value. The Contract owner may select the form of annuity from four
annuity options described in the registration statement for the Account.

8. One transfer among subaccounts is permitted monthly without charge. For each transfer among subaccounts in excess
of once monthly, a transfer fee of $25 is assessed. The transfer fee is deducted from Contract values which remain in
the subaccount or subaccounts from which the transfer is made. Applicants represent that the transfer fee is designed
to be at cost with no margin included for profit. Lincoln Benefit is currently waiving this fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicants impose an annual Contract maintenance charge of $25 per Contract year. Applicants guarantee that this
charge will not increase and state that the charge reimburses Lincoln Benefit for expenses incurred in maintaining
the Contracts. This charge will be deducted on each Contract anniversary prior to the annuity date, but is not imposed
during the annuity period. If a Contract is surrendered, the charge is assessed as of the surrender date without proration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Lincoln Benefit deducts an administrative expense charge equal to an annual effective rate of .15% of the net asset
value of the subaccount. The application states that this charge will compensate Lincoln Benefit for administering
the Contracts and the Account. This charge is assessed during both the accumulation and the annuity periods. Applicants
state that the Contract maintenance charge and the administrative expense charge are designed, in the aggregate,
to be at cost with no margin included for profit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. A contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'') of up to 7% of the amount withdrawn is imposed on certain
surrenders or withdrawals of Contract value. No Sales Charge is applied on annuitization or on the payment of a death
benefit unless the settlement option chosen is payment over a period certain of less than five years. The Sales Charge
is deducted from the Contract value remaining after withdrawal so that the reduction in Contract value as a result
of a withdrawal will be greater than the withdrawal amount requested. Amounts obtained from imposition of the Sales
Charge will be used to pay sales commissions and other promotional or distribution expenses associated with the marketing
of the Contracts. To the extent that the Sales Charge does not cover all sales commissions and other promotional or
distribution expenses, Applicants state that Lincoln Benefit may use any of its corporate assets, including potential
profit from the mortality and expense risk charge, to make up the shortfall.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Lincoln Benefit will impose a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets
of the Account to compensate Lincoln Benefit for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the
Contracts. Approximately .85% of the 1.25% charge is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately .40% is attributable
to expense risk. Applicants represent that the charge for mortality and expense risks will not increase. If the mortality
and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risk, Lincoln Benefit will bear the loss.
Conversely, if the charge exceeds costs, this excess will be profit to Lincoln Benefit. If Lincoln Benefit realizes
a gain from the charge for mortality and expense risks, the amount of such gain may be used in the discretion of Lincoln
Benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Applicants state that the mortality risk borne by Lincoln Benefit consists of: (a) Bearing the risk that the life
expectancy of an annuitant will be greater than that assumed in the guaranteed annuity purchase rates; (b) waiving
the Sales Charge upon the death of a Contract owner; and (c) providing a death benefit prior to the annuity date. Applicants
state that the expense risk assumed by Lincoln Benefit is the risk that the costs of administering the Contracts and
the Account will exceed amounts received by Lincoln Benefit through imposition of the Contract maintenance charge
and the administrative expense charge.

Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, issue an amended order granting
exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the
daily charge for the mortality and expense risk. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part,
prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic
payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified
bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal
underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping
and other administrative services of a character normally performed by the bank itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants assert that the charge for mortality and expense risks is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed
by Lincoln Benefit under the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants represent that the charge of 1.25% for the mortality and expense risks assumed by Lincoln Benefit is
within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation
is based upon their analysis of publicly available information about similar industry practices, taking into consideration
such factors as: Current charge levels; charge level guarantees; benefits provided; and guaranteed annuity rates.
Applicants represent that Lincoln Benefit will maintain at its home office, available to the Commission, a memorandum
setting forth in detail the methodology used in determining that the level of risk charge is within the range of industry
practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants represent that Lincoln Benefit has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed
distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Account and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion
is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by Lincoln Benefit and will be made available to the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Lincoln Benefit also represents that the Account will invest only in management investment companies which undertake,
in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have
such plan formulated and approved by the company's board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons
of such company within the meaning of the 1940 Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with
the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants request an order that would amend a prior order that permitted the Trust to impose a contingent deferred
sales charge (``CDSC'') on certain redemptions of Trust shares. The prior order was granted to the Trust and Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. (``Shearson''), the Trust's former sponsor and distributor. Since the order was granted, Shearson's
assets were sold to Primerica Corporation and its subsidiary Smith Barney Shearson, and Smith Barney Shearson became
the sponsor and underwriter of the Trust. Applicants request to continue the relief granted in the prior order and
to extend the relief to Smith Barney Shearson and certain investment companies for which Smith Barney Shearson serves
as investment adviser or principal underwriter.

Applicants' Representations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Trust is an open-end management investment company that was organized as a business trust under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts on October 17, 1991. To date, the Trust consists of four series: Smith Barney Shearson
Limited Maturity Treasury Fund, Smith Barney Shearson Limited Maturity Municipals Fund, Smith Barney Shearson
Intermediate Maturity California Municipals Fund, and Smith Barney Shearson Intermediate Maturity New York Municipals
Fund (the ``Funds'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On March 12, 1993, American Express Company and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Shearson, entered into
an asset purchase agreement with Primerica Corporation and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. Inc. (as renamed, Smith Barney Shearson). Under the agreement, American Express sold substantially
all of the assets of Shearson and the Asset Management Divisions of Shearson to Smith Barney Shearson and its designated
affiliates. Upon the closing of the sale on July 31, 1993, Smith Barney Shearson became the sponsor and distributor
of the Trust and Greenwich Street Advisers Division of Mutual Management Corporation, an affiliate of Smith Barney
Shearson, replaced Shearson Lehman Advisors as the Trust's investment adviser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Prior to the sale transaction, investment companies sponsored by Shearson, including the Trust, received orders
of exemption from various provisions of the Act. At the request of Shearson and Smith Barney, the Commission's Division
of Investment Management informed Shearson and Smith Barney that the Division would not recommend that the Commission
take any enforcement action against them if the Funds operate under the terms of a prior order until the earlier of (a)
the date the prior order is renewed by the Commission pursuant to a renewal order specifying Smith Barney and its subsidiaries
or affiliates as applicants or (b) June 8, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 This application is being filed pursuant to that no-action letter to continue and renew an order that permitted the
Trust to assess a CDSC on redemptions of the Trust's shares (the ``Income Trust Order'').

4. Applicants further request that any relief granted extend to Smith Barney Shearson and any future series of the
Trust or any other open-end investment company for which Smith Barney Shearson, or any entity controlled by, or under
common control with Smith Barney Shearson, serves as investment adviser or principal underwriter that issues shares
that are identical in all material respects to those described in the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Under the Income Trust Order, the Trust (a) offers shares subject to a maximum sales charge upon purchase of 1.25%
(the ``Upfront Charge'') that is reduced on purchases of $50,000 or more; (b) has instituted a shareholder servicing
plan in accordance with rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act; and (c) assesses a 1% CDSC on certain redemptions of shares made
within one year of their purchase. Under the amended order, the CDSC would continue to be imposed on that portion of
a redemption that causes the current value of Fund shares to fall below the total dollar amount of payments for the purchase
of those shares (less any applicable Upfront Charge) made by the shareholder during the preceding year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. No CDSC would be imposed to the extent that the net asset value of the shares redeemed does not exceed (a) the current
net asset value of shares purchased more than one year prior to the redemption (``Old Shares Value''), plus (b) the
current net asset value of shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distribution (``Reinvestment
Shares Value''), plus (c) increases in the net asset value of the shares above purchase payments (less any applicable
Upfront Charge) made during the preceding year (``Appreciation Value'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In effecting a particular redemption request of shares made by a shareholder, the Trust would continue first to
redeem an amount that represents Appreciation Value. The Trust next would redeem an amount that represents Reinvestment
Shares Value, and then an amount that represents Old Shares Value. The amount by which a redemption exceeds the total
of Appreciation Value, Reinvestment Shares Value, and Old Shares Value would be subject to the CDSC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In no event would the maximum amount of the CDSC assessed upon the redemption of shares plus the amount of any Upfront
Charge paid with respect to the shares exceed the maximum sales charge that could have been imposed at the time the shares
were purchased under Article III, section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practice adopted by the National Association
of Securities Dealers, of which Smith Barney Shearson is a member.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Under the amended order, the CDSC would be waived with respect to: (a) Automatic cash withdrawals by a shareholder
in amounts equal to or less than 2% per month of the value of the shareholder's shares at the time that the shareholder's
participation in the withdrawal plan commences; (b) redemptions in connection with: (i) lump-sum or other distributions
from a qualified corporate or self-employed retirement plan following retirement, termination of employment,
death, disability or following attainment of age 591/2 of a plan participant, (ii) the hardship of a plan participant
to the extent permitted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code''), (iii) a loan made by a qualified corporate
or self-employed retirement plan to a participating employee, (iv) distributions and withdrawals from retirement
plans or individual retirement accounts (``IRAs'') or custodial accounts under section 403(b)(7) of the Code following
attainment of age 591/2; and (v) a tax-free return of an excess contribution to an IRA; (c) redemptions of shares that
are acquired as a result of an exchange into any Fund from any fund in the same ``group of investment companies'' as defined
in rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act as the Trust and that are sold subject to a sales charge upon purchase (the ``Exchange
Group of Funds''); (d) involuntary redemptions; and (e) redemptions by (i) employees of Travelers Inc. (formerly
known as Primerica Corporation) and its subsidiaries (including Smith Barney Shearson), American Express and its
subsidiaries, and The Boston Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, IRAs for those employees, employee benefit plans
for those employees, and the spouses and minor children of those employees, (ii) accounts managed by investment advisory
subsidiaries of Travelers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and (iii) directors, trustees or
general partners of any investment company for which Smith Barney Shearson serves as distributor. In accordance
with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act, a CDSC will not be imposed on exchanges between a Fund and any fund in the Exchange
Group of Funds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Under the amended order, a shareholder who has redeemed shares of a Fund and who reinvests all or part of the redemption
proceeds in shares of any other Fund within 180 days of the redemption will continue to receive a proportionate credit
(in the form of additional shares of the Fund into which the reinvestment is being made) for the CDSC imposed on the prior
redemption. Also, a shareholder who has redeemed shares of a Fund and who reinvests all or part of the redemption proceeds
within 30 days of the redemption in shares of any fund in the Exchange Group of Funds will continue to receive a proportionate
credit (in the form of additional shares of the fund into which the reinvestment is being made) for any CDSC imposed
on the prior redemption. In each case, the amount of the credit would be funded by Smith Barney Shearson out of a ``house''
account into which Smith Barney Shearson would maintain, on an ongoing basis, a portion of the proceeds from CDSCs
assessed to shareholders. The account will at all times be maintained in an amount sufficient to provide all credits
to which shareholders are entitled.

1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d)
of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to permit the Funds to continue to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of
the shares as described above and to permit the Funds to waive the CDSC with respect to certain types of redemptions.
Applicants believe that the contingent nature of the proposed charge places the purchaser in a better position than
if a sales load were imposed at the time of sale, since in the case of the CDSC the shareholder enjoys the possibility
that he or she will have to pay only a reduced sales charge, or no sales charge at all. Applicants further believe that
the imposition of the CDSC permits the Funds' shareholders to have the advantage of greater investment dollars working
for them from the time of their purchase of shares of the Funds than if a sales load were imposed at the time of purchase.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's
Public Reference Branch.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Transamerica is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of California in 1906.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Separate Account was established by Transamerica on September 28, 1993. Schwab will serve as the distributor
and principal underwriter of the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Contract is a flexible purchase payment deferred variable annuity which can be purchased on a non-tax qualified
basis or used as a funding vehicle in connection with certain retirement plans which qualify for favorable income
tax treatment. Purchase payments under the Contracts will be allocated to one or more sub-accounts of the Separate
Account. The initial purchase payment under a Contract must be at least $5,000. Additional purchase payments of at
least $1,000 each may be made at any time before the annuity date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each Contract contains death benefit provisions that provide a benefit equal to the greatest of (a) the sum of all
purchase payments, less the sum of all withdrawals and any applicable premium or similar taxes, or (b) the account
value, as of the end of the valuation period during which the later of (1) due proof of death is received and (2) the receipt
of a written notice of the method of settlement elected by the beneficiary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A Transfer fee of $10 will be deducted under the Contract for each transfer in excess of 10 per Contract year. Transamerica
will also deduct an annual Contract charge of $25 for each Contract at the end of each Contract Year for administrative
services. While Transamerica does not currently impose an Administrative Expense Charge, it reserves the right
to deduct such a charge on a daily basis in the future from the assets of the Separate Account. However, the Administrative
Expense Charge is guaranteed not to exceed an effective annual rate of 0.15% of the average net assets held in each sub-account.
Transamerica does not anticipate any profit from these charges. Transamerica will deduct the administrative charges
in reliance upon and in compliance with Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Transamerica will deduct any premium taxes related to a particular Contract from purchase payments, upon surrender,
or upon annuitization, in reliance on Rule 26a&hyph;2 under the 1940 Act. No charges are currently made for federal,
state, or local taxes other than premium taxes. However, Transamerica may deduct such taxes in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. There are no charges or deductions for sales load from purchase payments, Separate Account assets, or upon withdrawal
or surrender of a Contract. Transamerica will incur expenses relating to the sale of the Contracts which will be paid
from its general assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. For assuming certain mortality and expenses risks under the Contracts, Transamerica will assess a mortality and
expense risk charge at an annual rate of 0.85% of the value of net assets in the Separate Account. Of this amount, approximately
0.30% represents mortality risk and approximately 0.55% is estimated to be attributable to expense risks. This charge
will not increase. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks,
the loss will fall on Transamerica. Conversely, if the charge is more than sufficient to cover costs, any excess will
be profit to Transamerica. Transamerica currently anticipates a profit from this charge. According to Applicants,
the mortality risk borne by Transamerica arises from its contractual obligation to make annuity payments (determined
in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the Contract) regardless of how long all annuitants
or any individual annuitant may live. This undertaking assures that neither an annuitant's own longevity, nor an
improvement in general life expectancy, will adversely affect the periodic annuity payments. Transamerica also
assumes a risk in connection with the payment of death benefits, since the death benefit could be higher than the account
value. The expense risk assumed by Transamerica is the risk that administrative costs will be greater than anticipated,
or exceed the amount recovered through the administrative charges.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act require that all payments received under a periodic payment plan
certificate be held by a qualified trustee or a custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to
the depositor or principal underwriter except for the payment of a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the
Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants request exemptions from
those Sections to the extent necessary to permit the assessment of the charge for mortality and expenses risks in the
manner described in the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants submit that Transamerica is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and
expense risks. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts is consistent
with the protection of investors because it is a reasonable and proper insurance charge. As described above, in return
for this amount Transamerica assumes certain risks under the Contracts. The mortality and expense risk charge is
a reasonable charge to compensate Transamerica for the risk that annuitants under the Contracts will live longer
than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts, for the risk that death benefit
proceeds will be greater than the Account Value, and for the risk that administrative expenses will be greater than
anticipated or exceed amounts derived from the administrative charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Transamerica represents that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for
comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon Transamerica's analysis
of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current
charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, death benefit guarantees, guaranteed annuity rates and
other policy options. Transamerica will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a
memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its
comparative survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion
of such profit may be viewed as being offset by distribution expenses. Transamerica represents that there is a reasonable
likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Separate Account and the Contract
owners. Applicants also represent that the basis for this conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained
by Transamerica at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Transamerica represents that the Separate Account will only invest in management investment companies which
undertake, in the event any such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses, to
have a board of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate and
approve any such plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1.

Conclusion

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, their request for exemptions from sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Property Claims Against the Government of Hungary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of State has recently received the following information from the Government of Hungary about filing
claims for property restitution or compensation under Hungary's domestic laws remedying illegal expropriation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Hungarian Parliament has reopened the period within which claims for property restitution or compensation may
be filed with the Government of Hungary under existing Hungarian property restitution laws. Persons who did not recover
under these laws because of their failure to file by the previous deadlines may now file a claim for compensation or
restitution with appropriate Hungarian authorities. These claims must be filed between February 15, 1994 and March
15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Apart from the new filing period, Hungary's property restitution laws remain unchanged. They continue to provide
only partial compensation or restitution in the form of property coupons, and eligibility remains limited to persons
who meet certain citizenship requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons desiring further information about these developments or assistance relating to the filing of a claim under
Hungary's domestic laws should contact the Hungarian Embassy, 3910 Shoemaker Street, NW., Washington, DC 20008.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11411), as amended, and
HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 581, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property
that HUD reviewed in 1993 for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information
provided to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property
controlled by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 24 CFR 581.3(b), landholding agencies are required to notify HUD by December 31, 1993, the current availability
status and classification of each property controlled by the Agencies that were published by HUD as suitable and available
which remain available for application for use by the homeless. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 24 CFR 581.8(d), HUD publishes a list of those properties reported by the Agencies and a list of suitable/unavailable
properties including the reasons why they are not available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A&hyph;10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443&hyph;2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).
