<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends 7 CFR parts 1 and 2 and 36 CFR part 223 by adding a new subpart M to 7 CFR part 1 establishing rules of practice
governing the adjudication of sourcing area applications pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage
Relief Act of 1990; by deleting, in 7 CFR part 2, the reference to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief
Act and adding, in its place, a reference to the rules of practice established by this rule; and by making technical
amendments to 36 CFR part 223 to conform it to the rules of practice established by this rule.

The Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (Act) prohibits the export of unprocessed Federal
timber west of the 100th meridian in the 48 contiguous states and the substitution of such unprocessed Federal timber
for unprocessed private timber from the west that is exported. The Act allows a person with an approved sourcing area
to export unprocessed private timber originating from outside of the sourcing area while purchasing Federal timber
within the sourcing area. The Act states that the Secretary shall approve or disapprove sourcing areas on the record
and after an opportunity for a hearing. Therefore, formal adjudication is required under the Administrative Procedure
Act. The Act also requires that reviews of sourcing areas be conducted at least every 5 years in accordance with the
procedures of the Act. Pursuant to section 556 of the Administrative Procedure Act, adjudications of sourcing area
applications and formal reviews of sourcing areas will be subject to the rules of practice adopted by this rulemaking.
Informal reviews of sourcing areas will be conducted in accordance with 36 CFR 223.191(e).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act (Act), enacted August 20, 1990, prohibits both the export
of unprocessed Federal logs originating west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 states and the substitution
of such unprocessed Federal logs for unprocessed private logs originating west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous
48 states that are exported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act exempts persons with approved ``sourcing areas'' from the prohibition against substitution in certain circumstances.
A sourcing area is the area from which an owner/manufacturer of logs obtains logs for his or her mill. To be approved,
a sourcing area must be geographically and economically separate from any geographic area where the person harvests
private timber for export. A person with an approved ``sourcing area'' may export unprocessed private logs whose
origin is outside of the sourcing area, while continuing to purchase Federal logs within the sourcing area. Private
logs originating from within the sourcing area may not be exported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 490(c) of the Act states that the Secretary is to approve or disapprove the application, ``on the record and
after an opportunity for a hearing'' 4 months after submission of a sourcing area application. Section 554 of Title
5, United States Code requires a formal adjudicatory process when a statute requires a determination to be made ``on
the record and after opportunity for an agency hearing.'' This rule amends 7 CFR part 1 by adding rules of practice governing
sourcing area applications, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 556. Specific rules governing sourcing area adjudications are
necessary because of the short time in which the statute requires decisions to be made (4 months), and the unique procedural
posture of sourcing area applications; i.e., sourcing area applications are submitted by a party other than the agency,
expect in certain cases, pursuant to a review of a sourcing area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also amends 7 CFR 2.35 by deleting the words ``in sourcing area adjudications under the Forest Resources
Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.)'', and adding, in their place, the words ``in adjudication proceedings subject to the `Rules of Practice Governing

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the amendments to 7 CFR parts 1 and 2, adopted by this rule, it is necessary in this rule, to make technical amendments
to 36 CFR part 223 to conform it to the rules of practice, established by this rule, which govern the adjudication of
sourcing area applications pursuant to the Act. This rule amends the rules governing initial sourcing applicants,
published in an interim rule at 55 FR 48572 (Nov. 20, 1990). Specifically to conform the procedures in the interim rule
to this rule, for ongoing applications, 36 CFR 223.190 is amended as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Section 223.190(g) is revised to state that the application review process will be conducted pursuant to the Rules
of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant
to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 223.190(h) (introductory text) and (h)(1)&hyph;(3) are removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 223.190(h)(4) is redesignated as 36 CFR 223.190(h) and is revised to state that a final decision will be
issued within four (4) months of receipt of the sourcing area application or initiation date of the formal review of
the sourcing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Section 223.190(h)(5) is redesignated as 36 CFR 223.190(i), and 36 CFR 223.190(h)(5)(i)&hyph;(iv) are redesignated
as 36 CFR 223.190(i), (1)&hyph;(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Newly redesignated 36 CFR 223.190(i)(1) is amended by deleting the words ``approving official'' and adding, in
their place, the words ``the Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also makes technical amendments to 36 CFR 223.191(e) to conform the sourcing area review procedures to the
rules of practice adopted in this rule (36 CFR 223.191 was published in a final rulemaking at 56 FR 65834, December 19,
1991). Specifically, this rule removes from 36 CFR 223.191(e) the words ``deciding official'' and adds, in their
place, the words ``the Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer.'' This rule also amends the
following sentence in paragraph (e), ``The deciding official shall, on the record and after opportunity for a hearing,
approve or disapprove the sourcing area being reviewed'' by adding to the end of the sentence the words ``pursuant
to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas

.). No extraordinary circumstances have been identified that might cause this proposed action to have a significant
effect on the human environment. Therefore, this rulemaking is categorically excluded from documentation in an
Environmental Impact Statement or an Environmental Assessment (40 CFR 1508.4; Forest Service Handbook 1909.15,
Environmental Policy and Procedures, &sect;31.1b(2), 57 FR 43208, September 18, 1992).

This rule relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, notice and opportunity for
comment are not required, and this rule may be made effective less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Further, since this rule relates to internal agency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order
12866. Finally, this action is not a rule as defined in Public Law No. 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
and thus is exempt from the provisions of that Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12630 and
it has been determined that the rule does not pose the risk of a taking of constitutionally protected private property.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under this rule: (1) All state and local
laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule or which could impede its full implementation will be preempted;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No administrative proceedings are required before parties may file suit in court challenging its provisions.

Procedure on examinations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The deponent shall be subject to cross-examination. Objections to questions or documents shall be in short form,
stating the grounds of objections relied upon. The questions propounded, together with all objections made (but
not including argument or debate), shall be recorded verbatim. In lieu of oral examination, parties may transmit

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicant shall arrange for the examination of the witness either by oral examination, or by written questions
upon agreement of the parties or as directed by the Judge. If the examination is conducted by means of written questions,
copies of the questions shall be served upon the other party to the proceeding and filed with the officer and the other
party may serve cross questions and file them with the officer at any time prior to the time of the examination.

party), in an envelope and mail the same by registered or certified mail to the Hearing Clerk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Corrections to the transcript. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) At any time prior to the hearing any party may file a motion proposing corrections to the transcript of the deposition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Unless a party files such a motion in the manner prescribed, the transcript shall be presumed, except for obvious
typographical errors, to be a true, correct, and complete transcript of the testimony given in the deposition proceeding
and to contain an accurate description or reference to all exhibits in connection therewith, and shall be deemed to
be certified correct without further procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) At any time prior to use of the deposition in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section and after consideration
of any objections filed thereto, the Judge may issue an order making any corrections in the transcript which the Judge
finds are warranted, which corrections shall be entered onto the original transcript by the Hearing Clerk (without
obscuring the original text).

rules if the Judge finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and that the witness is dead; that the witness is
unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or that such exceptional circumstances
exist as to make it desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the deposition to be used. If the party upon whose
motion the deposition was taken refuses to offer it in evidence, any other party may offer the deposition or any thereof
in evidence. If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction
of any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced and any party may introduce any other
parts.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is revising Regulation O to permit the aggregate limit on lending to insiders by eligible, adequately capitalized
small banks to be increased from 100 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus to 200. The Board also is revising Regulation
O to permit banks to follow alternative recordkeeping procedures on loans to insiders of affiliates, to narrow the
definition of ``extension of credit,'' and to adopt certain exceptions to the general restrictions on lending to
insiders and the special restrictions on lending to executive officers. Other minor revisions clarifying certain
exemptions and conforming certain provisions to the enabling statutes are included as well.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is making permanent, with certain additional qualifications, its interim rule permitting small, adequately
capitalized banks to extend credit to insiders up to 200 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus, in circumstances
where such lending is necessary to serve local credit needs or to attract directors. The Board also is adopting amendments
to Regulation O (12 CFR part 215) designed to increase the ability of banks to make extensions of credit that pose minimal
risk of loss, to eliminate recordkeeping requirements that impose a paperwork burden but do not significantly aid
compliance with the regulation, and to remove certain transactions from the regulation's coverage consistent with
bank safety and soundness. The above amendments are expected to increase the availability of credit, particularly
in communities served by small banks, and to reduce the cost of compliance with the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the extensive changes made to Regulation O as a result of this rulemaking, the Board is restating subpart
A of Regulation O as amended, rather than separately describing each amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is making the rule effective immediately in order to prevent a lapse in the 200 percent lending limit available
to eligible banks under the interim rule for loans to insiders, and to make all other provisions effective at the same
time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. The 200 Percent Aggregate Lending Limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 375b) restricts the amounts and terms of extensions of credit from
a bank to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders of the bank and its holding company affiliates
and to any related interest of those persons (insiders). Section 306 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 amended section 22(h) to impose an aggregate limit on the amount a bank may lend to its insiders as a class. See 12 U.S.C.
375b(5). In general, the limit is equal to 100 percent of the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. The
Board is authorized, however, to make exceptions to the general limit for banks with deposits of less than $100 million
``if the Board determines that the exceptions are important to avoid constricting the availability of credit in small
communities or to attract directors of such banks.'' 12 U.S.C. 375b(5)(C). The higher limit may not exceed 200 percent
of the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.

Effective May 18, 1992, the Board amended Regulation O, which implements section 22(h), to incorporate the aggregate
lending limit added by FDICIA. The general limit on lending to insiders and their related interests_100 percent of
the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus_was adopted. The Board also decided as an interim measure to
permit banks with deposits under $100 million to adopt a higher limit, not to exceed 200 percent of the bank's unimpaired
capital and unimpaired surplus, for a period of one year to expire May 18, 1993. The interim period was intended to allow
the Board to consult with the other federal banking agencies and collect data on the lending practices of banks in order
to analyze the effect of the aggregate lending limit on the availability of credit and service of directors. See 57
FR 22417, 22420, May 28, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board subsequently extended the interim rule for six months, through November 18, 1993, in order to obtain public
comments on whether the interim rule should be made permanent, modified, or permitted to expire. See 58 FR 28492, May
14, 1993. The Board thereafter extended the interim rule an additional three months, through February 18, 1994, in
order to review the written comments, call reports of small banks, and relevant information from other governmental
agencies. See 58 FR 61803, November 23, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim rule established requirements that a small bank had to meet in order to adopt a higher aggregate lending
limit. Under that rule, the board of directors of the bank had to determine by resolution that a higher aggregate lending
limit was consistent with prudent, safe, and sound banking practices in light of the bank's experience in lending
to its insiders, and that a higher limit was necessary to attract or retain directors or to prevent restricting the
availability of credit in small communities. The resolution had to set forth the facts and reasoning that supported
this determination, including the amount of the bank's aggregate lending to insiders, expressed as a percentage
of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, as of the date of the resolution. The bank also was required to submit
its resolution to the appropriate federal banking agency, with a copy to the Board. Finally, the bank had to meet or
exceed all applicable capital requirements. See 12 CFR 215.4(d)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the notice of the extension of the interim rule, the Board received 147 written comments, with 144 respondents
in favor of making the 200 percent limit permanent. Small banks subject to the rule submitted the large majority of
comments. Other commenters included numerous state and national banking trade associations, several state banking
superintendents and Federal Reserve Banks, individual bank directors, bank holding companies, and law firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adverse comment focused on the relatively low level of use of the interim provision. Two of the three adverse commenters
argued that a higher aggregate lending limit was not important to credit or director availability because very few
banks had used the interim rule. One state banking commissioner noted that of the 88 small banks it supervised, only
one had aggregate insider loans in excess of 60 percent of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus as of March 31,
1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Call report data reflected a similar low level of aggregate insider lending. As of September 30, 1993, of a total population
of 7,435 banks with deposits of less than $100 million, only 17 reported loans to insiders in an amount greater than
100 percent of capital. A total of 131 banks reported insider loans greater than 60 percent of capital. Only 54 banks
have notified the Board pursuant to the interim rule that they have adopted a higher aggregate lending limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In support of the proposed rule, sixty-two commenters stated that a higher aggregate lending limit was important
in order that small banks not be forced to choose between refusing credit to qualified insiders and asking insiders
to resign as directors. Several banks observed that this was a particular hardship because qualified directors typically
are active businesspersons whose businesses have substantial yet healthy credit requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifteen commenters observed that the aggregate lending limit was a particular hardship in small communities and
rural markets because in those settings small banks were dependent on insiders as a loan source, insiders had fewer
alternative credit sources, and insiders tended to be closely identified with their banks, making it difficult for
them to seek credit from a competitor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to demonstrate that the higher limit was being used and would have important benefits if made permanent, the
Independent Bankers Association of America (IBAA) presented in its comment a survey of 8,057 small banks. Of 1,060
banks that responded to the survey, 152 reported that the general aggregate lending limit had prevented them from
making a loan to an insider; 95 respondents reported that the aggregate lending limit had prevented them from naming
an individual as a director; and 53 respondents reported that they had accepted a director resignation attributable
to the aggregate lending limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional commenters presented a variety of reasons for the low level of use of the interim 200 percent limit: concern
that the interim rule would be eliminated, thereby forcing banks to retract credit extended in reliance on it; historically
low lending levels; loan participations as an alternative to approving a higher limit; and deferral of consideration
of the issue by small banks whose insider loans had not matured since adoption of the interim rule. Some commenters
also observed that the interim rule imposed detailed requirements and that some banks may have feared attracting
additional regulatory scrutiny by adopting the interim rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the close of the comment period, the General Accounting Office (GAO) provided to the Board a draft report on bank
insider activities. The GAO reviewed banks that failed during 1990 and 1991 in order to determine whether insider
practices contributed to the banks' failures. (The GAO did not evaluate any existing or proposed regulation in this
area.) The GAO found that insider problems (which the GAO defined very broadly) were prevalent at failed banks, that
banks with less than $100 million of assets were more likely than larger banks to be cited for insider problems, and
that the most frequently cited violations were loans to insiders made in excess of lending limits and on preferential
terms not available to the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the GAO report did not establish a causal link between insider problems and bank failures. Rather, the GAO
appeared to conclude that insider problems, as broadly defined by the GAO, were correlated with poor internal controls
and underwriting practices. The GAO was not able to measure the actual level of insider lending at failed or troubled
banks, and therefore was not able to address specifically the relationship of the actual level of insider lending
to bank failures. The major GAO recommendations were for increased monitoring of insider lending and more effective
follow-up on violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has concluded that the concerns raised in the GAO report do not justify preventing qualified banks from utilizing
a higher aggregate lending limit. If the higher limit should present safety and soundness problems at an institution,
then the appropriate banking supervisor retains general authority to require a reduction in the level of insider
loans. If problems should occur more generally, the Board retains authority to eliminate or reduce the exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the 100 percent aggregate lending limit does not appear to be currently creating a widespread problem with
credit or director availability, the Board has concluded that it does appear to pose important problems for banks
in certain communities. Given the available data and the comments, the Board believes that the 100 percent limit is
restricting the availability of credit and the recruitment of directors in communities where the proper certification
can be made. In such circumstances, the Board believes that an eligible small bank should be permitted to establish
a higher lending limit up to 200 percent of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Each eligible bank's board
of directors will still be required to certify that the higher limit is necessary to avoid restricting credit or to
assist in attracting directors and is consistent with prudent, safe, and sound banking practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board emphasizes that, as was the case prior to FDICIA, borrowing by insiders will continue to be subject to scrutiny
during the examination process, including an evaluation of whether such borrowing represents an inappropriate
concentration of loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, the Board has adopted three modifications to the proposed rule. First, the Board has provided that
to qualify for the higher lending limit, a bank must be in satisfactory overall condition as determined in the most
recent report of examination of the bank, as well as being adequately capitalized, as was already required in the interim
rule. Second, a provision has been added clarifying that a bank operating above the 100 percent limit that subsequently
becomes ineligible for the higher limit may retain its existing insider loans but may not extend credit that would
maintain aggregate insider lending in excess of 100 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus. Third, banks are not
be required to file the required resolutions with their primary regulator or the Board, as was required by the interim
rule. The resolutions are to be made available for inspection during the examination process.

III. Recordkeeping Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 215.8 of Regulation O currently requires that each bank maintain records necessary for compliance with the
insider lending restrictions of Regulation O. Specifically, banks are required to maintain records (1) identifying
all directors, officers, and principal shareholders of the bank and its affiliates and all related interests of those
persons (collectively, ``insiders''), and (2) specifying the amounts and terms of all credit extended to these insiders.
Section 215.8 further requires each bank to request on an annual basis that its insiders and insiders of its affiliates
identify their related interests. The list of insiders is then used by the bank to identify all existing or proposed
extensions of credit covered by Regulation O, to monitor the amount thereof subject to the individual and aggregate
lending limits, and to ensure that all appropriate approval procedures are followed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since adoption of the initial recordkeeping requirement, the annual survey has grown in size and complexity. Bank
holding companies have become increasingly large and diversified, and commercial organizations have acquired
credit card banks and limited purpose banks. Thus, for example, a small, grandfathered bank owned by a large diversified
holding company may have hundreds of affiliates with thousands of officers and directors. Although the bank may have
no contact with these officers and directors and companies controlled by them, it currently is required to collect
information on all these parties. In another example, a CEBA credit card bank is prevented by law from making loans
to anyone but individuals,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and is thus effectively prohibited from lending to insiders' related interests, but the current rule nonetheless
requires the bank to conduct an annual survey of related interests.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 9, 1993, the Board published notice of proposed rulemaking and requested comment concerning alternative
recordkeeping procedures that banks may follow to monitor loans to insiders of the bank and its affiliates. See 58
FR 47400. The Board proposed to allow each bank to decide on its own how to gather information on related interests,
so long as its method was effective. For example, in the case of a nonbank credit card bank or other bank that does not
make commercial loans, the bank could decide not to keep records on related interests. For banks that make commercial
loans, two acceptable recordkeeping methods were identified: (1) The ``survey'' method currently required, under
which all insiders are asked annually to identify all their related interests; and (2) the ``borrower inquiry'' method,
under which the bank would (a) ask each commercial borrower as part of the loan application process whether it is a related
interest of an insider of the bank, and (b) maintain a record of each affirmative response. Finally, the proposed rule
sought comment on whether any other recordkeeping methods would be effective in monitoring compliance with Regulation
O. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft GAO report, discussed above, urged the federal bank agencies to emphasize the importance of accurate and
complete insider recordkeeping. Management recordkeeping failures, the GAO argued, were indicative of larger
bank management problems, and management solutions in this area, the GAO reasoned, would contribute to the resolution
of management's larger problems. The Board believes that the proposed recordkeeping amendments, which attempt
to eliminate unnecessary recordkeeping and allow for alternative methods of recordkeeping, are consistent with
the GAO's recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters supported the recordkeeping amendments as a means of decreasing unnecessary paperwork burden. Commenters
uniformly supported no longer requiring credit card banks and other institutions that do not make commercial loans
to keep records on the related interests of insiders. No commenter proposed any general recordkeeping methods in
addition to those identified in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters expressed concerns about the second recordkeeping option put forth in the proposed rule_the ``borrower
inquiry'' method. Commenters noted that in some cases a corporate borrower might be unaware that it is a related interest
of a bank insider and therefore might inadvertently misinform a bank's loan officer. For example, a corporate employee
negotiating a loan may not know that one of his company's controlling shareholders is also a director of one of the lending
bank's affiliates. Citing this possibility, several bank commenters supported the recordkeeping provision but
requested that the Board specify that use of the borrower inquiry method would give a bank a ``safe harbor'' from criticism
during an examination in the event that inaccurate certifications were accepted from borrowers. On a related point,
two commenters sought assurance that internal controls consistent with the proposed recordkeeping alternatives
would meet the compliance certification requirements of section 112 of FDICIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes protections currently exist to prevent intentional misreporting by borrowers under the borrower
inquiry method. Intentional misreporting could bring criminal or civil penalties. First, a borrower that knowingly
misstates whether it is a related interest of the lending bank is criminally liable. 18 U.S.C. 1014. Second, a bank
insider to whom the corporate borrower is related and who is aware of the loan violates Regulation O if the insider permits
the related interest to receive any extension of credit not authorized under Regulation O. 12 CFR 215.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has also concluded that any unintentional misreporting should not be a matter of serious concern. While
there could be cases in large multi-bank holding companies where a borrower and lender are genuinely ignorant of the
relationship between them, there is no potential in those circumstances for an insider's status to improperly affect
the credit decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has decided to adopt the recordkeeping provisions, as proposed, with three amendments. First, in order
to address concerns about inaccurate reporting, the Board has adopted an additional safeguard to prevent the occurrence
of those reporting errors, both intentional and unintentional, that are likely to occur most frequently and that
raise the greatest concern. The final rule establishes a minimum requirement that every bank, regardless of the recordkeeping
method it selects, must conduct an annual survey to identify its own insiders (that is, its own executive officers,
directors, and principal shareholders and their related interests, but not those of its holding company affiliates).
Every bank is expected to check this short list before extending credit, even if it is employing the borrower inquiry
method of recordkeeping for affiliates in lieu of the survey method. In addition to addressing possible violations
of Regulation O, the limited survey and the short list it produces will be available for monitoring compliance with
section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As for concerns about a ``safe harbor,'' the Board believes that an implicit safe harbor exists for banks electing
either one of the two recordkeeping options included in the final rule, and that following either of these options
would allow the necessary certification to be made for purposes of section 112 of FDICIA. Furthermore, under the enforcement
guidelines, the federal banking agencies should not assess civil money penalties for an inadvertent or accidental
violation of their rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, because the commenters did not identify any recordkeeping methods other than the two proposed by the Board,
the Board has adopted a presumption in the final rule that a bank must use either one of the two identified methods unless
it can demonstrate that another method is equally effective. The suitability of any alternative procedure for monitoring
lending to insiders and their related interests must be determined, of course, on the basis of the effectiveness of
the procedure in preventing violations of law and insider abuse. Any alternative recordkeeping procedure must sufficiently
identify extensions of credit covered by Regulation O to ensure that proper monitoring of and compliance with insider
lending restrictions is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Board has made an explicit exemption from the requirement that a bank keep records of, or inquire about
related interests of insiders of the bank or its affiliates, for banks that are prohibited from making commercial
loans in the first place.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Related interests consist only of companies or other similar entities, as a result of which a bank that is prohibited
from making commercial loans is prohibited from making loans to any company or other entity that may be a related interest.
When such a prohibition exists, recordkeeping or inquiries with respect to related interests is unnecessarily burdensome.

IV. Definition of Extension of Credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposed three amendments to the definition of ``extension of credit'' in Regulation O: a clarification
of the ``tangible economic benefit'' rule; a new exception for the discount by a bank of obligations sold by an insider
without recourse; and an increase in the threshold for treating credit card debt as an extension of credit. See 58 FR
47400, September 9, 1993.

A. ``Tangible Economic Benefit'' Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulation O provides that an extension of credit is deemed to be made to an insider when the proceeds of the credit are
used for the tangible economic benefit of, or are transferred to, the insider. 12 CFR 215.3(f). These extensions of
credit are thereby counted toward the lending limits of Regulation O.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following the enactment of FDICIA, which expanded the lending limit provision of section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve
Act to cover directors and their related interests, questions were raised more frequently regarding the scope and
proper application of the tangible economic benefit rule. If interpreted literally, the tangible economic benefit
rule would apply whenever a bank extended credit to any person, including a member of the general public with no other
relationship to the bank, and the proceeds of the extension of credit were transferred to or used for the benefit of
an insider or an insider's related interest. For example, as one commenter noted, loans on non-preferential terms
to members of the general public to purchase homes from a builder who is a director of the bank would be treated as loans
to the builder/director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tangible economic benefit rule is similar to a provision contained in section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, and
was adopted at a time when the Board was required by section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act to use the definition of
``extension of credit'' found in section 23A. See Public Law 95&hyph;630 Section 104, 92 Stat. 3644 (1978). The definition
of extension of credit in section 22(h), however, is no longer tied to section 23A, and the Board is authorized to adopt
appropriate definitions of terms in the statute. See 12 U.S.C. 375b(9)(D) and 375b(10). The Board therefore proposed
to revise the tangible economic benefit rule to clarify that it was not intended to reach such transactions, by providing
explicitly that the rule does not apply to an arm's-length
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 extension of credit by a bank to a third party where the proceeds of the credit are used to finance the bona fide acquisition
of property, goods, or services from an insider or an insider's related interest.

4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to satisfy this requirement, the extension of credit to the general public must be on terms that would satisfy
the standard set forth in &sect;215.4 of Regulation O if the extension of credit was being made directly to an insider
or an insider's related interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters supported the proposal, and no adverse comments were received. Three commenters objected to the requirement
that any arm's-length loan satisfy the non-preferential provisions for insider loans found in &sect;215.4(a),
labelling that requirement overly restrictive. The Board has retained the requirement, however, that loans be on
non-preferential terms, in order to prevent banks from participating in commercial promotions that benefit the
bank's insiders to the detriment of the bank.

 One other commenter sought clarification on the relationship between the tangible economic benefit rule and another
rule in Regulation O that states that loans made by a bank to a partnership in which one or more executive officers of
the bank hold a majority interest are to be attributed in full to each of the executive officers. 12 CFR 215.5(b). The
introductory portion of &sect;215.5 has been revised to clarify the interplay between &sect;215.5 and the general
provisions of Regulation O. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continuing to be covered by the tangible economic benefit rule are extensions of credit to an insider's nominee and
transactions in which the proceeds of the credit are loaned to an insider. The Board also notes that provisions of the
definition of ``extension of credit'' outside the tangible economic benefit rule will continue to reach transactions
in which an insider actually becomes obligated to a bank, ``whether the obligation arises directly or indirectly,
or because of an endorsement on an obligation or otherwise, or by any means whatsoever.'' 12 CFR 215.3(a)(8).

B. Discount of Obligations without Recourse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulation O includes within the definition of ``extension of credit'' any ``discount of promissory notes, bills
of exchange, conditional sales contracts, or similar paper, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
whether with or without recourse
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' 12 CFR 215.3(a)(5) (emphasis added). At the time this provision was adopted, the Board was required by section
22(h) to include such items in the regulatory definition of extension of credit.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, the current statutory definition does not require the inclusion of such items where the transaction is made
without recourse to the transferor.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board proposed to delete this provision so as to exclude non-recourse transactions from Regulation O coverage.
Transactions entered into with recourse to the transferor would continue to be covered under other provisions of
the definition. See 12 CFR 215.3(a)(4) and (8).

The current definition of ``extension of credit'' in Regulation O was adopted in 1979, when the Board substantially
amended the regulation in order to implement the Financial Institutions Regulatory Act of 1978 (FIRA), Public Law
95&hyph;630 Section 104, 92 Stat. 3644 (1978). 44 FR 12963, March 9, 1979. FIRA added section 22(h) to the Act, which
in turn incorporated the definition of ``extension of credit'' contained in section 23A. At that time, section 23A's
definition included the above-referenced provision concerning the discount of paper acquired with or without recourse.
See Public Law 89&hyph;485 Section 12, 80 Stat. 241 (1966).

The statutory cross-reference to section 23A was deleted from section 22(h) in 1982. See Public Law 97&hyph;230 Section
410, 96 Stat. 1520 (1982). FDICIA added a new definition of ``extension of credit'' to section 22(h), which applies
whenever a member bank makes or renews a loan, grants a line of credit, or enters into any similar transaction as a result
of which a person becomes obligated to pay money or its equivalent to the bank. See 12 U.S.C. 375b(9)(D). This definition
does not cover all transactions, such as the purchase of assets, covered by section 23A.

The Board has adopted this amendment as proposed. Non-recourse transactions resemble a purchase of assets more than
the lending of money, and the final rule conforms the treatment of these transactions to the treatment of other asset
pruchases between a bank and its insiders. Moreover, these non-recourse transactions do not constitute ``extensions
of credit'' to the transferor under the National Bank Act as interpreted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
See 12 U.S.C. 84(b)(1); 12 CFR 32.2(a). These transactions will continue to be governed, however, by general standards
of safety and soundness, prohibitions against fraud and abuse, and corporate fiduciary duties.

whether limited or partial recourse transactions would be treated as extensions of credit. The Board believes that
it is more appropriate to address the numerous possible recourse arrangements on a case-by-case basis.

C. Credit Card Plan Indebtedness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulation O exempts from the definition of ``extension of credit,'' and thus from Regulation O's lending limits,
indebtedness of $5,000 or less arising through any general arrangement by which a bank: (1) Acquires charge or time
credit accounts; or (2) makes payments to or on behalf of participants in a bank credit card plan or other open-end credit
plan. 12 CFR 215.3(b)(5). To qualify for the exemption, the indebtedness must be on market terms and must not involve
prior individual clearance or approval by the bank other than for the purpose of determining the borrower's eligibility
and compliance with any applicable dollar limit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposed to increase from $5,000 to $15,000 the threshold above which standard credit card loans to insiders
would be counted as extensions of credit. This proposed increase reflected widespread increases by credit card issuers
in pre-approved lending limits and, to some extent, inflation since the initial adoption of the $5,000 limit in 1979.
The Board did not propose raising the limit for extensions of credit through overdraft plans, leaving that limit at
$5,000. Extensions of credit through overdrafts in amounts up to $15,000 have not become routine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters supported the proposed increase. Many commenters, however, requested that the increase be expanded.
Thirteen commenters suggested that the proposed $15,000 cap on the amount of excluded credit card debt either be eliminated,
increased, indexed, or periodically reviewed. Two commenters requested that credit card debt be exempted from the
cap on general purpose loans to executive officers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight commenters requested that the overdraft limit be raised by an identical amount. Commenters reasoned that one
extension of credit is the same as another and thus that no substantive difference exists between credit card loans
and overdraft extensions of credit. Moreover, some overdraft protection plans are now tied directly to credit card
lines of credit. Commenters also noted that the rationale that the credit card limit was being raised to compensate
for inflation applied equally to overdraft protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has decided to increase the credit card exemption from $5,000 to $15,000 and to maintain the overdraft limit
at $5,000. Raising the limit could encourage insiders to view overdraft plans as a source of credit, rather than solely
as protection against infrequent and unplanned events. The Board is not prohibiting payment of overdrafts over $5,000
pursuant to a permissible pre-approved overdraft plan, but merely providing that overdrafts over $5,000 are counted
toward the individual and aggregate lending limits of Regulation O. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that the proposed limit is an appropriate compromise between its concern to prevent insider lending
abuse and the added convenience that even higher or indexed limits may provide. Commenters presented no evidence
to support their argument that a cap on exempt credit card lending is no longer necessary. Finally, the Board believes
that exempting credit card loans from the cap on general purpose loans to executive officers would be more properly
addressed in the context of a more general review of executive officer lending restrictions.

 the Board proposed an exception to the aggregate lending limit for the discount of consumer installment paper from
an insider with recourse, so long as the bank is relying primarily upon the creditworthiness of the maker of the paper
and not on any endorsement or guarantee of the insider. Such transactions would continue to constitute extensions
of credit subject to the aggregate lending limit if the maker of the consumer installment paper was an insider. See

 The proposed exception is consistent with this directive. The Board has concluded that, where the bank is relying

Commenters generally supported the new exception, and no adverse comments were received. Three commenters argued
that the proposed requirement that a designated officer of the bank certify in writing that the bank is relying primarily
upon the maker of the discounted paper was too burdensome because it did not accommodate itself to bulk transactions
in which the bank may perform only a statistical sampling of a discounted loan portfolio. One commenter asked the Board
to clarify that the discount of consumer lease paper was included in the provision. Six commenters suggested adoption
of additional exceptions contained in the National Bank Act, and one commenter suggested an additional exception
not included in the National Bank Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement that a designated officer certify that the bank has followed appropriate underwriting procedures
is found in the National Bank Act, and the Board has decided to maintain consistency with that Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning consumer lease paper, the Board notes that an interpretative letter concerning the circumstances under
which a lease transaction may be considered to be an extension of credit for purposes of Regulation O has previously
been issued. See Interpretative Letter dated April 8, 1976. The Board believes that it would be more appropriate to
provide further guidance as to the treatment of particular transactions under Regulation O on a case-by-case basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional exemptions found in the National Bank Act have not been adopted. Those are either limited exemptions,
exemptions for credit secured by collateral that is not stable and liquid, or exemptions that would be difficult to
administer in the Regulation O context. Other exemptions suggested by commenters would require statutory change.

The Board proposed three amendments to the rules governing extensions of credit by a bank to its executive officers:
A new exemption to the limit for general purpose loans that are fully collateralized by certain categories of highly
stable and liquid collateral; clarification that home mortgage loan refinancing, subject to certain limitations,
is included in the category of home mortgage loans; and a restatement of the prior approval requirement in section
22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act. See 58 FR 47400, September 9, 1993.

A. General Purpose Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act establishes a special additional rule for extensions of credit by a bank to
its executive officers. In general, a bank's lending to each of its executive officers is limited to an amount equal
to the greater of $25,000 or 2.5 percent of the bank's capital and unimpaired surplus, but not to exceed $100,000. 12
CFR 215.5(c). Qualifying home mortgage loans and educational loans are not counted toward this limit, although they
do count toward the general individual and aggregate lending limits applicable to all insiders under &sect;215.4
of Regulation O. 12 CFR 215.5(c)(1) and (2). Also, unlike the general individual and aggregate lending limits, there
has been no exception to the executive officer lending limit based on the manner in which the extension of credit is
collateralized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposed to create an exemption to the general purpose lending limit for loans to executive officers for
loans fully secured by: (a) Obligations of the United States or other obligations fully guaranteed as to principal
and interest by the United States; (b) commitments or guarantees of a department or agency of the United States; or
(c) a segregated deposit account with the lending bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board previously has determined that extensions of credit collateralized in the manner described above pose
minimal risk of loss to a bank. See 58 FR 26507, May 4, 1993. In view of this determination, the Board has concluded that
it is consistent with safe and sound banking practices to increase the amount of credit that a bank may extend to its
executive officers when the credit is secured as described above. Because such loans would continue to be subject
to the prohibitions against preferential lending, the Board also believes that the proposed exception would not
lend itself to evasions of the law or any other abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters supported the proposed exception. Six commenters suggested that additional categories of exempt extensions
of credit be adopted. Nine commenters requested that the current $100,000 cap on general purpose loans be increased,
and two commenters suggested that the cap be eliminated altogether. One commenter suggested that loans to an executive
officer serving in a bona fide fiduciary capacity not be included as loans to the executive officer for purposes of
12 CFR 215.5(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional exceptions that have been proposed apply more readily to loans made in a commercial context rather
than to personal loans. Section 215.5 primarily governs personal loans, however, and the additional proposals therefore
are neither necessary nor appropriate. The Board also considers it more appropriate to reconsider the appropriate
lending limit for executive officers in connection with a more general review of executive officer restrictions.
Finally, the Board notes that the proper treatment under Regulation O of loans to an executive officer serving in a
bona fide fiduciary capacity has previously been addressed. See I Fed. Res. Reg. Serv. 3&hyph;1048. The Board will
provide any further guidance on this issue on a case-by-case basis.

B. Refinancing of Home Mortgage Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act provides that a bank may make a loan to its executive officer, without restriction
as to amount, if the loan is secured by a first lien on a dwelling that is owned by the executive officer and used by the
executive officer as a residence after the loan is made. 12 U.S.C. 375a(2). Section 215.5(c)(2) of Regulation O implements
this provision, and sets forth additional restrictions on such loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposed to revise the regulation to provide clearly that the refinancing of a home mortgage loan is included
within this category to the extent that the proceeds are used to pay off the prior home mortgage loan or for one or more
of the permissible purposes enumerated in 12 CFR 215.5(c)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were generally supportive. Two commenters asked the Board to clarify that the closing costs of a home mortgage
refinancing are included as part of the qualifying portion of the loan. Two commenters requested that all proceeds
of a home mortgage refinancing be included in this category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board, as requested in the comments, has revised the regulation further to provide expressly that closing costs
are included as part of the exempt portion of a home mortgage refinancing, and to make other clarifying changes. Inclusion
within the exemption of proceeds of a refinancing that may be used for unrestricted purposes is prohibited by the enabling
statute.

C. Prior Approval of Home Mortgage Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 22(g) provides that the board of directors of a bank must specifically approve in advance a home mortgage loan
to an executive officer. 12 U.S.C. 375a(2). Regulation O, however, does not set forth this requirement. The Board
proposed that 12 CFR 215.5(c) be revised to conform to the enabling statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments upon this proposal were mixed. One commenter asked the Board to clarify that prior approval is required for
all home mortgage loans regardless of size, notwithstanding the general provisions of Regulation O that require
prior approval only for loans in excess of a calculated amount. See 12 CFR 215.4(b). Two commenters suggested that
the Board rely on its rulemaking authority not to conform to the statute, and two commenters asked the Board to seek
relief from this requirement from Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has adopted this provision substantially as proposed. As discussed above, the Board has added an introductory
statement to &sect;215.5 to clarify that the requirements for extensions of credit to executive officers under that
section, pursuant to section 22(g), are in addition to the general requirements for insiders set forth elsewhere
in Regulation O. The Board lacks the authority to adopt a provision of Regulation O that does not conform to the statutory
prior approval requirement. The additional comments are beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

the regulation read more clearly and allows various cross-references and footnotes to be eliminated. Because the
technical amendments do not make any substantive change to the regulation, notice and comment on them was not required.

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3507, and 5 CFR 1320.130, the Board, under authority
delegated by the Office of Management and Budget, has reviewed its amendments to Regulation O. The Board has determined
that the revisions do not significantly increase the burden of the reporting institutions. The changes are expected
to reduce regulatory burden for some banks, particularly small community banks and rural banks, but the estimated
effect on aggregate burden calculations is not deemed to be significant.

 A member bank may not extend credit to any insider of the bank or insider of its affiliates unless the extension of credit

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

in light of the bank's experience in lending to its insiders and is necessary to attract or retain directors or to prevent
restricting the availability of credit in small communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The resolution sets forth the facts and reasoning on which the board of directors bases the finding, including

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following restrictions on extensions of credit by a member bank to any of its executive officers apply in addition
to any restrictions on extensions of credit by a member bank to insiders of itself or its affiliates set forth elsewhere

(b) No member bank may extend credit in an aggregate amount greater than the amount permitted in paragraph (c)(3) of
this section to a partnership in which one or more of the bank's executive officers are partners and, either individually
or together, hold a majority interest. For the purposes of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the total amount of credit
extended by a member bank to such partnership is considered to be extended to each executive officer of the member bank
who is a member of the partnership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A member bank is authorized to extend credit to any executive officer of the bank: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) With the specific prior approval of the board of directors, in any amount to finance or refinance the purchase,
construction, maintenance, or improvement of a residence of the executive officer, provided: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The extension of credit is secured by a first lien on the residence and the residence is owned (or expected to be owned
after the extension of credit) by the executive officer; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of a refinancing, that only the amount thereof used to repay the original extension of credit, together
with the closing costs of the refinancing, and any additional amount thereof used for any of the purposes enumerated
in this paragraph (c)(2), are included within this category of credit; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In any amount, if the extension of credit is secured in a manner described in &sect;215.4(d)(3)(i)(A) through
(d)(3)(i)(C) of this part; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For any other purpose not specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, if the aggregate amount
of extensions of credit to that executive officer under this paragraph does not exceed at any one time the higher of
2.5 per cent of the bank's capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000, but in no event more than $100,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any extension of credit by a member bank to any of its executive officers shall be: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Promptly reported to the member bank's board of directors;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Made subject to the condition in writing that the extension of credit will, at the option of the member bank, become
due and payable at any time that the officer is indebted to any other bank or banks in an aggregate amount greater than
the amount specified for a category of credit in paragraph (c) of this section.

(a) Any extension of credit that was outstanding on March 10, 1979, and that would, if made on or after March 10, 1979,
violate &sect;215.4(c) of this part, shall be reduced in amount by March 10, 1980, to be in compliance with the lending
limit in &sect;215.4(c) of this part. Any renewal or extension of such an extension of credit on or after March 10, 1979,
shall be made only on terms that will bring the extension of credit into compliance with the lending limit of &sect;215.4(c)
of this part by March 10, 1980. However, any extension of credit made before March 10, 1979, that bears a specific maturity
date of March 10, 1980, or later, shall be repaid in accordance with its repayment schedule in existence on or before
March 10, 1979. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If a member bank is unable to bring all extensions of credit outstanding on March 10, 1979, into compliance as required
by paragraph (a) of this section, the member bank shall promptly report that fact to the Comptroller of the Currency,
in the case of a national bank, or to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank, in the case of a State member bank, and explain
the reasons why all the extensions of credit cannot be brought into compliance. The Comptroller or the Reserve Bank,
as the case may be, is authorized, on the basis of good cause shown, to extend the March 10, 1980, date for compliance
for any extension of credit for not more than two additional one-year periods.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is hereby adopting an interim rule which defines ``predominantly minority
neighborhood'' as used in section 21A(s) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (FHLBA) and section 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA,
as amended by the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act. Section 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA requires, among other
things, that in considering offers to acquire any insured depository institution, or any branch of an insured depository
institution, located in a predominantly minority neighborhood (as defined in regulations prescribed under section
21A(s) of the FHLBA), the Corporation shall give preference to an offer from any minority individual, minority-owned
business, or a minority depository institution, over any other offer that results in the same cost to the Corporation,
as determined under section 13(c)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Section 21A(s) of the FHLBA permits the
RTC to lease to a minority acquiror, on a rent-free basis, subject to certain conditions, any branch of a failed institution
which is located in a ``predominantly minority neighborhood.'' Section 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA also generally provides
that the RTC may provide to such minority individual, minority-owned business, or minority depository institution
additional preferences in the form of capital assistance and performing assets. The interim rule generally defines
``predominantly minority neighborhood'' as any U.S. Postal Zip Code geographical area in which 50% or more of the
persons residing therein are minorities based upon the most recent Census data, unless the RTC has determined, in
its sole discretion, that other reasonably reliable, readily accessible data indicates different neighborhood
boundaries. The RTC is also seeking comment on the interim rule.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In August 1989, Congress enacted section 501 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act
of 1989, (FIRREA), (codified as section 21A(b) of the FHLBA, 12 U.S.C. 1441a(b)), which established the Resolution
Trust Corporation (RTC). Pursuant to FIRREA the RTC has the duty to manage and resolve failed depository institutions
that come under its jurisdiction and to conduct the operations of the RTC in a manner which ``maximizes the *&blank;*&blank;*
return from the sale of institutions or assets,'' ``makes efficient use of funds'' and ``minimizes *&blank;*&blank;*
losses *&blank;*&blank;* in the resolution of [failed institutions]''. Section 21A(b)(3) of the FHLBA, as added
by section 501(a) of FIRREA. In addition, the RTC is required to resolve all failed institutions in the ``least costly
*&blank;*&blank;* of all possible methods'' (collectively Cost Constraints). Section 13(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), 12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)(A)(ii), as made applicable by section 21A(b)(4) of the
FHLBA, 12 U.S.C. 1441a(b)(4). The RTC is committed, wherever practicable and whenever consistent with those statutory
Cost Constraints, to preserving the ownership characteristics of historically minority-owned depository institutions,
and to increasing the total number of minority-owned depository institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 21A(s) of the FHLBA permits the RTC to make available to an acquiror which is either a minority depository institution
or a women's depository institution, on a rent-free lease basis for not less than 5 years, any branch of a failed institution
which is located in a ``predominantly minority neighborhood.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA, which was added by section 3(a) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act,
Pub. L. 103&hyph;204 (the Act), provides that in considering offers to acquire any insured depository institution,
or any branch thereof, located in a ``predominantly minority neighborhood'', (as defined in regulations prescribed
under subsection (s)), the RTC shall give preference to an offer from a minority individual, minority-owned business,
or a minority depository institution (Minority Acquiror), over any other offer that results in the same cost to the
RTC as determined under section 13(c)(4)(A) of the FDIA.

This Act also provides, in connection with such an acquisition, the following additional preferences: (i) the Minority
Acquiror shall be eligible for minority interim capital assistance under section 21A(u)(1) of the FHLBA, provided
that such assistance is consistent with section 13(c)(4)(A) of the FDIA; (ii) the RTC may provide to the Minority Acquiror
performing assets under the RTC's control, in addition to those of the depository institution or branch to be acquired,
in an amount not greater than the amount of the net liabilities carried on the books of the depository institution or
branch and acquired by the Minority Acquiror; and (iii) such disposition of the performing assets of the failed depository
institution or branch to the Minority Acquiror shall have a first priority over a disposition by the RTC of such assets
for any other purpose.

This interim rule defines ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' as used in sections 21A(s) and 21A(w)(17) of
the FHLBA as a geographic area constituting a United States Postal Service 5-digit Zip Code (Zip Code) in which 50%
or more of the persons residing therein are minorities, based upon the most recent census data, unless the RTC determines,
in its sole discretion, that other reasonably reliable, readily accessible data indicates different neighborhood
boundaries. The population data and the minority composition of these Zip Codes are determined using the most recent
(currently 1990 data) Census of Population data (Census Data) collected and published by the U.S. Department of Commerce,
Economics and Statistics Administration, Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the institution or a branch thereof is located in a Zip Code area for which no significant Census Data is available
(e.g., a business district or office building) the Zip Code of a nearby geographic area served by the institution or
branch, for which such Census Data is available, will be used as its Zip Code for purposes of this rule. If the RTC determines,
in its sole discretion, based upon other reasonably reliable and readily accessible data, and subject to RTC's Cost
Constraints, that a different delineation would more accurately reflect the area served by the financial institution
or branch to be marketed, the RTC will use such delineation as the boundaries for the relevant neighborhood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no legislative history which might provide clear guidance in developing a definition of ``predominantly
minority neighborhood.'' Consequently, except for the word ``minority'' which is statutorily defined, the definition
of ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' was, therefore, developed based upon the common or ordinary meanings
of the individual words comprising the phrase, the statutory context in which they have been used, and based upon readily
available data.

One of the ordinary meanings of the word ``predominant'' is ``the most common.'' WEBSTER'S II NEW RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITY
DICTIONARY 927 (1988). Since in the context of this statutory framework a neighborhood can only be either a minority
neighborhood or a non-minority neighborhood, the most common or prevalent of two categories means a majority or more
than half. Moreover, consistent with the legislative purpose of preserving and promoting minority ownership and
service, in the case of any exact 50% split between the two categories, minorities should be viewed as predominant.
Therefore, if half or more of the residents of a neighborhood are minorities, that neighborhood is predominantly
minority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The word ``minority'' is defined by statute to have the meaning given such term in section 1204(c)(3) of FIRREA. Sections
21A(s) &amp; 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA. Section 1204(c)(3) of FIRREA defines ``minority'' to mean ``any Black American,
Native American, Hispanic American, or Asian American.'' This interim rule provides a definition of the word ``minority''
which incorporates the statutory definition but permits the use of equivalent classifications used by the Census
Bureau in collecting the Census Data. Among other categories, the Census Bureau collects and publishes population
Census Data by State, County, County subdivision, Place, Zip Code (available on CD-rom or tape) Census Tract or block
numbering area, Block group, and Block. Each census of the U.S. population provides data on the minority composition
of those areas in a manner which corresponds with the statutory definition of ``minority'' in FIRREA. The population
classifications utilized in the Census Data for the 1990 census are: Hispanic origin and the following racial categories:
White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut; Asian or Pacific Islander; and Other Race. Bureau of the Census,
Economics and Statistics Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1990 CENSUS OF POPULATION, GENERAL POPULATION
CHARACTERISTICS (1992). Since Census Data is readily available, its use to determine the minority composition of
a particular geographic area is not only reasonable and efficient, but also consistent with the RTC's statutory Cost
Constraints.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ordinary dictionary meaning of the word ``neighborhood'' is a district or area with distinctive characteristics.
WEBSTER'S II NEW RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITY DICTIONARY 789 (1988). Neighborhoods vary in size and can be contained within
each other. Since the only reasonably reliable population data which is readily available on a nationwide basis is
Census Data, it is both reasonable and cost-efficient to define ``neighborhood'' in terms of the geographic areas
utilized by the Census Bureau. Census Data, including minority composition, is available for specific geographic
areas, including among others, State, County, County subdivision, Place, Zip Code, Census Tract, Block and Block
group. Census Tracts and Zip Codes appear to be the only such categories which might approximate the size and characteristics
of a ``neighborhood'' served by an ``institution, or any branch'' thereof.

The RTC has found no indication that an extensive, customized survey and analysis of the demographics and other characteristics
of the geographic area surrounding each branch of a failed institution would yield results significantly different
from those obtained by using Census Data and Zip Codes or Census Tracts. In addition, reliable population data for
individually determined areas is not readily available on a consistent nationwide basis. The nature of the RTC's
statutory Cost Constraints in marketing and selling a failed depository institution dictates that the identification
of ``predominantly minority neighborhoods'' be accomplished with relative speed and minimal expense. The failed
institutions the RTC resolves suffer significant operating losses on a daily basis. An increase in those operating
losses due to a delay in the resolution of the institution caused by the implementation of a definition of ``predominately
minority neighborhood'' which is difficult and time consuming to utilize is clearly inconsistent with the RTC's
statutory duties.

The United States Postal Service has subdivided the United States and its territories into discrete geographic areas
for purposes of the distribution of mail, and has designated each such area with a 5-digit numeric Zip Code. See, U.S.
Postal Service, 1993 NATIONAL FIVE-DIGIT ZIP CODE &amp; POST OFFICE DIRECTORY. The individual areas defined by the
Zip Codes generally correspond to a district or area with distinctive characteristics. The Zip Code itself is one
distinctive characteristic that ties the area and its residents together. Moreover, most Zip Code areas are further
distinguished by the presence of a postal facility designed to service those neighborhoods. Accordingly, Zip Codes
constitute an existing, comprehensive system for describing areas that generally approximate neighborhoods.

Individual Census Tracts and Census Blocks, by their nature, do not appear to be reasonable alternatives to Zip Codes
to utilize on a general basis. According to the Census Bureau, Census Blocks are small areas bounded on all sides by
visible features such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as city,
town, township, and county limits, property lines, and short, imaginary extensions of streets and roads. Bureau
of the Census, Economics and Statistics Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1990 CENSUS OF HOUSING, GENERAL
HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS (1992). Individual Census Blocks because of their size appear to be inappropriate for determining
the boundaries of a neighborhood served by a financial institution, or a branch thereof on a general basis. Census
Tracts,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 although larger than Census Blocks, are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a country which
usually have between 2,500 and 8,000 persons, and when first delineated, are designed to be homogeneous with respect
to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Bureau of the Census, Economics and Statistics
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1990 CENSUS OF HOUSING, GENERAL HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS (1992).

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Starting with the 1990 Census those areas which are not covered by Census Tracts have been subdivided into ``Block
Numbering Areas'' (BNA's). These BNA's are essentially the equivalent of Census Tracts, except that they have been
delineated by a State agency instead of a local committee.

Individual Census Tracts or Census Blocks are generally impractical for use in defining the boundaries of a neighborhood
served by a financial institution, or a branch thereof, on a generally uniform basis and are inconsistent with the
spirit of the legislation. However, use of Census Tracts or Census Blocks on an individual or aggregate basis may be
appropriate on an exception basis. The Act is intended to enhance opportunities for Minorities to acquire institutions
and branches which primarily ``serve'' Minority residents. 139 Cong. Rec. H10899&hyph;900 (daily ed. November
22, 1993) (statement of Rep. Mfume). The people served by a depository institution or branch may be located over a relatively
large geographic area, generally transcending Census Block boundaries and, most likely, Census Tract boundaries
as well. Census Tracts and Census Blocks tend to be small areas, focused only on residences and are generally not focused
on all residential neighborhoods served by a local financial institution, or a branch office thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Zip Codes (and the boundaries thereof) of offices of a failed institution tend to be larger areas and are readily
ascertainable both by RTC personnel and by potential bidders. Such is not the case for Census Tracts. The addresses
of each of the offices of a failed institution already contain the Zip Code, and the boundaries of each Zip Code area
are available at the local Post Office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the obvious advantages of a definition based on fixed methodology, circumstances may arise where
that approach fails to accurately reflect the reality of the relevant neighborhood. For example, if an institution
or branch is physically located within Zip Code 00001, near the boundary with Zip Code 00002, a mechanical application
of the Zip Code approach would indicate that the branch serves customers in the neighborhood defined by Zip Code 00001.
Or for example, a rigid application of the Zip Code approach to the individual offices of an institution might preclude
the designation of the whole institution as being located in a predominantly minority neighborhood, although other
rational bases might exist for a determination that the institution as a whole is located in a predominantly minority
neighborhood. Therefore, rather than rigidly applying the Zip Code approach, if the RTC determines, in its sole discretion
and subject to its Cost Constraints, that other reasonably reliable information and data, that is readily accessible
to it, indicates different boundaries which more accurately reflect the relevant neighborhood, the RTC may define
the relevant neighborhood in terms of those different boundaries.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RTC's definition of ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' is based on readily available, established and
accepted information: Zip Codes and Census Data. A ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' can, therefore, be
identified using existing, objective standards: (1) A Zip Code to define the geographic area which generally constitutes
the neighborhood and (2) Census Data to determine the minority composition of that neighborhood. In the event that
the RTC, in its sole discretion, determines that other reasonably reliable information and data, that is readily
accessible to it, indicates more accurate boundaries for such neighborhood, the RTC will define such neighborhood
using those more accurate boundaries. The proposed definition permits the RTC to quickly identify ``predominantly
minority neighborhoods'' without delaying the resolution of an institution consistent with the RTC's statutory
Cost Constraints. The methodology adopted by this interim rule constitutes a reasonable basis upon which to define
``predominantly minority neighborhood'' consistent with the purposes of sections 21A(s) and (w)(17) of the FHLBA
and consistent with the RTC's duties in resolving failed institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RTC is adopting this rule as an interim rule. It will be effective immediately upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 without the usual notice and comment period or delayed effective date as provided for in the Administrative Procedure
Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. These requirements may be waived for ``good cause.'' The definition provided by the interim rule
implements the Act. Promulgation of the rule on an expedited basis is necessary to permit the immediate implementation
of the new statute in order to avoid the additional losses that would otherwise be incurred due to the delay in the resolution
of failed institutions pending the usual delayed effective date. Thus, the RTC finds that the benefits to the public
in adopting the interim rule outweigh any possible harm resulting from not seeking comment on the proposed rule in
advance of its effective date. The RTC actively solicits comment on this interim rule and will consider those comments
in the adoption of the rule as final.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis is provided:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Reasons, objectives, and legal bases underlying the interim rule. These elements have been discussed above in
the Supplementary Information section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Small entities to which the rule would apply. This rule applies equally to acquiring institutions of all sizes inasmuch
as the RTC has been given no discretion in this matter by Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Impact of the interim rule on small businesses. There is no burden imposed on small businesses by this rule which
merely defines, pursuant to Congressional direction, a term utilized in the statute.

4. Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. There are no known federal rules that overlap, duplicate, or conflict
with the interim rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Alternatives to the interim rule. The RTC has not identified alternatives that would be less burdensome to small
businesses and yet effectively accomplish the objectives of the rule because there is no burden imposed on small business.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation (Twin
Commander) 500, 520, 560, 680, 681, 685, 690, 695, and 720 series airplanes. This action requires inspecting the flap
system for cables with broken wires or pulleys with worn cable clips, replacing any damaged parts, and replacing the
master pulley and cable with new parts of improved design. Reports of cable fatigue, particularly the master pulley
cable, on several of the affected airplanes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent flap system failure caused by cable
fatigue, which could result in loss of control of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that would apply to certain Twin Commander
500, 520, 560, 680, 681, 685, 690, 695, and 720 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 19, 1993 (58 FR 38540). The action proposed to require inspecting the flap system for cables with broken wires
and pulleys with worn clips, replacing any damaged parts, and replacing the master pulley with a new part of improved
design. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Twin Commander Service Bulletin No. 210, dated
February 1, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, the Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation, supports the proposed rule, and recommends wording the
proposed AD to more closely coincide with Service Bulletin 210, dated February 1, 1991. The FAA concurs and has reworded
the proposal accordingly. This change does not add any additional burden upon U.S. owners/operators of the affected
airplanes than was originally proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other commenter states that a parts availability problem may occur if owners/operators of the affected airplanes
find as many damaged pulleys in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cable system as this owner/operator did on a Model 690B airplane. This commenter feels that there is not sufficient
parts inventory to coincide with the 50-hour time-in-service (TIS) compliance time, and recommends changing the
compliance time to 12 months. The FAA does not concur. Twin Commander has assured the FAA that there will be adequate
parts available for all required repairs. In addition, if a temporary delay in parts availability should occur, then
an owner/operator could request an extension of the compliance time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through instructions specified in paragraph (d) of the proposed AD. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this
comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the wording changes referenced above and minor editorial corrections.
The FAA has determined that these minor changes and corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional
burden upon the public than was already proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 1,860 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
25 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55
an hour. Parts cost approximately $600 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $3,673,500. This figure is based upon the assumption that none of the affected airplane
operators have accomplished the required actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the
criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action is contained in
the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action amends 15 CFR Part 303, which governs duty-exemption allocations and duty-refund entitlements for watch
producers in the United States' insular possessions (the Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa) and the Northern
Mariana Islands. The amendments establish the total quantity and territorial shares of duty-exemption for 1994
and adjust the wages considered creditable towards the production incentive certificate (PIC).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The insular possessions' watch industry provision in Section 110 of Public Law 97&hyph;446 (96 Stat. 2331) (1983)
(19 U.S.C. 1202, note) requires the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior, acting jointly, to establish
a limit on the quantity of watches and watch movements which may be entered free of duty during each calendar year. The
law also requires the Secretaries to establish the shares of this limited quantity which may be entered from the Virgin
Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. Regulations on the establishment of these quantities
and shares are contained in &sect;&sect;303.3 and 303.4 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations (15 CFR 303.3 and
303.4). Section 303.6(h) gives the Secretaries authority to make the changes in &sect;303.14.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule also modifies &sect;303.14(a)(1)(i) by increasing the dollar amount of wages per person that the Departments
can consider in calculating the producers' allocations and PICs. The limit is raised to $35,000 in order to help attract
and retain the managerial talent necessary to operate efficient watch assembly plants.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to revise the
definition of ``supercomputers''. This final rule increases the ``supercomputer'' threshold level from a CTP (composite
theoretical performance) equal to or exceeding 195 Mtops (million theoretical operations per second) to a CTP equal
to or exceeding 1,500 Mtops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule also increases the General License GFW eligibility level for digital computers controlled by ECCN 4A03A
to a CTP of 500 Mtops or less for eligible countries listed in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Special Country List (i.e.,
Supplement No. 4) and 1,000 Mtops or less for other eligible countries. To conform with recent COCOM changes to the
International Industrial List (IL), this rule makes General License G&hyph;DEST available for exports of ``digital''
computers with a ``CTP'' not exceeding 260 Mtops, except to Country Groups S and Z, Iran, Syria, and South African military
and police entities. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control maintains an embargo on other
destinations, such as Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this rule raises the level at which nuclear nonproliferation controls apply to digital computers controlled
by ECCNs 4A01A, 4A02A, and 4A03A. Nuclear nonproliferation controls now apply to computers with a CTP exceeding 500
Mtops for countries listed in Supplement No. 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule makes more computers eligible for export under the special license procedures because the eligibility
levels for certain countries are tied to either the supercomputer threshold level or the nuclear nonproliferation
control level for computers, both of which are increased by this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this rule revises the Technical Note in the Commerce Control List that provides instructions on calculating
``CTP''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This interim rule revises the definition of a supercomputer, expands the General License GFW eligibility level for
digital computers controlled by ECCN 4A03A, raises the levels at which nuclear nonproliferation controls apply
to computers controlled by ECCNs 4A01A, 4A02A, and 4A03A, and makes more computers eligible for export under the special
license procedures.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In international negotiations with our partner in the supercomputer regime, we have reached agreement on a new supercomputer
threshold level. Accordingly, this rule revises the definition of ``supercomputer'' in &sect;770.2 and &sect;776.11(a)
to increase the supercomputer threshold level from a CTP (composite theoretical performance) equal to or exceeding
195 Mtops (million theoretical operations per second) to a CTP equal to or exceeding 1,500 Mtops. The United States
continues to seek an agreement that would increase the supercomputer threshold level to 2,000 Mtops. Following the
completion of negotiations with our supercomputer partner, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) intends to
publish a rule that will revise the supercomputer safeguards that apply to certain countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also increases the General License GFW eligibility level for digital computers controlled by ECCN 4A03A
from a CTP less than 195 Mtops to a CTP of 500 Mtops or less for eligible countries listed in Supplement No. 4 to part 778
and a CTP of 1,000 Mtops or less for other eligible countries. Subject to the restrictions in &sect;771.2(c), items
eligible for General License GFW may be exported to most destinations in Country Groups T and V. General License GFW
is not available for exports to Iran, Syria, the People's Republic of China, or the South African military or police
and a validated license continues to be required for exports of all computers controlled by ECCN 4A03A to these destinations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To conform with recent COCOM changes to the International Industrial List (IL), this rule amends the Validated License
Required paragraph in ECCN 4A03A to indicate that General License G&hyph;DEST is available for exports of ``digital''
computers with a ``CTP'' not exceeding 260 Mtops, except to Country Groups S and Z, Iran, Syria, and South African military
and police entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National security-based validated license requirements continue to apply to: (1) Exports of ``digital computers''
with a CTP exceeding 260 Mtops to controlled destinations and to all other destinations not eligible for General License
GFW and (2) exports to GFW-eligible destinations of ``digital computers'' that exceed the GFW eligibility levels
(i.e., 500 Mtops or less for eligible Supplement No. 4 countries and 1,000 Mtops or less for other eligible countries).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Foreign policy-based validated license requirements remain in effect for exports of computers controlled by ECCNs
4A03A and 4A94F (i.e., computers with a CTP of 6 Mtops or greater) to Iran or Syria and for exports of all computers to
Country Groups S and Z, and South African military and police entities. Exporters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should also be aware that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control maintains an embargo on
other destinations, such as Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also amends ECCNs 4A01A, 4A02A, and 4A03A to increase the level at which nuclear nonproliferation controls
apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computers. Nuclear nonproliferation controls now apply only for exports of computers with a CTP exceeding 500 Mtops
to countries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in Supplement No. 4 to part 778. Previously, nuclear nonproliferation controls applied to computers with
a CTP of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
195 Mtops or above for countries listed in Supplement No. 4 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 778. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule makes more computers eligible for export under the special license procedures. Destinations that are not
subject to nuclear nonproliferation controls, and not eligible to receive supercomputers under the special license
procedures, are eligible to receive computers below the new supercomputer threshold level, i.e., 1,500 Mtops. Countries
for which exports of computers with a CTP above 500 Mtops are subject to nuclear nonproliferation controls are now
eligible to receive computers with a CTP of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
500 Mtops or less.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 772.1 is amended by adding a new paragraph (h) to inform exporters that validated license conditions are terminated
when items are decontrolled. Exporters who have received validated licenses containing restrictive conditions
for items that are now eligible for shipment under a general license (e.g., General Licenses GFW, GCT, or G-DEST) may
use the appropriate general license to export such items, subject only to the specific conditions that apply to the
use of these general licenses. Exporters should be aware, however, of the general prohibitions in &sect;771.2(c)
concerning the use of general licenses and of the validated license requirements that apply to certain nuclear, missile
technology, or chemical-biological weapons activities described in &sect;778.3, &sect;778.7, &sect;778.8,
and &sect;778.9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this rule revises the Technical Note under the heading ``Information on How to Calculate Composite Theoretical
Performance (CTP)'' at the end of Category 4 in the Commerce Control List (CCL). The changes in this Technical Note
may affect the control status of certain computers (e.g., eligibility for export under General License G-DEST, GFW,
or GCT), as well as whether or not a computer is treated as a supercomputer.

Saving Clause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Shipments of items removed from general license authorizations as a result of this regulatory action that were on
dock for loading, on lighter, laden aboard an exporting carrier, or en route aboard carrier to a port of export pursuant
to actual orders for export before March 10, 1994 may be exported under the previous general license provisions up
to and including March 24, 1994. Any such items not actually exported before midnight March 24, 1994, require a validated
export license in accordance with this regulation.

Rulemaking Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694&hyph;0005,
0694&hyph;0010, 0694&hyph;0013, 0694&hyph;0015, and 0694&hyph;0073. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
opportunity for public participation, and a delay in the effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation
involves a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice
of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on
this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Willard Fisher, Office of Technology
and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

Exporters who have shipped under validated licenses containing conditions that would not apply to an export under
a general license, and foreign consignees who have agreed to such conditions, are no longer bound by the conditions
when the licensed items become eligible for shipment under a general license (e.g., GFW, GCT, G&hyph;DEST). Items
that were exported under such licenses remain subject to the conditions of permissive reexports and any applicable
general licenses on which they are based, as well as the general prohibitions in &sect;771.2(c) of this subchapter
on the use of general licenses. Termination of validated license conditions does not relieve persons of responsibility
for any violations that may have occurred before availability of a general license.

Outline of ``CTP'' Calculation Method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``CTP'' is a measure of computational performance given in millions of theoretical operations per second (Mtops).
In calculating the ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') of an aggregation of ``Computing Elements''
(``CEs''), the following three steps are required: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Calculate the effective calculating rate (R) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each ``computing element'' (``CE''); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Apply the word length adjustment (L) to the effective calculating rate (R), resulting in a Theoretical Performance
(TP) for each ``computing element'' (``CE''); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If there is more than one ``computing element'' (``CE''), combine the Theoretical Performances (TPs), resulting
in a ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') for the aggregation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Details for these steps are given in the following section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note 1:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 For aggregations of multiple ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') that have both shared and unshared memory subsystems,
the calculation of ``CTP'' is completed hierarchically, in two steps: first, aggregate the groups of ``computing
elements'' (``CEs'') sharing memory; second calculate the ``CTP'' of the groups using the calculation method for
multiple ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') not sharing memory.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Computing elements'' (``CEs'') that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive,
communication and video display controllers) are not aggregated into the ``CTP'' calculation.

cycle are to be treated as multiple separate ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') performing simultaneously (e.g.,

an addition in one cycle and the second performing a multiplication in one cycle).

Rates should be calculated for all supported operand lengths considering both pipelined operations (if supported),
and non-pipelined operations, using the fastest executing instruction for each operand length based on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Pipelined or register-to-register operations. Exclude extraordinarily short execution times generated for
operations on a predetermined operand or operands (for example, multiplication by 0 or 1). If no register-to-register
operations are implemented, continue with (2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The faster of register-to-memory or memory-to-register operations; if these also do not exist, then continue
with (3).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Memory-to-memory.

For aggregrations that do not allow all of the ``CEs'' to run simultaneously, the possible combination of ``CEs''
that provides the largest ``CTP'' should be used. The TP of each contributing ``CE'' is to be calculated at its maximum
value theoretically possible before the ``CTP'' of the combination is derived.

To determine the possible combinations of simultaneously operating ``CEs'', generate an instruction sequence
that initiates operations in multiple ``CEs'', beginning with the slowest ``CE'' (the one needing the largest number
of cycles to complete its operation) and ending with the fastest ``CE''. At each cycle of the sequence, the combination
of ``CEs'' that are in operation during that cycle is a possible combination.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 30, 1993, Customs published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 69460) T.D. 94&hyph;1 to set forth interim amendments to the Customs Regulations to implement the preferential
tariff treatment and other Customs-related provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which
was adopted by the United States through the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act (``the Act''), Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057. Those interim regulatory amendments took effect on January
1, 1994, to coincide with the effective date of the NAFTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document corrects some errors published in T.D. 94&hyph;1. Two errors involved amended &sect;24.22: (1) Paragraph
(g)(1), as revised in the document, failed to fully reflect the change in wording of section 13031(a)(5) of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(5)) effected by section 521 of the Act for fiscal years
1994 through 1997; and (2) the document failed to amend paragraph (g)(2)(iv) to avoid a conflict between that paragraph
and the amended statutory and paragraph (g)(1) language. In new &sect;181.45, a printing error involving the text
of paragraph (a) before the example is corrected by rearranging the text without any change in substance. In addition,
in order to ensure coverage of all appropriate litigation contexts involving Customs and its officers or agents,
at the end of new &sect;&sect;181.98(b) and 181.116(f) the word ``defendant'' is corrected to read ``party to the
action''. Finally, this document corrects a number of drafting or typesetting errors of an editorial nature.

reflect changes to the commercial passenger arrival fee provisions of section 13031 of the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58c) effected by section 521 of the Act. The changes involve, for fiscal
years 1994 through 1997 (in effect, from January 1, 1994 through September 30, 1997), (1) replacement of the words
``from a place outside the United States'' by the words ``from outside the customs territory of the United States'',
(2) an increase in the fee from $5 to $6.50, and (3) suspension of the fee exemption for persons whose journey involves
certain specified locations outside the United States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 13, 1992 (57 FR 12831), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 2B4316) had been filed by SCM Chemicals,
c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite 500 West, Washington, DC 20001. The petition proposed that the food additive regulations
in &sect;175.300 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Resinous and polymeric coatings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 175.300) be amended to provide for the safe use of trimethylolpropane as a pigment dispersant in resinous and
polymeric coatings in contact with food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed use of the
additive is safe and that the regulations in &sect;175.300 should be amended as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 28, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34058), FDA announced that two food additive petitions (FAP's 3B4357 and 3B4359) had been filed
by Sumitomo Chemical America, Inc., 345 Park Ave., New York, NY 10154, proposing that food additive regulations be
amended in &sect;178.2010

block polymers that contact food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has evaluated data in the petitions and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed uses of
the additive are safe and that the regulations in &sect;178.2010 should be amended as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petitions are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 28, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has evaluated data submitted in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval of a new antibiotic drug,
cefadroxil hemihydrate, and its use in two dosage forms, cefadroxil hemihydrate capsules and cefadroxil hemihydrate
tablets. The agency has concluded that the data supplied by the manufacturer concerning these antibiotic drugs are
adequate to establish their safety and efficacy when used as directed in the labeling and that the regulations should
be amended in 21 CFR parts 436 and 442 to provide for the inclusion of accepted standards for these products.

Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Submitting Comments and Filing Objections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because
this final rule is not controversial and because when effective it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds
that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective
March 28, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before March 28, 1994, submit comments to the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy.
Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments
may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before March 28, 1994,
a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before April 25, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
supplementary information: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 1, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 31180). DEA proposed to limit the exemption from payment of registration or reregistration application fees
to Federal, state or local government operated hospital/clinics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of three comments were received, all opposed to the proposed changes. Two of the comments concerned state certified
euthanasia technicians. The commentors objected to the changes on the grounds that the change would impose a financial
burden on the euthanasia technicians and the animal shelters at which they work, due to the extremely high turnover
rate the industry experiences. This will not be the case. The euthanasia technicians are employees of animal control
facilities or shelters. They may not engage in their activities other than as employees of the facilities or shelters.
Under such circumstances, DEA has traditionally issued the registrations for such activities under the facility
or shelter name with the euthanasia technician's name appearing thereafter. It is appropriate under such circumstances
for the Federal, state or local government facility or shelter to request and receive the exemption from the fee. In
light of the fact that DEA registers these activities as other than a hospital or clinic, the original language of the
proposal with respect to Federal, state or local hospitals or clinics has been changed to Federal, state or local hospitals
or other institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third commentor objected to the changes on the grounds that the proposed changes, if implemented, would prevent
public sector employees from using their exempt status to obtain registrations for use in private practice. That
is the exact intent of the proposal. Any individual who engages in private practice utilizing a DEA registration must
pay the required fee for that registration. Individuals who engage in public practice as agents or employees of Federal,
state or local hospitals or institutions would not be required to obtain a registration; they would conduct their
controlled substances activities under the registration of the hospital or institution. Although this has been
a longstanding policy, DEA will clarify the provisions for such activities in light of the impact that the limiting
of the fee exemption will have. A proposal to amend &sect;1301.24 has been drafted to clarify the exemption from the
registration requirement of individual practitioners who act as agents or employees of other individual practitioners
and of hospitals or other institutions. That proposal will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the near future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 44,000 active DEA registrations which were issued under the fee exempt status. Over 35,000
of the registrations are for practitioners and the remainder are for Federal, state or local hospitals or institutions.
By restricting the fee exempt status to the hospitals or institutions and allowing the practitioners to carry out
their official duties under the hospital or institution registrations, DEA will eliminate the need to dedicate manpower
or other resources to controlling the misuse of the fee exempt status.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This final rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612, and it has been
determined that the final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 4, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking (PS&hyph;50&hyph;92) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 44) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 1) under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Written comments responding to the notice were received, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a public hearing was held on April 5, 1993. After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of all written and oral comments regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed amendments, those amendments are adopted as revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this Treasury decision.

Changes Made by the Final Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations generally describe an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative error and omission and include illustrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examples. Commentators have requested that the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations include an ``accounting error'' as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative error or omission. The Service and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury Department are concerned that the term ``accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
error'' is too vague. However, in order to address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commentators' concerns, the final regulations clarify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an administrative error or omission includes an error in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tracking the housing credit dollar amount an Agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated (or that remains to be allocated) in a calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. For example, assume an Agency, believing that it has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$100 of credit remaining in its credit ceiling for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current calendar year, allocates $100 to a project and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agrees to allocate an additional $30 from the next calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year's credit ceiling. Later, in the current calendar year, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency discovers that it failed to include in its credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ceiling for the current calendar year $50 of credits that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were returned in the current calendar year. The error in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tracking the $50 of credits that were returned is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative error or omission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commentator asked for clarification of the correction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure an Agency should use when correcting a document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the Secretary's prior approval. Under the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, a document that corrects a document containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an error or omission that has not yet been filed with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Service should be filed as the original. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a document containing an error has already been filed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Internal Revenue Service, the Agency should refile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a copy of the document containing the error that prominently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and clearly notes the correction. The Agency should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate at the top of the document(s) that the correction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is being made under &sect;1.42&hyph;13 of the Income Tax Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations require that an Agency obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prior approval of the Secretary to correct an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative error or omission if (1) the correction is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not made before the close of the calendar year of the error 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or omission, and (2) the correction is a numerical change to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the housing credit dollar amount allocated for the building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or project. One commentator suggested that an Agency should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have until February 28, the date by which an Agency must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file its Form 8610, to correct an administrative error or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
omission that changes the housing credit dollar amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated to a building or project without obtaining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's prior approval. Another commentator made a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar suggestion solely for credits returned in the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year in which they were allocated. These suggestions have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not been adopted. Section 42(h)(1) requires that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation for a certain calendar year be made by the close 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that calendar year. Consistent with that approach, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations do not permit an Agency to make a post-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation without the Secretary's prior approval. Of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course, for a correction of an administrative error or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
omission that an Agency cannot correct on its own, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency, or the Agency and the affected taxpayer, may seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary's prior approval.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12866. It also has been determined that section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, a copy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on its impact on small business.

Under section 42(n), the Secretary has authority to prescribe regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry

Revenue Bulletin. (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

Correcting administrative errors and omissions_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Agency may correct an administrative error or omission with respect to allocations and recordkeeping, as described
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, within a reasonable period after the Agency discovers the administrative error
or omission. Whether a correction is made within a reasonable period depends on the facts and circumstances of each
situation. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, an Agency need not obtain the prior approval
of the Secretary to correct an administrative error or omission, if the correction is made in accordance with paragraph
(b)(3)(i) of this section. The administrative errors and omissions to which this paragraph (b) applies are strictly
limited to those described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and, thus, do not include, for example, any misinterpretation
of the applicable rules and regulations under section 42. Accordingly, an Agency's allocation of a particular calendar
year's low-income housing credit dollar amount made after the close of that calendar year, or the use of an incorrect
population amount in calculating a State's housing credit ceiling for a calendar year are not administrative errors
that can be corrected under this paragraph (b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Administrative errors and omissions described. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An administrative error or omission is a mistake that results in a document that inaccurately reflects the intent
of the Agency at the time the document is originally completed or, if the mistake affects a taxpayer, a document that
inaccurately reflects the intent of the Agency and the affected taxpayer at the time the document is originally completed.
Administrative errors and omissions described in this paragraph (b)(2) include the following_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A mathematical error;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An entry on a document that is inconsistent with another entry on the same or another document regarding the same
property, or taxpayer;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A failure in tracking the housing credit dollar amount an Agency has allocated (or that remains to be allocated)
in the current calendar year (e.g., a failure to include in its State housing credit ceiling a previously allocated
credit dollar amount that has been returned by a taxpayer);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) An omission of information that is required on a document; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Any other type of error or omission identified by guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of this chapter) as an administrative error or omission covered by this paragraph (b).

Procedures for correcting administrative errors or omissions_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Agency's correction of an administrative error or omission, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section,
must amend the document so that the corrected document reflects the original intent of the Agency, or the Agency and
the affected taxpayer, and complies with applicable rules and regulations under section 42.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specific procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a document corrects a document containing an administrative error or omission that has not yet been filed with the
Internal Revenue Service, the Agency, or the Agency and the affected taxpayer, should complete and file the corrected
document as the original. When a document containing an administrative error or omission has already been filed with
the Service, the Agency, or the Agency and the affected taxpayer, should refile a copy of the document containing the
administrative error or omission, and prominently and clearly note the correction thereon or on an attached new document.
The Agency should indicate at the top of the document(s) that the correction is being made under &sect;1.42&hyph;13
of the Income Tax Regulations.

Secretary's prior approval required. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Agency must obtain the Secretary's prior approval to correct an administrative error or omission, as described
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if the correction is not made before the close of the calendar year of the error
or omission and the correction_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Is a numerical change to the housing credit dollar amount allocated for the building or project;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Affects the determination of any component of the State's housing credit ceiling under section 42(h)(3)(C);
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Affects the State's unused housing credit carryover that is assigned to the Secretary under section 42(h)(3)(D).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requesting the Secretary's approval. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To obtain the Secretary's approval under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, an Agency must submit a request for
the Secretary's approval within a reasonable period after discovering the administrative error or omission, and
must agree to any conditions that may be required by the Secretary under paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section. When
requesting the Secretary's approval, the Agency, or the Agency and the affected taxpayer, must file an application
that complies with the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3)(iv). For further information on the application procedure
see Rev. Proc. 93&hyph;1, 1993&hyph;1 I.R.B. 10 (or any subsequent applicable revenue procedure). (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of this chapter.) The application requesting the Secretary's approval must contain the following information_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The name, address, and identification number of each affected taxpayer;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Building Identification Number (B.I.N.) and address of each building or project affected by the administrative
error or omission;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A statement explaining the administrative error or omission and the intent of the Agency, or of the Agency and the
affected taxpayer, when the document was originally completed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Copies of any supporting documentation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) A statement explaining the effect, if any, that a correction of the administrative error or omission would have
on the housing credit dollar amount allocated for any building or project; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) A statement explaining the effect, if any, that a correction of the administrative error or omission would have
on the determination of the components of the State's housing credit ceiling under section 42(h)(3)(C) or on the State's
unused housing credit carryover that is assigned to the Secretary under section 42(h)(3)(D).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Agreement to conditions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To obtain the Secretary's approval under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, an Agency, or the Agency and the affected
taxpayer, must agree to the conditions the Secretary considers appropriate.

Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Individual B applied to Agency X for a reservation of a low-income housing credit dollar amount for a building that
is part of a low-income housing project. When applying for the low-income housing credit dollar amount, B informed
Agency X that B intended to form Partnership Y to finance the project. After receiving the reservation letter and prior
to receiving an allocation, B formed Partnership Y and sold partnership interests to a number of limited partners.
B contributed the low-income housing project to Partnership Y in exchange for a partnership interest. B and Partnership
Y informed Agency X of the ownership change. When actually allocating the housing credit dollar amount, Agency X sent
Partnership Y a document listing B, rather than Partnership Y, as the building's owner. Partnership Y promptly notified
Agency X of the error. After reviewing related documents, Agency X determined that it had incorrectly listed B as the
building's owner on the allocation document. Since the parties originally intended that Partnership Y would receive
the allocation as the owner of the building, Agency X may correct the error without obtaining the Secretary's approval,
and insert Partnership Y as the building's owner on the allocation document.

Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Agency Y allocated a lower low-income housing credit dollar amount for a low-income housing building than Agency
Y originally intended. After the close of the calendar year of the allocation, B, the building's owner, discovered
the error and promptly notified Agency Y. Agency Y reviewed relevant documents and agreed that an error had occurred.
Agency Y and B must apply, as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, for the Secretary's approval before
Agency Y may correct the error.

regulations to administrative errors or omissions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred before the publication of these regulations. Any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable method used by a State or local housing credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency to correct an administrative error or omission prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to February 24, 1994, will be considered proper, provided that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the method is consistent with the rules of section 42.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On May 18, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Kentucky program. Information pertinent
to the general background, revisions, modifications, and amendments to the proposed permanent program submission,
as well as the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval
can be found in the May 18, 1982, Federal Register (47 FR 21404&hyph;21435). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions
of approval and program amendments are identified at 30 CFR 917.11, 917.13, 917.15, 917.16, and 917.17.

II. Submission of Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
By letter dated May 21, 1993, (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1221) Kentucky submitted proposed amendments
containing additions and modifications to 405 KAR 10:050 Bond forfeiture, 405 KAR 12:001 Definitions, and 405 FAR
12:010 General provisions for inspection and enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendments in the June 11, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 32618), and in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the adequacy of the proposed amendments. The comment period closed on July 12, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 14, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1226), Kentucky revised the proposed amendment at 405 KAR 12:001
by adding a definition of the term ``unwarranted failure to comply'', since that term is used in 405 KAR 12:020 section
8. The proposed definition is identical to the existing definition set forth in 405 KAR 7:001. Since the definition
already exists as part of Kentucky's approved program, the Director determined that no purpose would be served by
reopening the public comment period for the modification submitted by Kentucky on June 14, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated October 19, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1242), Kentucky submitted a proposed program
amendment which was intended to replace the proposals submitted on May 21, 1993, and June 14, 1993. The regulations
contained in the October 19, 1993, submission completed the Kentucky promulgation process under Kentucky Revised
Statue Chapter 13A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17 are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendments to the Kentucky program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In several sections of the regulations affected by this amendment, Kentucky is proposing to revise the use of the terms
``permittee'', ``operator'', and ``person'' in order to achieve consistency in the use of the terms and to more clearly
identify the entities that are intended to be subject to the particular statutory requirements involved. The Director
finds that the proposed revisions add clarity to Kentucky's rules and are no less effective than the Federal regulations
as listed below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Kentucky proposes to add a definition of ``willfully and willful violation'' which is identical to the definition
currently found in Kentucky's program at 405 KAR 7:001, 8:001 and 10:001, and which was approved by the Director on
October 1, 1992 (57 FR 45297). The Director finds that this definition was previously approved in other sections of
the Kentucky program and the proposal to add it to 405 KAR Chapter 12 will not render Kentucky's regulations less effective
than the Federal program.

3. 405 KAR 12:010 General Provisions for Inspection and Enforcement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Kentucky proposes to revise its regulations governing frequency of inspections set forth at 405 KAR 12:010 section
3(5) (a) by providing an exception to the monthly partial inspection requirement where the cabinet has received notice
of temporary cessation of operations. As proposed for revision, if the cabinet has received notice of temporary cessation,
the partial inspections shall continue until the cabinet determines that the permit area is sufficiently stable
to insure that the quarterly complete inspections required by 405 KAR 12:010 section 3(5)(b) will provide adequate
inspection of the permit area. The Federal rule at 30 CFR 840.11(a) provides for ``partial inspections of each inactive
surface coal mining and reclamation operation .&blank;.&blank;. as are necessary to ensure effective enforcement
of the approved State program.'' 30 CFR 840.11(f) (1) includes as an inactive surface coal mining and reclamation
operation one for which the regulatory authority has received written notice of temporary cessation of mining. The
Director finds that the proposed rule represents reasonable exercise of Kentucky's discretion under 30 CFR 840.11(a)
and is no less effective than the Federal counterparts at 30 CFR 840.11 (a) and (f).

1. General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Kentucky proposes to revise the introductory material at 405 KAR 10:050 and 405 KAR 12:010 to include appropriate
statutory and regulatory citations relating to the materials covered by the respective regulations. The Director
finds that the inclusion of this material is not inconsistent with any requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. In proposed revisions to the Necessity and Function sections of 405 KAR 10:050, 12:001 and 12:010, as well as 405
KAR 10:050 section 1(1) and 405 KAR 12:010 section 4(3), Kentucky refers to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
administrative regulations,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than just 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as currently expressed in those provisions. The Director finds that the proposed revisions add appropriate clarity
to the State's program and do not adversely affect any requirement of SMCRA or the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Kentucky proposes to revise the Necessity and Function section of 405 KAR 10:050 by adding the following clarifying
sentence:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This administrative regulation establishes criteria under which unused forfeited bond funds shall be returned
to the person from whom they were collected.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director finds that this proposed addition will not render Kentucky's program inconsistent with any provisions
of the Federal program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Kentucky proposes to revise this regulation by adding section 2(5) which provides for the return of unused forfeited
bond funds to the person from whom they were received, subject to the right to attach or set-off the funds under state
law. The provision applies where the cabinet has not completed the reclamation plan on the forfeited site and the site,
including any related off-site disturbances, is completely overlapped by a subsequent permanent program permit
and is completely disturbed by the overlapping permittee. As proposed, the provision is limited to interim program
sites forfeited on or after July 15, 1988, and to forfeited permanent program sites. While there is no direct Federal
counterpart to this proposal, the Director has determined that it is not inconsistent with the Federal rule at 30 CFR
800.50(d)(2) which provides for the return of unused funds to the person from whom they were collected where the amount
of performance bond forfeited is more than the amount necessary to complete reclamation. Therefore, the Director
finds that the proposal is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations.

The Kentucky Resources Council (KRC) filed written comments on July 23, 1993 (Administrative Record Number KY&hyph;1331),
and supplemented those comments on November 30, 1993 (Administrative Record Number KY&hyph;1259). A summary of
those comments and their disposition is set forth below.

KRC expressed concern that the revisions to subsection (5) might result in the release of forfeited bonds in cases
where the permit area is completely disturbed under an overlapping permit, and where there is off-permit disturbance
that should be addressed under the forfeited bond. As a result of the concerns raised by KRC, Kentucky revised 405 KAR
10:050 section 2(5) in its October 19, 1993, resubmission by making specific reference to the inclusion of any off-site
disturbance. In its November 30, 1993, letter, after reviewing Kentucky's revisions, KRC restated its concern with
particular reference to ``those cases, for example, where the former mining operation has caused damage to the hydrologic
balance (such as loss or damage to water supplies, pollution of groundwater resources), or where other off-site damage
might not be readily apparent or yet manifest, the allowance of a return of unused bond funds where the site is overlapped
by a new permit and bond may result in unfunded liabilities''. In its Statement of Consideration (Administrative
Record Number KY&hyph;1333) filed by Kentucky on September 2, 1993, the State discusses these issues in some detail.
In specific response to KRC's original concerns, Kentucky stated that it ``has no intention of releasing forfeited
bond funds when there is off-permit disturbance for which the original bond stands liable and such disturbance was
not encompassed in the overlapping permit.'' In response to comments filed by another party (Item 7, Statement of
Consideration), Kentucky stated that ``[T]he original permittee's bond does not become ``unused'' and ``more than
the amount necessary to do reclamation'' within the meaning of KRS 350.131(2) until the new permittee disturbs the
entire overlapped area, triggering a reclamation obligation on his behalf. Prior to that, the new permittee could
delete the unreclaimed area from its permit. The Cabinet must be assured that the original forfeited funds will in
fact be unnecessary before it can release the funds.'' Finally, in response to KRC's concern regarding liabilities
that may not become apparent until after a bond has been released, there is no authority in SMCRA or the Federal regulations
to retain bond funds after all release requirements have been met, for such unknown liabilities. The State can always
pursue the original permittee if such liabilities occur. The Director feels that the clarification provided by Kentucky
adequately responds to the concerns raised by KRC.

KRC objects to the proposed definition of ``willfully and willful violation'' because it appears to impose a higher
burden for demonstrating the willfulness of a violation than does the Federal counterpart at 30 CFR 843.5. The State's
definition was previously considered and approved by OSM in a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice dated October 1, 1992 (57 FR 45295). In that approval, the Director observed ``[T]he Federal regulations provide
separate definitions for ``willfully'' at 30 CFR 846.5, and ``willful violation'' at 30 CFR 701.5 and 843.5. Unlike
the Federal definition of ``willful violation'', Kentucky's proposed combined definition does not stipulate that
the person who committed the act or omission must have intended the result that actually occurs. However, since Kentucky's
proposed definition includes all intentional acts and omissions, it will necessarily include all acts and omissions
specified in the Federal definitions. Because Kentucky's proposed combined definition will result in sanctions
and penalties no less stringent than those resulting from the separate Federal definitions, the Director finds that
the proposal is no less effective than the Federal regulations.'' Based upon the same reasoning as discussed above,
the Director is approving the proposed addition of the definition at 405 KAR 12:001(30).

KRC has raised two concerns regarding the reduction in inspection frequency proposed in section 3(5). KRC feels that
the proposal is ambiguous as to whether or not a finding of site stability must precede any reduction of inspection
frequency. In response to this concern, the State, in its Statement of Considerations dated August 13, 1993 (Administrative
Record No. KY&hyph;1333), pointed out that ``[A]fter a notice of temporary cessation is filed, the regulations require
the cabinet to conduct partial inspections until the cabinet determines that the permit area is sufficiently stable
with respect to mass stability, erosion, revegetation, water quality, and other reclamation requirements so that
quarterly complete inspections will provide adequate inspection of the permit area.'' OSM feels that the State's
explanation of its interpretation of this regulation resolves the concern raised by KRC. The second concern expressed
by KRC involves the State's reference to reduction in partial inspection frequency upon completion of Phase I reclamation.
The cited reference was approved by OSM on May 18, 1982 (47 FR 21404), and has not been submitted to OSM for reconsideration
as part of the current amendment. However, OSM feels that the issue requires further review, in light of the counterpart
Federal rule at 30 CFR 840.11(f)(2) published on August 16, 1982 (47 FR 35620). If, as a result of that review, OSM determines
that revisions to Kentucky's regulations are required, action in accordance with 30 CFR Part 732 will be taken to insure
that Kentucky's program is no less effective than the Federal counterpart.

Agency Comments

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations of 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited
from various government agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Kentucky program. The U.S. Forest Service,
the Bureau of Land Management, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Soil Conservation Service responded
but did not have any substantive comments on the proposed rules. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)
raised two concerns in their response. In connection with the bond forfeiture procedures at 405 KAR 10:050 section
2(4), MSHA feels that the word ``operator'' should be deleted from this section since the agency questions how the
operator could be held liable if the operator is no longer on the site and/or has no interest in the bond. However, the
question of liability is one of fact to be determined in each individual case. In addition, the use of the term operator
is not part of the current amendment inasmuch as the term already exists in section 2(4) and is not part of the proposed
revisions. Therefore, the Director is taking no action regarding this comment.

MSHA also feels that 405 KAR 12:010 section 3(5)(a), regarding inspection frequency, should be revised in order to
clarify that a reduction in partial inspection frequency cannot occur until after Phase I reclamation. In reviewing
the proposed revisions to section 3(5)(a), as discussed in Finding III.B.2. herein, the Director has determined
that Kentucky's proposal is no less effective than the Federal counterpart at 30 CFR 840.11 (a) and (f). The Federal
rule clearly provides the regulatory authority with certain discretion in conducting partial inspections of inactive
surface coal mining and reclamation operations. In subsection (f), the rule identifies an inactive site as one for
which the regulatory authority has received notice of temporary cessation of operations. Kentucky's proposal is
consistent with the Federal rule in that it allows for a reduction in partial inspections upon completion of Phase
I reclamation, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 upon receipt of notification of temporary cessation of operations. Therefore, the Director believes that the proposal
is acceptable as submitted.

Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the program amendment as submitted by Kentucky on May 21, 1993,
and revised and resubmitted on June 14, 1993, and October 19, 1993. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 917 codifying
decisions concerning the Kentucky program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being
made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage the State to conform
its program with the Federal standards without delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate
to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of the
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10),
decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely
on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and
whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

 EPA is approving a State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. This revision establishes
and requires the implementation of primary and secondary particulate matter standards consistent with the National
ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM&hyph;10). The intended effect of this action is
to approve five (5) regulations, amended by Maryland in order to conform with the requirements established for Group
III areas for PM&hyph;10. This action is being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 1, 1989, the Maryland Department of the Environment submitted a revision to the Maryland State implementation
plan (SIP) to achieve and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM&hyph;10).
The revision consists of: (1) An amended Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 10.18.01&hyph;''General Administrative
Provisions''; (2) An amended COMAR 10.18.02&hyph;''Permits, Approvals, and Registrations''; (3) An amended COMAR
10.18.03&hyph;''State-Adopted National Ambient Air Quality Standards and Guidelines''; (4) An amended COMAR
10.18.05&hyph;''Air Pollution Episode System''; and (5) An amended COMAR 10.18.06&hyph;''General Emission Standards,
Prohibitions, and Restrictions''.

Summary of SIP Revision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic
diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10) (52 FR 24634). The PM&hyph;10 standards replace
the total suspended particulate (TSP) standards promulgated by EPA in 1971. Also on July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated
changes to the policies and regulations by which it will implement the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in 40 CFR parts 51 and 52
(52 FR 24672).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the classification criteria established at 52 FR 24672, EPA has preliminarily designated areas within each
State as Group I, II, or III based upon an area's probability of attaining the PM&hyph;10 standard. The July 1, 1987

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice requires State implementation plan (SIP) revisions for all classified Group I, II, and III areas and indicates
the SIP revision requirements for each classification.

On August 7, 1987, the State of Maryland was classified at 52 FR 29383 as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act as amended (1990 Amendments) affects these classifications, and the associated requirements,
in a number of ways. The 1990 Amendments eliminated the need for States to seek approval of ``committal'' SIP revisions
for Group II areas as prescribed in the July 1, 1987 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Group II areas are to be addressed using the authorities established in section 107 of the Clean Air Act concerning
the classification of areas as attainment or nonattainment with regard to the NAAQS. EPA has determined that sufficient
evidence does not exist to redesignate the City of Baltimore as nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 at this time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 Amendments did not affect the requirements established for Group III areas. The July 1, 1987 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requires States to seek approval of SIP revisions as required under the preconstruction review program and to codify
other minor regulatory changes as needed. It is presumed that the existing Maryland SIP is adequate to demonstrate
attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in all Group III areas in the State. On March 1, 1989, the State
of Maryland responded to the July, 1, 1987 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by submitting five (5) regulations amended to reflect the revised particulate matter standards as a SIP revision.
This SIP revision addresses Group III areas only.

EPA Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has evaluated Maryland's SIP revision request and concluded the following: (1) The amended regulations conform
with the revised primary and secondary NAAQS for PM&hyph;10; (2) the amended regulations are clearly enforceable;
and (3) the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 51 have been met. A more detailed evaluation is provided in the Technical
Support Document available upon request from the Regional EPA office listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. These revisions to Maryland's regulations have been effective in the State
since March 21, 1989. This action will be effective April 25, 1994 unless, by March 28, 1994, notice is received that
adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the
effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and
another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no
such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on April 25, 1994.

Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the five (5) regulations submitted by the Maryland Department of the Environment as a revision to
the Maryland SIP. EPA's review of this material indicates that it conforms to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 51 and
52, and to the July 1, 1987 promulgation of NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved State implementation plan for conformance
with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action
conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities
affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.

This SIP revision establishing revised particulate matter standards in Maryland has been classified as a Table 3
action for signature by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by April 25, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act.)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The fishery for coastal migratory pelagic fish (king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, cero, cobia, little tunny, dolphin,
and, in the Gulf of Mexico only, bluefish) is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic
Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic
Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 642, under the authority
of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An adjusted allocation and commercial trip limits were recommended by the Councils and implemented by NMFS for Atlantic
migratory group Spanish mackerel for the current fishing year April 1, 1993, through March 31, 1994 (58 FR 45847, August
31, 1993). As set forth at 50 CFR 642.27(b), the adjusted allocation is 4.25 million pounds (1.93 million kg). In accordance
with 50 CFR 642.27(a)(2)(iv), after 100 percent of the adjusted allocation of Atlantic group Spanish mackerel is
taken, Spanish mackerel in or from the EEZ in the southern zone may not be possessed aboard or landed from a vessel in
amounts exceeding 500 pounds (227 kg) per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has determined that 100 percent of the adjusted allocation for Atlantic group Spanish mackerel from the southern
zone was taken by February 17, 1994. Accordingly, the 500-pound (227-kg) per day commercial trip limit applies to
Spanish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mackerel in or from the EEZ in the southern zone effective 12:01 a.m., local time, February 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The first quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 63 is 14,000 metric tons (mt), determined in accordance
with &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iv). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has determined, in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii), that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994 first quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 63 soon will be reached. The Regional Director established
a directed fishing allowance of 13,500 mt, and has set aside the remaining 500 mt as bycatch to support other anticipated
groundfish fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached.
Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 63, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t.,
February 18, 1994, until the second quarter's allowance becomes available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts

620 and 675.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(7)(ii), the first seasonal allowance of pollock for vessels catching pollock
for processing by the offshore component in the BS was established by the final groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656,
February 16, 1994), as 330,671 metric tons (mt). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director) has determined in accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(8),
that the first allowance of pollock TAC for the offshore component in the BS soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional
Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 320,671 mt with consideration that 10,000 mt will be taken
as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the BS. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing
for pollock by vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the BS, effective from 12 noon
A.l.t., February 18, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., August 15, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be

 NMFS issues a technical amendment to the 1994 Pacific cod specifications authorized under Amendment 24 to the Fishery
Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI) and published
with the final rule implementing this amendment. This technical amendment is necessary to clarify a table that sets
forth the 1994 seasonal apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) allocated to vessels
using hook-and-line or pot gear. It is intended to promote management and conservation of groundfish and other fish
resources and to further the goals and objectives contained in the FMP.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final rule implementing Amendment 24 to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI also specified 1994 seasonal
apportionments of the amount of the 1994 Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear (59 FR
4009, January 28, 1994). These specifications were established in Table 2 of the preamble to the final rule at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
59 FR 4011. This technical amendment clarifies Table 2 by adding a footnote that sets forth the intent of the North Pacific
Fishery Management Council to redistribute any unused portions of the first seasonal apportionment to the third
season. This intent is set forth in the preamble to the proposed rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 27, 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 57803) but inadvertently omitted in the final rule of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4009). (See page 57805 in the first
column in the first paragraph.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this technical amendment makes only minor, non-substantive changes to existing regulations, notice and
public comment thereon and a delay in the effective date would serve no purpose. This rule clarifies the intent of the
Council with respect to the seasonal apportionments of the amount of the 1994 Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels
using hook-and-line or pot gear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is not subject to review under E.O. 12866.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would revise the regulations governing inspection and certification for fresh fruits, vegetables
and other products by revising the fees charged for the inspection of these products at destination markets and by
clarifying other charge-related regulations. The proposed fee increases are needed to offset the costs of developing
and maintaining U.S. grade standards for fresh fruits and vegetables and to recover the costs of providing Federal
fruit and vegetable inspection service at destination markets. Regulations regarding fees for inspection of small
lots (fifty packages or less) would be added to provide a fee commensurate with the level of effort typically required
to conduct such inspections. Finally, regulations regarding charges for waiting time would be added and conditions
governing the applicability of dock-side inspection fees would be clarified.

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior
to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.), the Administrator
of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has determined that this action would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule for the revision of the Regulations governing
inspection, certification and standards for fresh fruits, vegetables and other products will not impose substantial
direct economic cost, recordkeeping, or personnel workload changes on small entities, and will not alter the market
share or competitive position of these entities relative to large businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations were last revised in November 1992. The proposed rule reflects fees needed to offset the cost of developing
and maintaining U.S. grade standards for fresh fruits and vegetables previously funded through an appropriation
and to recover the costs of Federal fruit and vegetable inspection service at destination markets rendered in accordance
with the AMA of 1946. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Agriculture Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 1994, Congress directed AMS to establish a user fee program,
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9701, to recover the cost of developing, reviewing, and maintaining agricultural commodity
standards that describe product quality attributes. This proposal would amend the schedule for fees and charges
for services rendered to users at destination markets to recover the portion of the cost for fresh fruit and vegetable
standardization that is applicable to these users.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AMA authorizes voluntary official inspection, grading, and certification on a user-fee basis, of fresh fruits,
vegetables, and other products such as raw nuts, Christmas trees, and flowers. The AMA provides that reasonable fees
be collected from the user of the program services to cover as nearly as practicable the costs of services rendered.
The program seeks to maintain an unobligated balance that is at least equal to 4 months of operating expense. The unobligated
balance for the Federal inspection service at destination markets at the end of fiscal year 1993 was 1.1 months of operating
expense. Approximately $240,000 in increases are expected in the cost the service pays for General Services Administration
office rent and Federal Telecommunications Service, and a $120,000 increase is expected for the cost of implementing
a locality-based pay system in January 1994. The service plans to implement cost-cutting actions during fiscal year
1994 that are expected to save approximately $350,000 each fiscal year beginning in fiscal year 1995. These cost-cutting
actions will offset some of the expected increases in service costs; however, further action is necessary to meet
all rising costs and for the program's unobligated balance to grow to the 4 month level necessary to provide contingency
funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AMS regularly reviews this program to determine if fees are adequate. The last fee change was effective on November
12, 1992 (57 FR 48929). With the planned cost-cutting actions, but without a fee increase, the unobligated balance
of this program is expected to decrease to seven-tenths of a month by the end of fiscal year 1994 and to two-tenths of
a month by the end of fiscal year 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the program's need to offset various rising expenses, to increase its unobligated balance, and to incorporate
user-fee funding for standardization activities, AMS proposes to increase the fees for destination market inspection
services. Additionally, regulations would be added or clarified to (1) establish a new inspection fee for 50 packages
or less of the same product; (2) reflect the lower level of effort typically required to inspect small lots compared
to that required for half carlot equivalent lots with 500 to 1,000 packages; (3) charge for waiting time at the prevailing
hourly rate when an inspection is delayed because product is not available or readily accessible; and (4) apply dock-side
inspection fees to cases where the applicant offers the product to AMS for inspection at the dock-side facility but
AMS chooses to inspect the product at another location.

The following table compares current fees and charges with proposed fees and charges for fresh fruit and vegetable
inspection as found in 7 CFR 51.38. Unless otherwise provided for by regulation or written agreement between the applicant
and the Administrator, the charges in the schedule of fees as found in &sect;51.38 are:

(4) When inspections are performed to certify product compliance for Defense Personnel Support Centers, the daily
or weekly charge shall be determined by multiplying the total hours consumed to conduct inspections by the hourly
rate. The daily or weekly charge shall be prorated among applicants by multiplying the daily or weekly charge by the
percentage of product passed and/or failed for each applicant during that day or week. Waiting time and overtime charges
shall be charged directly to the applicant responsible for their incurrence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When performing inspections at the request of the applicant during periods which are outside the grader's regularly
scheduled work week, a charge for overtime or holiday work shall be made at the rate of $18.50 per hour or portion thereof
in addition to the carlot equivalent fee, package charge, or hourly charge specified in this subpart. Overtime or
holiday charges for time shall be rounded to the nearest half hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an inspection is delayed because product is not available or readily accessible, a charge for waiting time
shall be made at the prevailing hourly rate in addition to the carlot equivalent fee, package charge, or hourly charge

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document invites written comments on a proposal to either terminate or for 1994 suspend the seasonal incentive
plans for paying producers under the New England and New York-New Jersey Federal milk orders. This was requested by
cooperative associations that represent about one-half of the milk supply for each market. The cooperatives contend
that the payment plans, which have been suspended since 1991, are no longer effective in altering producer seasonal
milk production patterns.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to
5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that the proposed actions
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Such actions would lessen
the regulatory impact of the order on dairy farmers and would have no impact on regulated handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, the termination,
or as an alternative the suspension for the months of March through June 1994 and August through November 1994, of the
following provisions of the order regulating the handling of milk in the New England and New York-New Jersey marketing
areas are being considered: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. In &sect;1001.62, paragraphs (c) and (d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In &sect;1002.61, paragraphs (d) and (e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All persons who want to send written data, views, or arguments about the proposed termination or suspension of provisions
should send two copies of them to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building,
P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, not later than 30 days after the publication of this notice in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The period for filing comments is limited to 15 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete
the required procedures before the requested termination or suspension is to be effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments that are received will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during normal business
hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).

Statement of Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed actions would either terminate, or as an alternative suspend for the months of March through June 1994
and August through November 1994, the seasonal incentive plans for paying producers under the New England and New
York-New Jersey Federal milk orders. The seasonal payment plans provide for making deductions from prices paid to
producers during the normal flush-production months of March through June. The deducted amounts are returned to
producers during the normal short-production months of August through November. The plan is intended to provide
an incentive for dairy farmers to level out the seasonal milk production pattern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actions were requested by several cooperative associations representing dairy farmers who supply handlers
regulated by the Federal milk marketing orders for the New England and New York-New Jersey marketing areas. Collectively,
these cooperatives represent about 51 percent of the producers associated with the New England marketing area and
about 48 percent of the producers associated with the New York-New Jersey marketing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cooperatives maintain that the ``Louisville'' seasonal payment plans have not had the effect of reducing the
large seasonal spring-to-fall swings in milk production as was intended when they were first provided for in these
orders some 25 years ago. They maintain that the seasonality of milk production in the Northeast has not been reduced
significantly. The cooperatives assert that the seasonal payment plans are largely ineffective because of a general
lack of awareness about the plan in the dairy farming community. They also contend that the price differentials are
too low to provide an incentive for dairy farmers to modify their seasonal production patterns. The cooperatives
also expressed concern about the impact of reducing returns to producers during the spring months when producer milk
prices are already generally lower than during other times of the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The cooperatives seeking actions noted that the seasonal incentive payment plans have been repeatedly suspended
since 1991. They contend that the prior suspension actions are further evidence that the plans are no longer necessary
or effective. These past suspensions, according to the cooperatives, were supported by the need for dairy farmers
to have additional monies available during the spring months in which prices to producers declined precipitously.
The cooperatives expect that milk prices will decline in the spring of 1994, which will continue to put a cash flow pressure
on dairy farmers during a time of increased cash needs for spring planting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, comments are sought to determine whether the aforementioned provisions should be terminated or, in the
alternative, suspended for the months of March through June 1994 and August through November 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A hearing held in February 1993 to consider proposals to adopt multiple component pricing for milk pooled under the
Southern Michigan marketing order is being reopened to consider modifications to the pricing plan recommended for
that order. Additional proposals would authorize the market administrator to adjust pool supply plant shipping
requirements to reflect changes in marketing conditions. The reopened hearing will also consider a proposal to ``lock
in'' to regulation under the Southern Michigan order a UHT packaging plant that otherwise may be regulated under a
different Federal order each month. A request to consider the ``lock in'' proposal on an emergency basis also will
be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reopening was requested by cooperative associations representing most of the producers whose milk is pooled

Notice is hereby given of a reopened public hearing to be held at the request of most of the producers whose milk is pooled
under the Southern Michigan milk order. The reopened hearing will begin at 9 a.m. on March 1, 1994, at the Radisson Hotel,
11 Monroe Avenue NW., Grand Rapids, Michigan 49503, telephone (616) 242&hyph;6000, with respect to proposed amendments
to the tentative marketing agreement and to the order regulating the handling of milk in the Southern Michigan marketing
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7
U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing
agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part 900). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence with respect to the economic and marketing conditions which relate
to the proposed amendments, hereinafter set forth, and any appropriate modifications thereof, to the tentative
marketing agreement and to the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evidence also will be taken to determine whether emergency marketing conditions exist that would warrant omission
of a recommended decision under the rules of practice and procedure (7 CFR 900.12(d)) with respect to Proposal No.
3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Actions under the Federal milk order program are subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354).
This Act seeks to ensure that, within the statutory authority of a program, the regulatory and informational requirements
are tailored to the size and nature of small businesses. For the purpose of the Act, a dairy farm is a ``small business''
if it has an annual gross revenue of less than $500,000, and a dairy products manufacturer is a ``small business'' if
it has fewer than 500 employees. Most parties subject to a milk order are considered as a small business. Accordingly,
interested parties are invited to present evidence on the probable regulatory and informational impact of the hearing
proposals on small businesses. Also, parties may suggest modifications of these proposals for the purpose of tailoring
their applicability to small business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.
They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with these rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties
may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary
a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order
is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler
is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition.
The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant,
or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition,
provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
747 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion
of the skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. This proposal would also require modification
of certain lap joints and inspections of modified lap joints. This proposal is prompted by a structural review of Model
747 series airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent rapid decompression of the
airplane and the inability to carry fail-safe loads.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1988, a transport category airplane managed to land after tiny cracks in rivet holes in the upper fuselage
linked together, causing structural failure and explosive decompression. An 18-foot section ripped from the fuselage.
This accident focused greater attention on the problem of aging aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1988, the FAA sponsored a conference on aging airplane issues, which was attended by representatives of the
aviation industry from around the world. It became obvious that, because of the tremendous increase in air travel,
the relatively slow pace of new airplane production, and the apparent economic feasibility of operating older technology
airplanes rather than retiring them, increased attention needed to be focused on this aging fleet and maintaining
its continued operational safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America and the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America committed
to identifying and implementing procedures to ensure continuing structural airworthiness of aging transport category
airplanes. An Airworthiness Assurance Task Force, with representatives from the aircraft operators, manufacturers,
regulatory authorities, and other aviation representatives, was established in August 1988. The objective of the
Task Force was to sponsor ``Working Groups'' to (1) select service bulletins, applicable to each airplane model in
the transport fleet, to be recommended for mandatory modification of aging airplanes, (2) develop corrosion directed
inspections and prevention programs, and (3) review the adequacy of each operator's structural maintenance program,
(4) review and update the Supplemental Structural Inspection Documents (SSID), and (5) assess repair quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group assigned to review the Boeing Model 747 series airplanes completed its work on Item (2) in July 1989
and developed a baseline program for controlling corrosion problems that may jeopardize the continued airworthiness
of the Boeing Model 747 fleet. This program is contained in Boeing Document Number D6&hyph;36022, ``Aging Airplane
Corrosion Prevention and Control Program_Model 747,'' dated July 1989. The FAA issued AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05, Amendment
39&hyph;6790 (55 FR 49268, November 27, 1990), which requires implementation of a corrosion prevention and control
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group completed a portion of its work on Item (1), above. The Working Group's proposal is contained in Boeing
Document Number D6&hyph;35999, ``Aging Airplane Service Bulletin Structural Modification Program_Model 747.''
The FAA issued AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;6490 (55 FR 8374, March 7, 1990), which requires the installation
of the structural modifications identified in the document, and AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;8437
(58 FR 8695, February 17, 1993), which requires structural inspections of older airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional structural inspections are required by AD 90&hyph;15&hyph;06, Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39&hyph;6653 (55 FR 28600, July 12, 1990), which references Boeing Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
747&hyph;53&hyph;2307, dated December 21, 1989. (A correction of the rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 30, 1990 (55 FR 31027).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The action being proposed herein follows from the ongoing activities of the Working Group relative to Item (1). The
Working Group has identified certain service difficulties that warrant mandatory inspections following mandatory
modification of these airplanes. The Working Group considers that these service difficulties can be controlled
safely by repetitively inspecting following modification of these airplanes, and that, because of the safety implications,
the inspections should be mandatory to assure that all operators perform them. Typically, the addressed unsafe conditions
have occurred infrequently on older airplanes, and the Working Group has a very high degree of confidence in the ability
of an inspection program to detect the damage before it impairs safety.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Working Group has reviewed Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2307, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revision 2, dated October 14, 1993, and has recommended it to the FAA for mandating of the described inspections to
detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and necessary
repair. The SWG also recommends modification of certain skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe that are fastened
with deep countersink rivets on airplanes that have accumulated 20,000 or more total landings. The upper skin panel
in these particular lap joints has a doubler that is hot-bonded to the skin. The countersink depth of the rivet is greater
than the basic skin gage. While this is not a problem for a skin panel with the hot bond intact, disbonding will result
in a knife-edge condition in the skin layer. This condition causes these lap joints to be more susceptible to fatigue-related
cracking. The SWG also recommends accomplishment of repetitive inspections of these modified lap joints. Accomplishment
of these modifications and inspections will detect fatigue-related cracking and corrosion in a timely manner and
will ensure the structural integrity of the skin lap joints beyond the design life of the airplane. The FAA has concurred
with the Working Group's recommendations and has determined that AD action is warranted to mandate the inspections
and modifications to assure the continued airworthiness of the Model 747 fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2307, Revision 2, dated October 14,
1993, that describes procedures for inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin
lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The service bulletin also describes procedures for ``full'' modification of certain skin lap joints in the fuselage
upper lobe that are fastened with deep countersink rivets on airplanes that have accumulated 20,000 total landings.
Such rivets are used in the lap joints at the following locations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Stringer 12, left and right, from station 520 to 1,000; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Stringer 19, left and right, from station 520 to 740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``full'' modification for deep countersink rivets at these locations consists of opening the lap joint between
circumferential splices, removing adhesive, repairing all cracks and corrosion, and reassembling the lap joint
with 9/32 inch protruding head rivets at all rivet locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The service bulletin also describes procedures for repetitive external high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections
to detect fatigue-related skin cracks of modified lap joints at the upper fastener row, and repair, if necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The service bulletin also describes procedures for an ``optional'' (partial) modification for certain lap joint
areas that have an upper skin panel thickness of 0.090 inch or less and that do not have cracks or corrosion or an existing
structural repair on the lap joint. The ``optional'' (partial) modification consists of removing the upper row of
rivets at a corrosion-free lap joint, performing an HFEC open hole inspection to detect cracks in removed rivet locations,
and installing 1/4-inch protruding head rivets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin
lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. The proposed AD would also require ``full'' modification
of certain skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe that are fastened with deep countersink rivets on airplanes that
have accumulated 20,000 total landings. The inspections and ``full modification'' would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed AD would also require repetitive external HFEC inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks of
modified lap joints, and repair, if necessary. After such repair, additional repetitive external HFEC inspections
would be required. The HFEC inspections and repair would also be required to be accomplished in accordance with the
service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed AD would also provide an ``optional'' (partial) modification for certain skin panels that have a thickness
that is within specified limits, and that do not have cracks or corrosion or an existing structural repair on the lap
joint. For those skin panels, this ``optional'' (partial) modification may be accomplished in lieu of the ``full''
modification. However, the ``optional'' (partial) modification may not be implemented at deep countersink fastener
locations. The ``optional'' (partial) modification would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the
service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accomplishment of the requirements of this proposed AD would terminate the requirements of AD 90&hyph;15&hyph;06,
Amendment 39&hyph;6653 (55 FR 28600, July 12, 1990). The FAA is considering further rulemaking action to revise AD
90&hyph;15&hyph;06, Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39&hyph;6653, accordingly once this proposed AD becomes effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 200 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 116 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with the proposed inspections entail 100 work hours per airplane per inspection, at an average
labor rate of $55 per work hour. (This figure does not include the time necessary for gaining access and closing up.)
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators, with regard to the proposed inspections,
is estimated to be $638,000, or $5,500 per airplane per inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with the proposed ``full'' modification entail approximately 96 work hours, for each 200-inch
length of uncracked and uncorroded lap joint, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. (This figure does not include
the time necessary for gaining access and closing up.) There are 100 lap joint sections per airplane, each with a length
of 200 inches. The cost of required parts is expected to be negligible. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the proposed AD on U.S. operators, with regard to the proposed ``full'' modification requirement, is estimated
to be $61,248,000, or $528,000 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with the proposed initial HFEC inspection following modification entails approximately 56
work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators, with regard to the proposed initial HFEC inspection following modification, is estimated to
be $357,280, or $3,080 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is expected to be
$62,243,280, or $536,580 per airplane. This total cost figure includes the proposed inspections and modification,
for the first year of the average five-year inspection cycle. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet
accomplished the proposed requirements of this proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the proposed ``full'' modification would require a large number of work hours to accomplish.
However, the proposed compliance time specified in paragraph (e) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for accomplishment
of the ``full'' modification coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities,
thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have applied to certain British Aerospace
(BAe), Regional Aircraft Limited, HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes. The proposed action
would have required identifying all Type ``F'' universal joints on the flap torque shaft and replacing these universal
joints with Type ``M'' or Type ``MC'' universal joints. Since issuance of the NPRM, Jetstream Aircraft Ltd. has introduced
improved flap torque shaft assemblies that include universal joints that are not life limited, and that incorporate
the actions proposed in the referenced NPRM and required in two other existing airworthiness directives (AD's).
The FAA has determined that installing these improved assemblies would incorporate the actions of the current NPRM
and the requirements of the two existing AD's. The FAA is withdrawing the current NPRM and will subsequently issue
another NPRM that would incorporate all the actions referenced above.

Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposed rule or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), Jetstream Aircraft Ltd. has introduced improved flap
torque shaft assemblies that include universal joints that are not life limited, and that incorporate the actions
proposed in the referenced NPRM and required in two other existing AD's. The FAA has determined that installing these
improved assemblies would incorporate the actions proposed in the current NPRM and the requirements of the following
AD's:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;5529, which requires limiting the in-service life of the torque
tube shaft assembly on BAe HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02, Amendment 39&hyph;6273, which requires repetitively inspecting the universal
joints and universal joint rivets on BAe HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes, and replacing
any damaged part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA will issue another NPRM to propose combining the universal joint inspection requirements and the flap torque
shaft assembly life limit requirement of the two existing AD's, but mandate installing improved flap torque shaft
assemblies as terminating action for these requirements. Since this future action will also incorporate the previously
proposed actions, the FAA is withdrawing the existing NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Withdrawal of this NPRM constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from issuing another notice
in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action only withdraws an NPRM, it is neither a proposed rule nor a final rule and therefore, is not covered
under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,
February 26, 1979).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to certain Piper Aircraft Corporation
(Piper) PA28R, PA28RT, and PA44 series airplanes. The proposed action would require installing a certain nose landing
gear modification kit. Several service difficulty reports of collapsed nosegear on the affected airplanes prompted
this action. In particular, these reports reveal failure of the bolt (AN4&hyph;20) connecting the lower drag link
of the nosegear to the upper drag link. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent nose gear collapse
because of AN4&hyph;20 bolt failure, which could lead to airplane damage.

Discussion

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has received several service difficulty reports of collapsed nosegear on certain Piper PA28R, PA28RT, and
PA44 series airplanes. In particular, these reports reveal failure of the bolt (AN4&hyph;20) connecting the lower
drag link of the nosegear to the upper drag link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the nose landing gear of a Piper Model PA44&hyph;180 airplane collapsed during the landing roll. The
accident occurred during a normal touchdown and was a result of AN4&hyph;20 bolt failure. Both the left and right propellers
struck the ground and were damaged beyond repair.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Piper Service Letter No. 988, dated July 29, 1986, references Nose Landing Gear Modification Kit, Piper part number
(P/N) 764&hyph;377 (for PA28R and PA28RT series airplanes) and Piper P/N 764&hyph;378 (for PA44 series airplanes).
The modification kits consist of a close tolerance bolt (NAS464P4&hyph;27), four bearings, and all other associated
hardware for installation on the draglink assembly. This NAS464P4&hyph;27 bolt replaces the AN4&hyph;20 bolt used
to connect the upper and lower draglinks. Instructions to these kits specify complete installation procedures for
these parts, including a check of the nosegear downlock hook to ensure that it rotates freely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the accident and incidents
described above, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent nose gear collapse because of failure
of the AN4&hyph;20 bolt, which could lead to airplane damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Piper PA28R, PA28RT, and PA44
series airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require installing Nose Landing Gear Modification
Kit, Piper part number (P/N) 764&hyph;377 (for PA28R and PA28RT series airplanes) or Piper P/N 764&hyph;378 (for
PA44 series airplanes). The proposed action would be accomplished in accordance with the instructions included
with the referenced kits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 6,888 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take
approximately 6 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately
$55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $52 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,631,216. This figure is based on the assumption that none of the affected
airplane owners/operators have accomplished the proposed modification.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 5, 1993, the Coast Guard published an NPRM regarding the establishment of a vessel identification system
(VIS) (58 FR 51920). The VIS proposal would establish a vessel identification system, as required by legislation,
guidelines for State vessel titling systems, procedures for certifying compliance with those guidelines, and rules
for participation in the VIS system for undocumented vessels. The Coast Guard has received a request to extend the
comment period for six months. The Coast Guard has determined that in order to keep this important project moving in
as timely a manner as possible, extending the comment period for six months would be inappropriate. However, the Coast
Guard recognizes the value of data and information from interested parties. Therefore, the Coast Guard, in order
to encourage meaningful participation by all interested parties, is reopening the comment period for an additional
30 days.

VA proposes to amend its regulations to provide for the guarantee of loans for reservists and members of the national
guard, loans where the interest rate has been negotiated between the borrower and the lender, adjustable rate mortgages,
and energy efficient mortgages. VA also proposes to amend its regulations to reflect a reduced funding fee for interest
rate reduction refinancing loans, and a revised guaranty percentage for these loans as well as an increased funding
fee on most guaranteed loans, and an increased funding fee for second and subsequent use of the loan guaranty benefit,
except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans. These changes will increase the types of loans available to
veterans and the categories of veterans eligible for VA home loans.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 VA is proposing to incorporate into its regulations several changes to comply with certain provisions of Public Law
102&hyph;547 and Public Law 103&hyph;66. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the enactment of Public Law 102&hyph;547 persons whose only military service consisted of active duty for
training and inactive duty training in the reserve components of the Armed Forces did not qualify for loan guaranty
benefits. Public Law 102&hyph;547 extends eligibility for VA-guaranteed home loans to certain members of the Selected
Reserve as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5). This eligibility expires 7 years from the date of enactment of the law.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38 U.S.C. 3729 requires that a funding fee be collected from each veteran obtaining a VA-guaranteed loan except for
veterans who receive compensation or from a surviving spouse of a veteran who died from a service-connected disability.
Public Law 102&hyph;547 requires that a higher funding fee be collected on loans to the newly eligible members of the
Selected Reserve as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5) than on loans to other veterans. Effective October 1, 1993, Public
Law 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, increased the funding fee by 0.75 percent on all VA
loans except interest rate reduction refinancing loans, vendee loans, direct loans, manufactured home loans under
38 U.S.C. 3712, and loan assumptions. This new law also established an increased fee for second and subsequent use
of the loan guaranty benefit, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans. The increase in funding fees
established by Public Law 103&hyph;66 will expire on September 30, 1998. VA is proposing to amend 38 CFR 36.4312 to
add the funding fee structure for members of the Selected Reserves, and to provide for the higher funding fees required
by Public Law 103&hyph;66, as discussed in the following paragraphs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;66 provides that on loans to veterans whose entitlement is not based on service in the Selected
Reserve as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3701 (b)(5)(1), the funding fee shall be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For loans for the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, the funding
fee shall be 2.00 percent of the total loan amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For loans where the veteran makes a down payment of 5 percent or more, but less than 10 percent, the funding fee shall
be 1.5 percent of the loan amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For loans where the veteran makes a down payment of 10 percent or more, the funding fee shall be 1.25 percent of the
total loan amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For refinancing loans except interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) and 3710(b)(7),
the funding fee shall be 2.00 percent of the total loan amount; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) For loans where the veteran uses entitlement for a second or subsequent time and does not make a downpayment, the
funding fee shall be 3.00 percent of the total loan amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;66 provides that on loans to veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve
as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5) the funding fee shall be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For loans for the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, the funding
fee shall be 2.75 percent of the total loan amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For loans where the veteran makes a down payment of 5 percent or more, but less than 10 percent, the funding fee shall
be 2.25 percent of the loan amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For loans where the veteran makes a down payment of 10 percent or more, the funding fee shall be 2.00 percent of the
total loan amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For refinancing loans except interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) and 3710(b)(7),
the funding fee shall be 2.75 percent of the total loan amount; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) For loans where the veteran uses entitlement for a second or subsequent time and does not make a downpayment, the
funding fee shall be 3.00 percent of the total loan amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the enactment of Public Law 102&hyph;547 the Secretary was required to set a maximum interest rate which a
veteran could pay when purchasing a home with a VA guaranteed loan, and the veteran was not permitted to pay discount
points on the loan. Public Law 102&hyph;547 authorizes the Secretary to elect either to require that VA-guaranteed
loans bear interest at rates not to exceed the maximum rates established by the Secretary or to allow such loans to bear
interest at rates agreed upon by the veteran and the lender. The law also authorizes the Secretary to change the election
from time to time, and provides that when the Secretary has elected to have interest rates negotiated between the veteran
and the lender, the veteran may pay reasonable discount points on the loan. Effective October 28, 1992, the Secretary
elected to have interest rates negotiated between the veteran and the lender. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4212 and
36.4311 to reflect these changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 102&hyph;547 generally prohibits financing discount points when interest rates are negotiated between
the lender and veteran. However, Public Law 103&hyph;78, approved August 13, 1993, permits veterans to finance discount
points on interest rate reduction refinancing loans. Accordingly, the proposed &sect;&sect;36.4212(b) and 36.4311(b)
prohibit discount points from being financed, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C.
3710(a)(8), 3710(b)(7) and 3712(a)(1)(F). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to enactment of Public Law 102&hyph;547, VA was authorized to guarantee fixed rate mortgages only. Public Law
102&hyph;547 authorizes a demonstration project during fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995 whereby VA will guarantee
loans with adjustable interest rates. The law provides that the interest rate adjustments on these loans shall: (1)
Correspond to a specified national interest rate index approved in regulations by the Secretary, information on
which is readily accessible to mortgagors from generally available published sources; (2) be made by adjusting the
monthly payment on an annual basis; (3) be limited, with respect to any single annual interest rate adjustment, to
a maximum increase or decrease of 1 percentage point; and (4) be limited, over the term of the mortgage, to a maximum
increase of 5 percentage points above the initial contract interest rate. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4311 to provide
for an adjustable rate mortgage with these adjustment provisions. The regulations will also provide that the first
interest rate adjustment may occur 12 to 18 months from the date of the borrower's first mortgage payment. The VA guaranteed
adjustable rate mortgage with the above features will be similar to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) adjustable
rate mortgage. This should facilitate pooling of these mortgages together in Government National Mortgage Association
(GNMA) mortgage-backed securities pools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;547 requires the Secretary to carry out a program to demonstrate the feasibility of guaranteeing
mortgages for the acquisition of an existing dwelling and the cost of making energy efficiency improvements to the
dwelling or for energy efficient improvements to a dwelling owned and occupied by a veteran. The law authorizes an
addition to the purchase loan for the cost of energy efficient improvements. It provides that for a mortgage guaranteed
under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d) the cost of the energy efficient improvements may be added to the loan amount provided the cost
does not exceed (1) $3,000; or (2) $6,000, if the increase in the monthly payment for principal and interest does not
exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs resulting from the energy efficiency improvements. VA proposes
to amend 38 CFR 36.4336 to provide that a loan for an energy efficient mortgage guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d) may
exceed the reasonable value of the property by the cost of the energy efficient improvements as stated above. This
demonstration program for financing the cost of energy efficiency improvements will expire on December 31, 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The law provides that the amount of the guaranty for an energy efficient mortgage guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d)
will be in the same proportion as would have been provided if the energy efficiency improvements were not added to the
loan amount. It also provides that there be no additional charge to the veteran's entitlement as a result of the increased
loan amount. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4302 to conform to these changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;547 reduces the funding fee for interest rate reduction refinancing loans guaranteed under
sections 3710(a)(8), 3710(a)(9)(B), and 3712(a)(1)(F) to 0.50 percent of the total loan amount. VA proposes to amend
38 CFR 36.4232, 36.4254 and 36.4312 to comply with the law. The law also provides that the guaranty amount for interest
rate reduction refinancing loans shall not exceed the greater of the original guaranty amount or 25 percent of the
loan amount. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4223 and 36.4302 to reflect this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of Public Law 102&hyph;547 and Public Law 103&hyph;66 included in the appropriate regulations by
this amendment have been implemented administratively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary hereby certifies that these proposed regulatory amendments will not, if promulgated, have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5
U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The proposed amendments simply update VA regulations to incorporate the changes which have
already been made by Public Law 102&hyph;547 and Public Law 103&hyph;66.

(a) In guaranteeing or insuring loans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 the Secretary may elect to require that such loans
bear interest at a rate that is (1) agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, or (2) established by the Secretary. The
Secretary may, from time to time, change the election under this paragraph by publishing a notice in the

. Changes in the interest rate charged on an adjustable rate mortgage must correspond to changes in the weekly average
yield on one year (52 week) Treasury bills adjusted to a constant maturity. Yields on one year Treasury bills at `constant
maturity' are interpolated by the United States Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve, which relates the
yield on the security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded one year Treasury
bills in the over-the-counter market. The weekly average one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are published
by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Statistical Release Report H.15 (519)
is released each Monday. These one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are also published monthly in the Federal
Reserve Bulletin, published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System, as well as quarterly in the
Treasury Bulletin, published by the Department of the Treasury.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interest rate adjustments must occur on an annual basis, except that the first adjustment may occur not sooner than
12 months nor later than 18 months from the date of the borrower's first mortgage payment. To set the new interest rate,
the lender will determine the change between the initial (i.e., base) index figure and the current index figure. The
initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of mortgage loan origination. The current
index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment.

Initial rate and magnitude of changes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial contract interest rate of an adjustable rate mortgage shall be agreed upon by the lender and the veteran.
The rate must be reflective of adjustable rate lending. Annual adjustments in the interest rate shall be set at a certain
spread or margin over the interest rate index prescribed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Except for the initial
rate, this margin shall remain constant over the life of the loan. Annual adjustments to the contract interest rate
shall correspond to annual changes in the interest rate index, subject to the following conditions and limitations:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No single adjustment to the interest rate may result in a change in either direction of more than one percentage
point from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess
of one percentage point may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment in a subsequent year. Adjustments in
the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of
more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) At each adjustment date, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated
into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent, up or down. For example,
if the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.06 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8 percent.
If the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.07 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 81/8
percent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pre-loan disclosure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The lender shall explain fully and in writing to the borrower, no later than on the date upon which the lender provides
the prospective borrower with a loan application, the nature of the obligation taken. The borrower shall certify
in writing that he or she fully understands the obligation and a copy of the signed certification shall be placed in
the loan folder and included in the loan submission to VA. Such lender disclosure must include the following items:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The fact that the mortgage interest rate may change, and an explanation of how changes correspond to changes in
the interest rate index;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Identification of the interest rate index, its source of publication and availability; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The frequency (i.e., annually) with which interest rate levels and monthly payments will be adjusted, and the
length of the interval that will precede the initial adjustment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A hypothetical monthly payment schedule that displays the maximum potential increases in monthly payments
to the borrower over the first five years of the mortgage, subject to the provisions of the mortgage instrument. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annual disclosure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At least 25 days before any adjustment to a borrower's monthly payment may occur, the lender must provide a notice to
the borrower which sets forth the date of the notice, the effective date of the change, the old interest rate, the new
interest rate, the new monthly payment amount, the current index and the date it was published, and a description of
how the payment adjustment was calculated. A copy of the annual disclosure shall be made a part of the lender's permanent
record on the loan.

(e)(1) Subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (e)(4) and (e)(5) of this section, a fee must be paid to the Secretary.
A fee of 1 percent of the total amount must be paid in a manner prescribed by the Secretary before a manufactured home
unit loan will be eligible for guaranty. Provided, however, that the fee shall be 0.50 percent of the total loan amount
for interest rate reduction refinancing loans guaranteed under section 3712(a)(1)(F). All or part of the fee may
be paid in cash at loan closing or all or part of the fee may be included in the loan without regard to the reasonable value
of the property or the computed maximum loan amount, as appropriate. In computing the fee, the lender will disregard
any amount included in the loan to enable the borrower to pay such fee.

use of entitlement:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If a veteran previously secured a nonrealty (business) loan, the amount of nonrealty entitlement used is doubled
and subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use except that (i) entitlement
may be increased by up to $10,000 if the loan amount exceeds $144,000 and the loan is for purchase or construction of
a home, purchase of a condominium, or for an interest rate reduction refinancing loan, and (ii) entitlement for manufactured
home loans that are to be guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712 may not exceed $20,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In guaranteeing or insuring loans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 the Secretary may elect to require that such loans
bear interest at a rate that is (1) agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, or (2) established by the Secretary. The
Secretary may, from time to time, change the election under this paragraph by publishing a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Provided, however, that the interest rate of loans for the purpose of an interest rate reduction (38 U.S.C. 3710 (a)(8)
or (b)(7)) must be less than the interest rate of the VA loan being refinanced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For loans bearing an interest rate agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, the veteran may pay reasonable discount
points in connection with the loan. The discount points may not be included in the loan amount, except for interest
rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) and 3710(b)(7). For loans bearing an interest rate agreed
upon by the veteran and the lender the provisions of &sect;36.4312, paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) do not apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Interest in excess of the rate reported by the lender when requesting evidence of guaranty or insurance shall not

Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Interest rate index.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Changes in the interest rate charged on an adjustable rate mortgage must correspond to changes in the weekly average
yield on one year (52 week) Treasury bills adjusted to a constant maturity. Yields on one year Treasury bills at `constant
maturity' are interpolated by the United States Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve, which relates the
yield on the security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded one year Treasury
bills in the over-the-counter market. The weekly average one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are published
by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Statistical Release Report H.15 (519)
is released each Monday. These one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are also published monthly in the Federal
Reserve Bulletin, published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System, as well as quarterly in the
Treasury Bulletin, published by the Department of the Treasury.

Frequency of interest rate changes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Interest rate adjustments must occur on an annual basis, except that the first adjustment may occur no sooner than
12 months nor later than 18 months from the date of the borrower's first mortgage payment. To set the new interest rate,
the lender will determine the change between the initial (i.e., base) index figure and the current index figure. The
initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of mortgage loan origination. The current
index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment.

Method of rate changes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Interest rate changes may only be implemented through adjustments to the borrower's monthly payments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Initial rate and magnitude of changes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The initial contract interest rate of an adjustable rate mortgage shall be agreed upon by the lender and the veteran.
The rate must be reflective of adjustable rate lending. Annual adjustments in the interest rate shall be set at a certain
spread or margin over the interest rate index prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Except for the initial
rate, this margin shall remain constant over the life of the loan. Annual adjustments to the contract interest rate
shall correspond to annual changes in the interest rate index, subject to the following conditions and limitations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No single adjustment to the interest rate may result in a change in either direction of more than one percentage
point from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess
of one percentage point may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment in a subsequent year. Adjustments in
the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of
more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) At each adjustment date, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated
into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent, up or down. For example,
if the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.06 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8 percent.
If the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.07 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 81/8
percent.

Pre-loan disclosure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The lender shall explain fully and in writing to the borrower, no later than on the date upon which the lender provides
the prospective borrower with a loan application, the nature of the obligation taken. The borrower shall certify
in writing that he or she fully understands the obligation and a copy of the signed certification shall be placed in
the loan folder and included in the loan submission to VA. Such lender disclosure must include the following items:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The fact that the mortgage interest rate may change, and an explanation of how changes correspond to changes in
the interest rate index:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Identification of the interest rate index, its source of publication and availability;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The frequency (i.e., annually) with which interest rate levels and monthly payments will be adjusted, and the
length of the interval that will precede the initial adjustment;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A hypothetical monthly payment schedule that displays the maximum potential increases in monthly payments
to the borrower over the first five years of the mortgage, subject to the provisions of the mortgage instrument.

(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annual disclosure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At least 25 days before any adjustment to a borrower's monthly payment may occur, the lender must provide a notice to
the borrower which sets forth the date of the notice, the effective date of the change, the old interest rate, the new
interest rate, the new monthly payment amount, the current index and the date it was published, and a description of
how the payment adjustment was calculated. A copy of the annual disclosure shall be made a part of the lender's permanent
record on the loan.

veterans, provided, however, that if the veteran is using entitlement for a second or subsequent time, the fee shall
be 3 percent of the loan amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Except for loans to veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve under the provisions
of section 3701(b)(5) of title 38, U.S.C., the funding fee shall be 2 percent of the total loan amount for all loans for
the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, unless the veteran is using
entitlement for a second or subsequent time, in which case the fee shall be 3 percent. On purchase or construction loans
on which the veteran makes a down payment of 5 percent or more, but less than 10 percent, the amount of the funding fee

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 15, 1992, EPA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for Fuels and Fuel Additives (F/FAs) Registration Regulations (57 FR 13168).
The purpose of the proposed regulation would be to establish requirements for the registration of motor vehicle F/FAs
as authorized by sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Under the proposed regulations, manufacturers
of F/FAs would be required to conduct certain tests and submit information regarding the composition of emissions
produced by such F/FAs and the effects of these emissions on public health and welfare.

EPA held a public hearing on the NPRM on May 28, 1992 and accepted written comments until June 30, 1992. Subsequent analysis
indicated that additional public notice to clarify and reconsider a few specific compliance-related and technical
issues would be helpful in developing the final rule. Today's action presents these issues and requests comments
on EPA's proposals for addressing them. The issues addressed in this document are the following: Timing of requirements
for new F/FAs, alternative testing requirements in lieu of Tier 2, general emission generation methodology, mileage
accumulation for the testing of atypical F/FAs, and base fuel specifications.

The legal authority for the F/FA registration program is provided by section 211 of the CAA. Section 211(a), 42 USC
section 7545, authorizes EPA to designate any fuel or fuel additive for registration and prohibits manufacturers
of designated fuels or additives from selling such products unless they have been registered by EPA in accordance
with section 211(b). In 1975, EPA issued regulations (40 CFR part 79) implementing basic registration requirements,
as stipulated by section 211(b)(1), that required applicants to submit certain information, such as commercial
identifying information, range of concentration, purpose-in-use, and chemical composition, in order to register
a fuel or fuel additive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA also gave EPA discretionary authority to establish additional registration requirements under section
211(b)(2). This section authorized EPA to require F/FA manufacturers ``to conduct tests to determine potential
public health effects of such fuel[s] or additive[s] (including but not limited to, carcinogenic, teratogenic,
or mutagenic effects),'' and to furnish other ``reasonable and necessary'' information to identify F/FA emissions
and determine their effects on vehicular emission control performance and on the public health and welfare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA did not exercise its discretionary authority to require testing of F/FAs under section 211(b)(2) when the general
registration regulations were issued in 1975. However, in the CAA Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95&hyph;95, August
7, 1977), Congress added section 211(e), which made implementation of section 211(b)(2) mandatory. On August 7,
1990, EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) (55 FR 32218) and, on April 15, 1992, published
an NPRM (57 FR 13168) proposing additional registration requirements under sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of the
CAA. The purpose of the rule would be to provide EPA with information for identifying and evaluating the potential
adverse health effects of motor vehicle F/FA emissions and for guiding the direction of related regulatory actions
in the future as specified in section 211(c). The reader is referred to the NPRM and Public Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;07
for detailed information on the proposed registration requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the proposal, a public hearing was held on May 28, 1992, followed by a written comment
period which closed on June 30, 1992. A transcript of the public hearing and the written comments are contained in the
docket.

After careful evaluation of the comments and additional technical analysis, EPA determined that additional public
notice to clarify certain key compliance issues and to modify certain proposed technical approaches would be beneficial.
The next sections of this notice discuss the issues in question and request relevant comments from the public. EPA
asks the public to focus their comments on the key areas discussed below. Comments on topics addressed in previous
notices and comment periods will be treated as late communication to which EPA is not required to respond. The issues
to be addressed are the following: (1) Timing of requirements for new F/FAs, (2) alternative testing requirements
in lieu of Tier 2, (3) general emission generation methodology, (4) mileage accumulation for the testing of atypical
F/FAs, and (5) base fuel specifications.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The registration requirements proposed in the April 1992 NPRM were organized within a three-tiered health effects
evaluation structure. Under Tier 1, F/FA manufacturers would be required to perform a literature search on the health
and welfare effects of 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA emissions, characterize the emissions, and provide exposure information. Tier 2 would include short-term
biological testing to screen for specific health effects endpoints, involving the exposure of laboratory animals
to the whole emissions of fuels or fuel/additive mixtures. After receipt and review of manufacturers' Tier 1 and Tier
2 submittals, EPA would determine, on a case-by-case basis, if additional testing were needed under Tier 3 to evaluate
the risk of a particular F/FA (or group of F/FAs) on human health or welfare. Tier 3 testing could include any emissions
analysis, health effects, welfare effects, and/or exposure testing or analysis deemed necessary by EPA for this
purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The organization of the F/FA program's requirements into hierarchical tiers was proposed, in part, to ensure that
the rule would accommodate the goals of section 211(b) within the time restrictions of section 211(e). Section 211(e)
requires that, for F/FAs registered as of the date of promulgation of the final rule, the ``requisite information''
be submitted to EPA within three years of that date. On the other hand, manufacturers seeking to register F/FA products
after the date of promulgation would have to satisfy the testing requirements before registration would be granted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA judged that compliance with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements should be achievable within the three-year time
limit for registered F/FAs; thus, these two tiers were proposed to be defined as the ``requisite information'' for
registration pursuant to its authority under CAA section 211(e). However, maintenance of such registration would
be conditional on subsequent satisfaction of any Tier 3 requirements which EPA might impose pursuant to its authority
under CAA section 211(b). For consistency, the same definition of ``requisite information'' and the same Tier 3 arrangements
were proposed to apply to both currently registered and new F/FAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to maintain these originally proposed provisions in the case of currently registered F/FA products.
Thus, for continued registration of such F/FAs, compliance with Tier 1 and Tier 2 must occur within three years of promulgation
of the final rule. As proposed in the NPRM, this registration would be conditional on subsequent satisfaction of any
Tier 3 requirements which might be prescribed by the Agency. This means that if Tier 3 testing were prescribed for a
fuel or fuel additive product registered as of the time of promulgation, the registration would be extended for that
time which EPA specifies as necessary for completion of the prescribed Tier 3 requirements. Only upon satisfactory
completion of these requirements would re-registration occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of products for which manufacturers seek registration after promulgation of this rule, EPA is re-examining
the appropriateness of the timing of these Tier 3 provisions. As discussed in the NPRM, EPA interprets section 211(b)
in conjunction with section 211(c), which gives EPA authority to control or prohibit the manufacture, introduction
into commerce, offering for sale, or sale of any fuel or fuel additive if the Administrator finds that the emission
products of such fuel or fuel additive ``causes, or contributes, to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated
to endanger the public health or welfare.'' In light of this responsibility, EPA believes that it should exercise
particular caution in registering new 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA products that are significantly different from or have a usage pattern which is significantly different in scope
or character from currently registered 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA products. The potential health risks associated with the use of new F/FAs could be higher, lower, or the same as
those of current F/FAs. Thus, before permitting the introduction of these products into the market, the Agency must
have reasonable certainty that the public health consequences will not be made worse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clarification is therefore needed concerning what constitutes a ``new'' 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA. EPA believes it is appropriate to distinguish between two types of unregistered products which a manufacturer
might seek to register after the promulgation of the final rule: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA products similar in composition and usage to those already allowed wide commercial distribution (e.g., registered
for general use by other manufacturers), and (2) F/FA products which differ significantly in composition and/or
usage from such current products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To formalize this distinction, EPA is proposing to make use of grouping system concepts and definitions previously
discussed in the April 1992 NPRM. Specifically, EPA proposes that a F/FA product not registered by its manufacturer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as of the date of promulgation of this rule be designated as ``registrable'' if it meets the program's criteria for
grouping with a currently registered fuel or bulk additive
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the same fuel family
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Conversely, a F/FA product not registered by its manufacturer as of the date of promulgation would be designated
as ``new'' if it does not meet the program's criteria for grouping with a currently registered fuel or bulk additive
in the same fuel family. In these definitions, the term ``currently'' refers to the date on which EPA receives the registration
application for the F/FA in question.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of these definitions, registration is product-specific. Thus, if a particular fuel or additive product
has not been registered by its manufacturer, then that manufacturer does not have the right to introduce, market,
and/or sell this product, even if a compositionally similar or identical product has been registered by another manufacturer.

A ``bulk additive,'' sometimes called a ``general use'' additive, was defined in the NPRM as a product added to fuel
at the refinery as part of the original blending stream or after the fuel is transported from the refinery, but before
the fuel is purchased for introduction into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle. In contrast, an ``aftermarket additive,''
sometimes called a consumer additive, is an additive product marketed for introduction directly into the fuel system
of a motor vehicle.

``Fuel family'' refers to the primary categorization of F/FAs within the proposed grouping system. A fuel family
was defined in the NPRM as a set of F/FAs which share basic chemical and physical formulation characteristics and can
be used in the same engine or vehicle. Seven such fuel families were originally defined (unleaded gasoline, leaded
gasoline, diesel, methanol, ethanol, methane, and propane), although EPA now intends to delete the leaded gasoline
family in view of the prohibition under CAA section 211(n) of on-road use of leaded fuel after December 31, 1995. In
the proposed definition of ``registrable,'' the restriction ``in the same fuel family'' means that the similarity
of an applicant F/FA to a bulk additive currently registered for use in another fuel family would not suffice to make
the applicant F/FA registrable. This restriction is consistent with the general principles of the grouping system,
which permits grouping of F/FAs only within defined fuel families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to these definitions, an unregistered F/FA which meets the criteria for grouping only with a currently
registered aftermarket additive (and not also with a currently registered fuel and/or bulk additive) would not be
registrable. This does not preclude an unregistered aftermarket additive from being registrable (since aftermarket
additives can group with fuels and bulk additives), nor does it affect the registration status of currently registered
aftermarket additives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, an unregistered detergent additive (either bulk or aftermarket) intended for use in unleaded gasoline
and conforming to the ``substantially similar'' criteria for unleaded gasoline (56 FR 5352) would be registrable,
since it would be able to group with currently registered baseline unleaded gasoline fuels and bulk additives
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. On the other hand, an unregistered chromium-containing additive intended for use in unleaded gasoline would be
considered ``new'' rather than ``registrable,'' because there are no currently registered chromium-containing
fuels or bulk additives in the unleaded gasoline family with which the applicant additive could be grouped. Even if
a chromium-containing product had previously been registered as an aftermarket additive for unleaded gasoline
(prior to the ban on such aftermarket additives under CAA section 211(f)(1)(B)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or as a bulk additive for use in another fuel family (e.g., leaded gasoline or diesel fuel), the applicant additive
would still be considered ``new''.

Until the 1990 CAA Amendments went into effect, the statutory language of section 211(f) was interpreted as applying
only to unleaded gasoline fuels and related bulk additives. Thus, prior to November 15, 1990 (the effective date of
the CAA Amendments), aftermarket additives intended for use in unleaded gasoline and containing elements other
than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur were allowed to be registered. Under the 1990 CAA amendments,
all types of motor vehicle F/FAs were placed under section 211(f) jurisdiction. All aftermarket additives that were
not ``substantially similar'' and were introduced on or after November 15, 1990 were banned. However, this ban does
not apply to products first introduced into commerce prior to November 15, 1990 [CAA section 211(f)(1)(B)]. Thus,
``non-sub-sim'' gasoline aftermarket additives which had been registered prior to that date were allowed to retain
their registrations. These are so-called ``grandfathered'' aftermarket additives.

Under the original proposal, new F/FA products would automatically be allowed on the market after submission of Tier
1 and Tier 2 data, whether or not significant health effects concerns had arisen and whether or not EPA had sufficient
information to determine if action under section 211(c) were appropriate. However, to address the concerns described
above in relation to section 211(c), EPA is now proposing to require that manufacturers of new F/FA products (i.e.,
F/FA products not registered by their specific manufacturers as of the date of promulgation and not fitting the registrable
criteria) submit all testing requirements prior to registration, including Tier 3 when prescribed by the Agency.
This means that if EPA were to identify a need for additional testing at the Tier 3 level for a new F/FA, registration
would not be granted until satisfactory completion of all such requirements.

On the other hand, EPA is proposing to grant registration to ``registrable'' F/FAs upon the manufacturer's submittal
of the basic registration application and other pre-Tier 1 notification requirements (see NPRM)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Once registered, these products would be legally able to enter the market. Furthermore, these products would have
the same testing and compliance requirements as those specified for currently registered products, i.e., three
years from the date of promulgation for the completion of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements and, if Tier 3 testing were
prescribed, additional time consistent with the incremental testing requirements. Manufacturers' compliance
with these requirements could be accomplished independently or as a member of an existing group.

Even if an unregistered F/FA were ``registrable'', however, EPA could invoke other available regulatory authority
under Federal law to prevent its commerical distribution if EPA were to determine that such action was necessary to
protect the public health or welfare. For example, applicable sections of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)(15
U.S.C. section 2601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
), such as the Significant New Use rule or the Premanufacturing Notification process, could be invoked to require
health effects testing prior to commerical distribution of an F/FA product if, among other factors specified in TSCA,
there is a change in the use of the product or an increase in the magnitude and/or duration of exposure to the product
by human beings or the environment (15 U.S.C. section 2601 (a)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that the proposed distinctions between registrable and new F/FAs, both in terms of their definitions
and their respective compliance requirements, reflect reasonable regard for the public health and welfare without
undue interference in the F/FA marketplace. Because registrable F/FAs are defined such that they must be reasonably
similar in composition and usage to current F/FAs, their entry onto the market would generally not be expected to increase
the health or welfare risks potentially related to current F/FA emission exposures. In determining whether a manufacturer's
product is registrable, the omission of aftermarket additives from the relevant population of currently registered
F/FAs is intended to prevent a potentially large increase in public exposure to generally untested products which
had previously been relatively limited in distribution and usage. It also ensures that the ability to group with a
``grandfathered'' aftermarket additive would not confer ``registrability'' on an unregistered F/FA. This is consistent
with the congressional intent in CAA section 211(f)(1)(B) to preclude introduction into commerce of new aftermarket
additives which do not fit the ``substantially similar'' criteria. The omission of F/FAs in different fuel families
from the relevant population of current F/FAs is also intended to prevent potential increases in exposure to untested
products. Expanding the use of an additive from one fuel family to another (e.g., from diesel fuel to gasoline) would
significantly increase the overall size of the potential market for the product and thus the potential exposure to
its emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of these safeguards, EPA believes that additional protection to the public health would generally not be
achieved by prohibiting registrable F/FAs from entering the market while testing of these products (or groups of
similar products) proceeds. In the case of ``new'' F/FAs, however, EPA has no such assurances. By definition, these
F/FAs would be dissimilar in composition and/or usage to currently registered products, and allowing their introduction
could not reasonably be assumed to have no adverse effects on the health or welfare of the general population. For these
F/FAs, therefore, EPA believes that it must protect the public health and welfare by requiring compliance with all
data requests it deems necessary before exposing the public to potentially increased risk.

Figure 1 summarizes the decision process for determining whether an unregistered F/FA product would be ``registrable''
(and thus handled much like a currently registered product), or whether an unregistered F/FA product would not be
``registrable'' and must complete all testing requirements before registration is granted.

As a result of these modifications to the original proposal, EPA would have an opportunity to evaluate fully the potential
health effects of truly new products before they enter the marketplace. On the other hand, F/FAs similar to those already
registered would not be arbitrarily kept from the market during the compliance period simply because of the relationship
between their date of introduction and the effective date of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA interprets section 211(e) to support the approach contained in this notice. EPA believes that the reference in
CAA section 211(e)(2) (A) and (B) to a ``fuel or fuel additive which is registered'' or ``which is not registered''
is ambiguous as to whether it refers to the F/FA generally or to a particular product-specific registration. Given
this ambiguity, EPA believes that it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``fuel or fuel additive which is registered''
to refer to the F/FAs generally. Further, EPA believes it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``registered'' to
include both F/FAs that are either ``registered'' or ``registrable.'' ``Registrable'' F/FAs are sufficiently
similar in composition and use to existing F/FAs that one would not expect them to have dissimilar health effects;
and therefore, it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``registered fuel or fuel additive'' to include not only those
F/FAs that are identical, but also those that can group with existing F/FAs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatively, EPA believes that the approach in this notice is consistent with section 211 because EPA interprets
section 211(e)(3) (A) and (B) in conjunction with section 211(e)(3)(C), which gives EPA authority to exempt any F/FA
from duplicative testing. Thus, even if one interprets the phrase ``fuel or fuel additive which [is/is not] registered''
to mean either that an identical F/FA must already have a registration, or to refer to a product-specific registration,
EPA believes it is reasonable to interpret section 211(e)(3)(C) to allow F/FAs that are similar in composition and
usage to those already on the market to group with those similar F/FAs and complete the testing with the other F/FAs
in their group. At the same time, EPA believes that for F/FAs that differ significantly in composition or usage from
currently registered F/FAs, such testing would not be duplicative of testing of groups of registered F/FAs; and therefore,
EPA is authorized under section 211(e) to require this information prior to registration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under either theory, EPA's authority to obtain information is not limited to Tier 1 and Tier 2 data, because section
211(b)(2)(B) gives EPA authority to require any information necessary to assess the effects of emissions on public
health or welfare. Therefore, EPA interprets section 211 (e) and (b) to give it the authority to require any necessary
health or welfare effects information for F/FAs that are significantly different in composition or usage from currently
registered products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA solicits comments on its interpretation of CAA section 211 as it applies to the approach outlined in this notice
and on the proposed compliance requirements for F/FA products which manufacturers may seek to register after promulgation
of this rule. EPA is proposing: (1) To allow those products fitting the definition of ``registrable'' to become registered
and thus subject to the same compliance and timing requirements as currently registered products, and (2) to require
manufacturers of ``new'' F/FAs (i.e., those not in conformance with the definition of ``registrable'') to submit
any information EPA requires, potentially including Tier 3, prior to registration. Based on its analysis of the public
comments on these proposed provisions, EPA may adopt both proposals, adopt one proposal, or reject both proposals.

B. Alternative Testing Requirements in Lieu of Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained in the NPRM, the main purpose of the proposed rule is to obtain information for the identification and
evaluation of potential health effects of F/FA emissions in order to guide EPA in future regulatory actions. CAA section
211(b)(2)(A) gives EPA the authority to require the manufacturer of any fuel or fuel additive ``to conduct tests to
determine potential public health effects of such fuel or additive (including, but not limited to, carcinogenic,
teratogenic, or mutagenic effects).'' Thus, the statute gives EPA discretion to require the examination of other
endpoints of concern in addition to the mandatory areas of testing described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Tier 2 program in the NPRM proposed to establish a testing framework that incorporated the screening of several
health effects endpoints relevant to the assessment of the public health impacts of F/FA emissions, including those
endpoints mandated by the statute. In general, EPA still intends to maintain a standard Tier 2 biological testing
program as a requirement for registration. Thus, the prescribed Tier 2 tests to be included in the final rule would
apply to nearly all F/FAs seeking compliance with registration requirements, to the extent that the results of the
data search activities in Tier 1 do not include comparable existing information from adequately performed and properly
documented previous studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA is now proposing a special provision which would give EPA discretion to require different testing requirements
in lieu of the standard Tier 2 program, in order to address specific health concerns for a particular fuel or fuel additive
product. EPA recognizes that, in some special cases, more exhaustive or specifically focused tests might be warranted
in lieu of the screening Tier 2 tests, based on already available health effects information. For example, for a particular
fuel or fuel additive product, information could already be available to EPA (independent of this proposed program)
which indicates that testing should be targeted to an identified health concern that is not specifically addressed
in Tier 2 or that calls for more definitive testing than would ordinarily occur under Tier 2. The currently proposed
testing program structure certainly allows EPA to require such tests under Tier 3 after the evaluation of the previous
tiers. However, in this special case, requiring more definitive tests or other appropriate endpoint tests earlier
in the testing program would result in overall savings to the manufacturer while providing EPA with the needed data
earlier to assess the potential health risks for the particular fuel or fuel additive in question. Under this special
provision EPA would also be able to prescribe additional tests to be performed along with the standard Tier 2 program
as well as substituting different tests. EPA asks for comments on this proposed provision that would allow EPA to prescribe
alternative tests in lieu of (or in addition to) the standard Tier 2 tests in special cases.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If EPA decided to exercise its authority under this special provision, EPA would allow an appropriate time for completion
of the prescribed tests. For instance, if ancillary tests to Tier 2 were prescribed for a registered F/FA, the usual
three-year timeframe for completing Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements would no longer apply. Instead, EPA would allow
additional time for completion of the alternative testing program (i.e., Tier 2 as well as the ancillary tests prescribed
under this provision) in this special case. Similar compliance allowances would be made if different tests (e.g.,
chronic tests) were prescribed in lieu of the standard Tier 2 screening tests. For registered F/FAs, EPA would notify
the manufacturer (or group) by certified mail letter, within eighteen months of promulgation of the final rule, of
the specific tests to be done in lieu of the standard Tier 2 regimen, along with a schedule for compliance and submittal
of test results. A

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice would also be published to give the public opportunity to comment on the intended testing regimen. A public
hearing would not be held, however. The responsible manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) would have 60 days to
comment on the prescribed tests and timing requirements. If the responsible manufacturer did not provide any comments,
EPA would assume that the manufacturer had consented in full with the prescribed testing program. Similar notification
arrangements would apply to manufacturers of currently unregistered F/FAs. In this instance, EPA would notify the
new applicant (by certified mail letter) of the nonstandard requirements within eighteen months of EPA's learning
of the manufacturer's intent to register a product. EPA welcomes comments on the proposed notification and comment
procedures for this special provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, EPA considers the normal Tier 2 testing regimen to be applicable, appropriate, and valuable for the health
effects evaluation of F/FA emissions, even if higher-level testing is later required under the provisions of Tier
3. Thus, EPA would exercise the special authority to prescribe other testing requirements in addition to or in lieu
of the standard Tier 2 regimen only in exceptional cases. The exercise of this authority would be done wholly at EPA's
discretion. F/FA manufacturers would be specifically discouraged from submitting applications or requests to
EPA for Tier 2 substitutions, and EPA would be under no obligation to consider or respond to any such requests.

A. General Emission Generation Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed that F/FA manufacturers would be required to conduct a detailed characterization of the emissions
of their products, as well as biological tests in which animals are exposed to these emissions. The use of applicable
portions of the standard Federal Test Procedure (FTP) was proposed for generating exhaust emissions for these purposes.
For biological testing of products predominantly used in light-duty vehicle applications, EPA proposed the use
of one light-duty vehicle operating over continuous, repeated Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycles
(i.e., a transient speed driving sequence used to simulate typical urban driving) performed on a chassis dynamometer.
An engine dynamometer operated on the Engine Dynamometer Schedule (EDS) was presented as an option. The EDS is a transient
engine speed versus torque time sequence commonly used in heavy-duty engine evaluation. It was proposed that the
EDS would be used to generate emissions in heavy-duty applications. EPA also proposed that all test vehicles and engines
should possess all of the emission control equipment normally recommended by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their comments on the NPRM, the regulated industry questioned the appropriateness of using the FTP to generate
emissions for biological testing, given the inherent variable nature of FTP-generated emissions. In response to
these comments, EPA is considering several alternative approaches as discussed below. EPA asks for comments on the
suitability of these proposals and on alternative methods suitable for the generation of emissions to be used in the
biological testing of F/FAs. To be most useful, such comments should include a detailed discussion on the recommended
methodology, including advantages and disadvantages.

EPA is considering the use of non-transient methods as an alternative approach to FTP or other transient cycles to
reduce the potential variability in the emission stream. The rationale behind this approach is discussed below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The determination of an exposure/health effect relationship requires a constant, well-controlled, and measurable
exposure environment. A high degree of variability in emission properties such as heat, pressure, water vapor, CO,
NOx, CO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, total hydrocarbons, and specific chemical composition could complicate the measurement and determination of
the actual exposure levels that occur during toxicology testing. During transient cycles, physical and chemical
properties of the exhaust stream can vary significantly. In addition, a high percentage of emissions are produced
in concentrated spikes (related to the enriched conditions present during accelerations) that result in a series
of alternating high and low level exposures. This variability could be difficult to accommodate in the context of
the inhalation toxicology tests proposed in this rule. Therefore, EPA is considering the use of single-mode (steady
state) operating conditions for generating emissions in the F/FA testing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to reducing variability, non-transient methods might also provide a better simulation of ambient conditions.
Ambient air contains emissions from many thousands of vehicles of varying technologies, age, and state of maintenance.
At any point in time, these vehicles are in different stages of operation under various engine loads. As a collective
average of the emissions from these sources, the ambient air typically varies gradually over a period of hours or days.
In contrast, UDDS emissions vary significantly from second to second. For these reasons, the ambient air actually
resembles a steady state condition more closely than a transient state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another potential advantage of running the test vehicle or engine under single-mode conditions is that it would permit
less sophisticated and less expensive dynamometer equipment (e.g., water-brake dynamometers) to be used for emission
generation. This could help to encourage additional biological testing laboratories to obtain the equipment necessary
for conducting the test exposures required in this program, and might also increase the feasibility of using portable
dynamometers for these purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the use of a non-transient rather than a transient cycle for generating emissions raises legitimate
concerns that the emission stream could be missing certain toxicologically active species which would ordinarily
be generated in appreciable amounts only during accelerations. However, these concerns might be allayed to some
extent by two other emission generation specifications which EPA is considering: the use of engine-out (non-catalyzed)
rather than tailpipe catalyzed emissions (see section III.A.2, below) and the use of high-load, fuel-enriched operating
conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To maximize the emission species occuring in the exhaust stream during non-transient operation, EPA is considering
different vehicle/engine operating specifications or emission performance requirements. One approach under
consideration is to specify the speed and throttle requirements, e.g., 25 percent of full throttle at a constant speed
of 20 mph (the average speed of the FTP). An alternative method would be to specify a high load requirement directly
(e.g., 50 percent load at 20 mph). One factor to consider is that the vehicle/engine operating conditions must be achievable
without exceeding the load which a typical well-maintained, modern engine can handle for prolonged periods of time
without breaking down. EPA requests comments and advice on this practical constraint. A different approach would
be to require the modification of electronic computer controls to manage fuel injection so as to achieve a suitably
enriched air/fuel ratio under steady-state operation. Programming a vehicle to operate in open-loop mode is one
example of this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather than specifying the operating conditions to be used during non-transient vehicle/engine operation, EPA
could choose to specify performance criteria which would achieve suitable emission levels. These criteria would
be based on selected exhaust or exposure concentrations of key emissions for biological testing (e.g., CO, total
HC). This approach would allow operators the flexibility to determine the most appropriate vehicle/engine conditions
and/or computer controls needed to obtain an exhaust stream containing the required concentration ranges of specific
emissions. For example, EPA could require that the concentration of total hydrocarbons in the exhaust must exceed
a specified amount and/or that the CO concentration be less than a specified maximum. Because different test vehicles/engines
would be required to meet the same criteria, this approach might reduce the potential test-to-test variability which
might result if EPA were to specify a particular set of operating conditions and require that set to be applied across
all vehicle/engine technologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA invites comments on the possibility of using a non-transient cycle rather than the FTP for generating emissions
for biological testing. Specific comments are requested on the effectiveness of the various approaches discussed
above for achieving the desired emission enrichment during steady-state operation. Comments on the specific speed,
throttle, load specifications, computer controls, and/or performance criteria mentioned above are also requested,
and suggestions as to suitable alternative methods or specifications are welcome. Such suggestions will be particularly
helpful if supporting data and rationale are provided. Detailed emission speciation data/profiles contrasting
engine/vehicle operating conditions (e.g., transient versus non-transient, especially under engine-out conditions)
are also solicited.

2. Alternative Approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although EPA is considering steady state conditions for the generation of emissions in the final rule, it has not excluded
the possibility of using the previously proposed FTP method or other transient or semi-transient (e.g., multi-modal)
methods. EPA solicits detailed comments on whether transient methods are necessary to ensure that toxicologically
significant species will not be unintentionally omitted from the emission stream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is considering the use of emission conditioning techniques that could potentially accommodate transient cycle
emission generation within the context of the F/FA inhalation toxicity testing program. One option being considered
would use constant dilution ratio equipment (e.g., the mini-diluter or variable flow rate ``constant volume sampling''
(VFR&hyph;CVS) systems) being developed and evaluated in the American Industry/Government Emissions Research,
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (AIGER CRADA) to limit the transient variability characteristics
of classical CVS (variable dilution ratio) exhaust. With this equipment, the diluent can be managed to achieve desired
CO, CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and water vapor concentrations (e.g., to avoid animal asphyxiation or water condensation) and sample temperatures
prior to being directed to the biological exposure chambers. Concentration swings will occur when the engine air/fuel
ratio diverges from stoichiometric combustion, but for only short durations of time. EPA recognizes that this is
a developing technology and invites comments, suggestions, and supporting data on its possible application in the

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA biological testing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative that would allow management of the variability of transient vehicle exhaust is use of a mixing
chamber between the classical CVS source and the exposure chamber. The transient exhaust would be injected into a
large dilution/mixing/integration chamber prior to its delivery to the animal exposure chamber. This would allow
necessary adjustment of the exhaust concentrations and integration of the large concentration swings typical of
CVS exhaust, prior to exposing the animals. The mixing chamber would be charged from the CVS at a constant rate determined
by the exposure chamber purge rate. The exposure chamber flow could begin at the conclusion of the initial transient
cycle with the associated mixing chamber charge. EPA requests comments on the feasibility of using mixing chambers
to condition diluted transient exhaust for animal exposure in the context of the F/FA testing program.

3. Engine-Out Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is also considering the use of engine-out (i.e., non-catalyzed) rather than catalyzed tailpipe emissions for
biological testing, to assure that the test animals will be exposed to the full range of emission species potentially
resulting from the combustion of F/FAs. With modern emission control technology in place, most of the ambient air
pollutant species attributable to automobile exhaust come from two sources: malfunctioning vehicles (``high emitters'')
and normal vehicles during their cold start period, when their engines run rich and their catalytic converters have
not yet reached effective operating temperatures. The variety of emissions from these two important sources are
not well represented by hot, catalyzed exhaust generated from well-maintained, modern vehicles. Emissions during
the cold-start include hundreds of organic chemical species which are generated before the catalytic converter
reaches its effective temperature. Once the catalytic converter is warmed-up, its efficiency increases to the point
where only a dozen or so simple compounds remain in readily measurable amounts in the catalyzed exhaust. Thus, the
use of treated exhaust in the biological testing program would expose the laboratory animals to only a very few of the
organic emission species associated with the combustion of the fuel or additive of interest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In vivo 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
testing requires continuous air changes in the animal chambers to avoid confounding health effects (e.g., lung and
skin irritations, hypoxia, bacterial infections, heat exhaustion, etc.) caused by a build-up of metabolic by-products
(e.g., CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ammonia, humidity and body heat) of the animal test population. Because of the need for frequent air changes, the
initial cold-start emissions would remain in the exposure chamber for only a few minutes before being flushed out.
Assuming catalyzed emissions were used, the remaining hours of each day's test period would expose the animals only
to the relatively few species that remain in hot, treated exhaust. Thus, the use of catalyzed exhaust for biological
exposures could exclude from the tests relevant emission species that could potentially be harmful to human health
or the environment. In contrast, the ambient air normally contains the full range of combustion emissions, since
cold-start emissions are continuously re-introduced and some ``high emitters'' are always in operation. Since
humans experience continuous exposure to these emissions, EPA believes it is important that they be included in the
test exposure atmosphere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several possible methods have been considered for increasing the frequency and/or duration of biological exposures
to actual cold-start emissions. These included the use of emission storage and retrieval systems, use of an enhanced
engine and exhaust cooling system, and the use of a fleet of identical vehicles that could be interchanged to provide
natural cooling periods. However, each of these methods could introduce still more technical challenges. Thus,
EPA believes that production of a constant supply of genuine cold-start emissions could be an impractical requirement
for the type of toxicology tests required in this program. Comments and suggestions on these issues are welcome.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Instead of attempting to produce a constant supply of cold-start emissions, EPA is considering the possibility of
requiring manufacturers to use engine-out emissions as a surrogate for cold-start emissions. Recognizing that
an ineffective catalytic converter is the major (though not only) vehicle-related factor which differentiates
the cold start, EPA has compared cold-start emissions and high-emitting vehicle emissions to engine-out emissions
using available emission data. This analysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 showed that, in terms of both chemical composition and relative concentrations, engine-out organic emissions closely
resemble cold-start and high-emitting vehicle emissions. In addition, a comparison of FTP composite emissions
showed that engine-out and tailpipe organic emission species were nearly the same on a qualitative basis, although
the engine-out emissions appeared at a greater overall concentration. Thus, bypassing the catalyst produced emissions
representing a comprehensive aggregate of characteristic combustion products at enriched concentrations, including
the species which are otherwise emitted only during the cold start. The enrichment of organic emissions is an important
side benefit for the biological testing program because richer hydrocarbon streams will be available for toxicology
testing for any given level of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and water vapor. (It should be noted, however, that CO levels are also raised, and may themselves become a limiting
factor.) EPA requests comments on the use of engine-out emissions for the F/FA biological testing program and welcomes
suggestions regarding this proposal or other alternative approaches. To be most useful, such comments should include
supporting emission data.

With the exception of exhaust after-treatment devices, EPA proposes that all normally required emission control
equipment be present and fully operational on all test vehicles and heavy-duty engines used in the generation of engine-out
emissions. This may require replacing catalytic converters and particulate traps with other devices capable of
simulating the back pressure, residence time, and mixing characteristics usually provided by these devices. Another
approach could be to install a blank catalyst (no catalytic wash coat) in the exhaust system where the production catalyst
would normally be installed. EPA requests comments and suggestions on this or other suitable alternative methods
that would ensure the appropriate operation of the exhaust system.

In the NPRM, EPA proposed 25,000 miles as the minimum mileage which must be accumulated on the emission-generation
vehicle before generating emissions for characterization and animal testing purposes. For fuels and fuel additives
containing atypical elements, mileage accumulation was proposed to continue after 25,000 miles, if needed, until
the emissions of the atypical element(s) reached steady state or until the vehicle or engine has been operated for
80 percent of its estimated useful life (e.g., 80,000 miles for light-duty vehicles). ``Steady state'' was defined
in the proposal as the point at which the mass of the atypical elements emitted during the performance of one or more
UDDS or engine dynamometer schedules is within 10 percent of the mass of the atypical elements that entered the combustion
chamber during the driving cycles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based in part on comments received from the regulated industry, EPA is now considering different mileage accumulation
approaches. In the case of a fuel or fuel/additive mixture meeting baseline or non-baseline criteria, EPA believes
that an accumulation of 4,000 miles on a light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck or 125 hours on a heavy-duty vehicle
(fueled exclusively with the fuel or fuel/additive mixture to be tested), should be sufficient to stabilize emissions.
The 4,000 mile/125 hour mileage accumulation requirements are consistent with the emission stabilization procedures
used for emission-data vehicles in EPA's new vehicle certification program.

In the case of F/FAs with atypical elements, EPA is concerned that the requirement to reach a mass-balance steady state
prior to generating emissions for testing might be too stringent. In fact, in some cases, a measured input-output
mass balance might never be reached. Thus, EPA is considering a different approach for atypical F/FAs. The minimum
mileage accumulation that vehicles/engines testing atypical F/FAs would be required to undergo would be 4,000 miles,
the same mileage accumulation now proposed for the testing of baseline and non-baseline F/FAs. After completion
of the 4,000 miles, the F/FA manufacturer would be required to identify and measure the atypical element(s) in the
exhaust, if possible. Because the presence of the atypical species in specific emission fractions will be dependent
on the nature of the particular atypical element, EPA would recommend examination of all emission fractions (i.e.,
vapor, semi-volatile, and particulate). If the atypical element(s) of interest are not detected in at least one of
the emission fractions after 4,000 miles, the manufacturer would then need to continue mileage accumulation until
the atypical element(s) are at high enough level(s) for accurate identification and measurement. The intervals
at which the emissions should be examined for detection of the atypical element(s) is proposed to be left to the manufacturer's
discretion. Once the atypical element(s) of interest are detected in at least one emission fraction, an additional
10,000 miles would be required prior to generation of emissions for purposes of emission characterization and biological
testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA solicits comments and suggestions on the proposed mileage accumulation requirements for baseline, non-baseline,
and atypical F/FAs. If alternative approaches are provided, EPA requests commenters to include supporting data
and a detailed discussion so as to allow an appropriate analysis of the options.

C. Base Fuel Specifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed the use of base fuels to represent theoretical ``industry average'' or normative formulations
for each defined fuel family. EPA was to develop chemical and physical specifications to define a specific base fuel
(including a minimum required additive package) for each fuel family. The base fuels were proposed to serve as the
group representatives in compliance with testing requirements for baseline F/FA groups. The base fuels were also
proposed to serve as the fuel substrates into which additives which were undergoing evaluation would be mixed prior
to emission generation and testing. Tests conducted on the emissions of the base fuel would then serve as controls
against which tests on the emissions of the additive/base fuel mixture would be compared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although base fuel definitions for the conventional fuel families (gasoline and diesel) were discussed in a memorandum
to the docket (``Base Fuel Determination Procedures for the Proposed Fuels and Fuel Additives Rulemaking,'' see
Public Docket No. A&hyph;90&hyph;07), EPA did not specify at that time the required additive package for conventional
fuels or the base fuel specifications for alternative fuels. The proposed specifications for the unleaded gasoline
and diesel base fuels are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Comments are requested on these specifications,
with particular emphasis on the additive functions proposed to be included in each base fuel. The base additive packages
are intended to include only those additive functions that are essential for fuel production or engine operation
and/or those required by law. Selection of the specific product within each specified additive functional category
would be up to the formulator of the base fuel and/or the test operator. However, additive products which include elements
other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen would not be allowed as part of the base fuel/additive formulation.
The base additives would be required to be used at their minimum effective concentrations in the base fuel.

EPA has also developed proposed base fuel specifications for alternative fuels, based on California Air Resources
Board (CARB) definitions and other available information. EPA requests comments on the proposed base fuel specifications,
discussed below for each alternative fuel family. At this time, much less in-use data is available for alternative
fuels than for conventional fuels, and some of these fuels and their associated vehicle/engine technologies are
still under development. EPA thus proposes to allow some flexibility (with specific EPA approval) in the base fuel
formulations specified for the alternative fuel families, if necessitated by technological changes occurring
after final promulgation of the specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such changes might be particularly necessary in regard to the additives specified to be used as part of the base fuels.
For example, the proposed M100 base fuel (see below) is specified to contain no additives. This proposed specification
reflects EPA's understanding that M100 fuel is currently used without additives in heavy-duty buses in California.
However, as experience accumulates and/or if other M100 vehicle technologies become predominant, the need for a
minimum complement of additives (such as agents to increase the lubricity or auto-ignition characteristics of M100)
may become evident. In such cases, EPA would review and (if justified) approve requests from alternative fuel manufacturers
to modify the base fuel (and/or additive) specifications. Such requests would generally be deemed to be justified
if consistent with the associated vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for operation of the vehicle. Public
notice of any approved changes to the base fuels (and/or their additive components) would be published in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed in the NPRM, the baseline category within the methanol fuel family would contain two F/FA groups: the M100
group (to include methanol formulations with at least 96 percent methanol by volume) and the M85 group (to include
methanol formulations with 50&hyph;95 percent methanol by volume). Each of these baseline methanol groups would
have its own base fuel. These base fuels would contain no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
sulfur, and chlorine. The chlorine (as chloride) would be permitted as a contaminant remaining from methanol production,
and would be limited to no more than 0.0001 percent by mass. The sulfur content may not exceed 0.002 percent by mass in
the M100 base fuel and may not exceed 0.004 percent by mass in the M85 base fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The M100 base fuel would be required to consist of 100 percent by volume chemical grade methanol. The M85 base fuel would
contain 85 percent by volume chemical grade methanol, blended with 15 volume percent unleaded gasoline base fuel
(as described in Table 1). No additives other than those contained in the gasoline base fuel component would be allowed.
Specifications for the methanol base fuels are presented in Table 3.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Some gasoline detergents have been shown to cause intake system deposits when used in M85 applications. Likewise,
lubricating oils containing calcium have been shown to cause injector tip deposits in M100 applications. Therefore,
EPA recommends that F/FA producers determine the methanol compatibility of lubricating oils as well as fuel additives
used in the gasoline portion of the M85 base fuel. EPA requests comments on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
2. Ethanol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In the NPRM, EPA proposed two baseline groups for the ethanol fuel family: E100 group and E85 group. However, EPA is
now considering defining only one group for baseline ethanol formulations. This single baseline ethanol group would
be represented by E85 base fuel. The rationale behind this proposal is that fuel ethanol is required to contain at least
5 percent denaturant, which means that, in actuality, E100 formulations contain only 95 percent ethanol (i.e., E95).
Furthermore, gasoline is normally used as the denaturant for ethanol fuels. EPA believes that there would be little
incremental value in requiring tests of E95 in addition to E85, and thus proposes to create a single baseline ethanol
group represented by an E85 base fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The E85 base fuel would contain no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine, and
copper. The chlorine (as chloride) would be permitted as a contaminant remaining from ethanol production, and would
be limited to no more than 0.0004 percent by mass. The sulfur content in the E85 base fuel may not exceed 0.004 percent
by mass. Copper, also a contaminant from ethanol production, would be limited to 0.07 mg/L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The E85 base fuel would contain 85 percent by volume chemical grade ethanol, blended with 15 volume percent unleaded
gasoline base fuel. No additives, beyond those included in the gasoline base fuel portion of the ethanol blends, would
be included in the E85 base fuel. Additives used in the gasoline component of E85 should be ethanol-compatible. A summary
of the ethanol base fuel specifications is provided in Table 4.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
3. Methane (CNG, LNG) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The methane fuel family would be represented by a natural gas base fuel whose elemental composition is limited to CHONS,
with the sulfur present only as an odorant for leak detection purposes and limited to 16 parts per million (by volume).
The added odorant should be used at a level such that at ambient conditions the fuel must have a distinctive odor potent
enough for its presence to be detected down to a concentration in air of not over 1/5 (one-fifth) of the lower limit of
flammability. No other additives would be included in the base fuel. The proposed methane base fuel specifications
are presented in Table 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
4. Propane (LPG) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Special-duty propane, as defined in ASTM specification D&hyph;1835, is proposed to serve as the propane base fuel.
The propane base fuel may contain no elements other than CHONS, with the sulfur present as an added odorant for leak
detection purposes and limited to 120 ppm (by weight). The added odorant should be used at a level such that at ambient
conditions the fuel must have a distinctive odor potent enough for its presence to be detected down to a concentration
in air of not over 1/5 (one-fifth) of the lower limit of flammability. No other additive would be allowed included in
the base fuel. The proposed base fuel specifications for propane are presented in Table 6.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) requests public comments on a proposed rule that would annually allocate the
U.S. Pacific whiting harvest guideline or quota, in 1994 through 1996, between: Fishing vessels that either catch
and process at sea or catch and deliver to at-sea processors; and fishing vessels that deliver to processors located
on shore. In each of the 3 years, after 60 percent of the annual harvest guideline (or quota) for whiting is taken, further
at-sea processing in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) would be prohibited, and the remaining 40 percent (104,000
metric tons (mt) in 1994) would be reserved initially for fishing vessels that deliver to shore-based processors.
On or about August 15, any amount of the harvest guideline (including any part of the 40 percent initially held in reserve)
that is determined by the Northwest Regional Director, NMFS, not to be needed by the shoreside sector during the remainder
of the year would be made available to the at-sea processing sector. This action is intended to promote the goals and
objectives of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) by providing for equitable sharing of the
harvest guideline between shore-based and at-sea processors; by contributing to the economies of coastal communities
by providing reasonable opportunity for shoreside processing of the whiting harvest guideline; and by promoting
stability in the west coast fishing industry by diverting effort from other fully-utilized fisheries.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NOAA is issuing a proposed rule based on a recommendation of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), under
the authority of the FMP and the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The domestic and foreign groundfish fisheries in the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California are
managed by the Secretary according to the FMP prepared by the Council under the authority of the Magnuson Act. The FMP
is implemented by regulations for U.S. fishermen at 50 CFR part 663. General regulations applicable to U.S. fishermen
are at 50 CFR part 620. The FMP has been amended 6 times. Amendment 4 contains a framework process (the socio-economic
framework) that provides the authority, guidelines, and criteria for establishing management measures that address
social and economic conditions within the fishery. These measures can be implemented by regulation, without further
amending the FMP, through the procedures contained in Amendment 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pacific whiting is the largest groundfish resource managed by the Council, and makes up over 50 percent of the potential
annual groundfish harvest. Prior to 1980, this species was harvested primarily by foreign fishing vessels. Foreign
directed fishing for whiting ended in 1989, when all the available whiting were allocated to U.S. fishermen, mostly
for delivery of raw fish to foreign processing vessels under joint venture arrangements. By mid-1990 it was clear
that over-capacity of the harvesting and processing sectors in the Alaska groundfish fisheries was causing shorter
fishing seasons and that participants were looking for alternative resources, both inside and outside Alaska.

In 1991, the Council recommended, and the Secretary approved, a proposal to allocate the 228,000-mt 1991 Pacific
whiting quota 104,000 mt to catcher/processors and 88,000 mt to fishing vessels that do not process (including vessels
that delivered whiting both to shoreside plants and to motherships), with 36,000 mt reserved for priority access
for the shoreside sector (56 FR 43718, September 4, 1991). The actual 1991 harvest was 117,000 mt by factory trawlers,
80,000 mt delivered to motherships, and 21,000 mt delivered to shoreside processors.

In 1992, no more than 98,800 mt of whiting initially could be processed at sea, 80,000 mt was allocated to vessels delivering
to shoreside processors, and 30,000 mt was retained in reserve with a priority for use by the shoreside sector. The
30,000-mt reserve was released to at-sea processing operations on September 4, and an additional 24,000 mt of the
initial shoreside allocation was made available for at-sea processing on October 1. In 1992, factory trawlers again
harvested 117,000 mt, motherships received 36,000 mt and 56,000 mt was delivered to shoreside processing plants.

In 1993, the first 112,000 mt of the 142,000 mt harvest guideline was available for open competition (``olympic fishery''),
with the remaining 30,000 mt held in reserve for shoreside processing. This assumed that vessels delivering shoreside
would harvest about 12,000 mt during the olympic fishery, for a total of 42,000 mt for the year. When it became apparent
that shoreside deliveries were substantially lower than expected during the olympic fishery, an emergency rule
was issued that prohibited processing at sea when 100,000 mt was taken by the at-sea processing sector. Therefore,
42,000 mt was reserved for vessels delivering shoreside in 1993. The regulations also included a provision for releasing
any unneeded portion of the shoreside allocation on September 1, to ensure the harvest guideline would be fully utilized.
However, shore-based processors used their entire allocation and no additional whiting were made available for
processing at sea in 1993. The at-sea processing sector harvested 99,103 mt in 1993 (84,588 mt by catcher/processors
and 14,515 mt by vessels that delivered to motherships). Shore-based landings were about 41,859 mt in 1993. In total,
140,962 mt of whiting were caught in 1993, over 99 percent of the 142,000 mt harvest guideline.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fleet composition in the 1994 whiting fishery may be quite different than in 1992 and 1993. A license limitation
(``limited entry'') program was implemented under Amendment 6 to the FMP, and became effective on January 1, 1994.
The limited entry program requires trawl vessels targeting on groundfish to have a limited entry permit. Limited
entry permits were issued to vessels that landed a minimum amount of groundfish during the window period (July 11,
1984_August 1, 1988). Permits also were issued to vessels purchased or under construction or conversion during the
window period that later had a certain level of participation in the fishery. The permits may be bought and sold. Therefore,
the traditional vessels that were active in the whiting fishery during the window period initially received permits
while entrants after 1988 (which includes the catcher/processor fleet) are not able to operate in the fishery unless
they buy or lease permits sufficient for these vessels to operate. In 1993, 16 catcher/processors operated in the
whiting fishery. As of January 20, 1994, it appears that one catcher/processor may initially receive a limited entry
permit while several others might acquire enough limited entry permits to operate as a catcher/processor (rather
than a mothership) in the 1994 whiting fishery. However, the catcher/processor fleet is expected to be much smaller
than in 1992 and 1993_the whiting market is weak and too few permits are likely to be available for purchase to accommodate
the entire whiting catcher/processor fleet. The final composition of the whiting fleet for 1994 and beyond will not
be known until the fishery is underway, but it is clear that future participation by the catcher/processor fleet will
be constrained by implementation of the limited entry program in 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statement of the Problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the fishing and processing sectors of the whiting fishery continue to be overcapitalized, which means there
is more capacity than needed to take and to process the entire harvest guideline. The at-sea processing sector is more
mobile and thus able to follow whiting that migrate from south to north during the March&hyph;October/November fishing
season. Catcher/processors and catcher vessels delivering to motherships do not lose fishing time by having to return
to shore to offload. Until 1994, there have been more at-sea processing vessels (as many as 26 in a given year) than shore-based
plants (10&hyph;12 major plants). The at-sea processing fleet generally prefers shorter, intense seasons to minimize
operating costs, and to ``fill in'' between other fisheries, particularly the pollock fisheries off Alaska. The
shore-based plants clearly are not mobile and are limited by the availability of whiting as it migrates within range
of local ports. Shore-based processing plants tend to prefer a longer, slower season to maintain their work force
and markets when other fisheries are less productive. Even under limited entry, the potential exists for the at-sea
processing sector to preempt the shoreside sector's opportunity for a longer processing season if enough at-sea
processing capacity enters the whiting fishery. Although limited entry may reduce the number of catcher/processors
that harvest whiting, it has no effect on the number of at-sea processors that may choose to offer at-sea markets to
catcher boats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shore-based fleet and processing plants now are established components of the whiting industry, not likely to
be totally preempted by the at-sea fleet. They are, however, vulnerable to severe economic impacts should landings
be precipitously reduced by unrestricted at-sea processing taking much of the harvest guideline in a fast, early
fishery. The Council believes that even partial preemption of shoreside processing opportunities will result in
an inequitable redistribution of economic benefits between sectors of the industry. The greatest change in the fishery
in 1994 will be due to implementation of the limited entry program. Even though the traditional catcher vessels might
appear to be protected from the rapid and intense competition of the catcher/processor fleet, concern remains that
market opportunities might be severely restricted by an at-sea processing fleet consisting of motherships (including
former catcher/processors acting as motherships) or of catcher/processors accumulating enough permits to operate
in the fishery. The mothership fleet provides a viable market for the traditional catcher vessels, and to this extent
is beneficial to the catcher fleet. However, if the mothership fishery attracts a large number of catcher/processors
acting only as motherships, and if they are able to process whiting almost as rapidly as when they acted as catcher/processors
(which is expected), the harvest guideline still could be taken in a matter of weeks (as early as May 31, 1994, according
to Table 7&hyph;2 in the EA/RIR). The Council believes the traditional catcher fleet's market opportunities are
enhanced when there are viable, competing markets both onshore and offshore over a longer period of time, and therefore
a less intense, slower fishery appears to benefit market choices for these vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council also is concerned that preemption of harvesting opportunities for whiting catcher boats will result
in those vessels transferring additional fishing effort into the traditional groundfish fisheries for rockfish,
sablefish, and flatfish, which already are fully utilized. Increased effort in the non-whiting groundfish fishery
could result in shortened seasons and more restrictive trip limits for all groundfish fishing vessels, could economically
disadvantage many fishermen, and could exacerbate the current problem of excessive discards and wastage attributed
to restrictive regulations. To the extent that the Council can maintain employment for the traditional joint venture
fishing vessels in the Pacific whiting fishery, adverse impacts on the other groundfish fisheries will be lessened.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Council and the industry desire stability in the regulatory process. For each of the last 3 years,
the Council submitted recommendations for allocations to the Secretary. Uncertainty as to what the allocation would
be and delays in announcing the allocation prevented participants in the whiting fishery from planning their harvesting
and processing operations prior to the season. The industry was unable to plan ahead because it did not have a firm foundation
on which to base its business decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the problems the Council has identified and is seeking to solve are: Too much fishing and processing capacity
and not enough fish; inequitable distribution of economic benefits among the competing sectors; and regulatory
instability that has prevented the industry from making timely business decisions.

To resolve these problems, the Council identified the following priorities:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Ensure that [the] shore-based sector has reasonable opportunity to participate; (2) foster stability of shore-based
processing sector by providing replacement revenues for other faltering fisheries; (3) help stabilize faltering
rural coastal economies by providing fishing, processing and supporting industry revenues to replace income declines
in other industries; (4) achieve maximum net benefit to the nation by putting economic benefits directly into coastal
communities and distributing income impacts/benefits along traditional geographic paths; (5) spread fishery
over time and area, reducing potential pulse fishery impacts on whiting, salmon and rockfish stocks; (6) prevent
effort shift to other species; (7) address management of the entire groundfish resource rather than piecemeal; (8)
contribute to increased long-term product yield and employment opportunities by spreading harvest over a longer
season; (9) discourage additional capital investment in harvesting or processing facilities.

The Council convened an ad hoc industry subcommittee in July 1993 in Portland, Oregon, to develop an allocation option
that would be acceptable to all sectors. The subcommittee included a representative from each major sector in the
whiting industry: catcher vessels delivering at-sea, shoreside, and ``at-large;'' shoreside processors; catcher/processors;
and mothership processors. The ad hoc committee, after considering a number of alternatives, successfully negotiated
a 3-year agreement that was acceptable to all participants, and subsequently was adopted by the Council and recommended
to the Secretary (Option 1 in the EA/RIR or the proposed rule). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council's recommendation provides that the first 60 percent of the annual whiting harvest guideline will be available
to all vessels in open competition. The remaining 40 percent is reserved initially for shore-based activities. When
the 60 percent has been harvested, no further at-sea processing will be allowed for the remainder of the year or until
August 15, when an additional portion of the harvest guideline may be made available. NMFS will assess how much of the
harvest guideline will be utilized by shore-based processors during the remainder of the year, and any surplus to
shore-based needs will be made available to all permitted vessels on August 15. The allocation would remain in effect
for 3 years, 1994&hyph;1996. Any Pacific whiting harvested or processed in state ocean waters (0&hyph;3 nautical
miles offshore) will be counted toward the EEZ limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council also considered the alternatives of continuing the 1993 percentages (of 30 percent for vessels delivering
shoreside and 70 percent for at-sea processing (Option 2 in the EA/RIR), and continuing the ``olympic''-style fishery
with no allocations to either sector (Option 3 in the EA/RIR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ad hoc committee also reached a consensus agreement to assume that only the traditional whiting catcher fleet
(limited entry vessels with ``A'' permits) would be allowed to operate in the whiting fishery. The Committee believed
that the limited entry fleet, which contains approximately 40 catcher vessels from the traditional whiting fishery
and possibly one catcher/processor, is sufficient to harvest any likely harvest guideline for whiting in the next
3 years. However, NOAA cannot foresee what choices fishermen will make and cannot guarantee that the entire harvest
guideline will be taken by the current limited entry fleet. Participation in the limited entry fishery is determined
under Amendment 6 to the FMP, which allows for participation by vessels that are not in the current limited entry fleet
(by issuance of ``designated species B permits''), based on seniority in the fishery, if the current limited entry
fleet will not use the entire harvest guideline. Therefore, the FMP provides for temporary participation by vessels
that do not have ``A'' permits to ensure that the harvest guideline for whiting will be fully utilized.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The socio-economic framework in the FMP, under which this action is taken, requires the Council to consider a number
of factors in its recommendation to directly allocate the resource among users. (See section III.C.3 of the appendix
to 50 CFR part 663.) One factor that must be considered by the Council is ``any consensus harvest sharing agreement
or negotiated settlement between the affected participants in the fishery.'' However, the fact that an agreement
has been negotiated is not in itself a sufficient basis for the Secretary to approve the Council's recommendation.
The socio-economic framework also requires consideration of a number of biological, social, and economic factors,
as well as consistency with the goals and objectives of the FMP, the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. These factors
are more fully discussed in the Council's EA/RIR (see

and under certain conditions and assumptions (section 7.2.3 of the EA/RIR). The resulting ranges of estimated production

Biological and Environmental Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
No significant biological or environmental impact is expected as a result of the proposed rule. The bycatch of rockfish
and salmon is expected to be similar whether the proposed rule is implemented. Although it is possible that a short,
intense pulse fishery could have localized impacts on bycatch species, it also provides the potential for avoiding
species more likely to be caught at other times of year. The incentive to minimize bycatch may be less if the season is
short and vessels race to take their allocation. However, observers have been carried onboard both the at-sea processors
and shore-based catcher vessels for the purpose of monitoring bycatch. In general, bycatch rates of yellowtail rockfish
and Pacific ocean perch are more likely to increase if the fishery occurs predominantly in the northern areas, and
bycatch of bocaccio/chilipepper rockfish are more likely to increase if fishing occurs off California. A number
of regulations were implemented in 1993 for the purpose of minimizing bycatch of salmon and rockfish in the whiting
fishery (50 CFR 663.23(b)(3)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Council heard testimony that a later and longer season would benefit the whiting resource because the
fish would be larger later in the season and it would take fewer fish to fill the harvest guideline, the actual difference
in yield is small. An analysis conducted in 1992 indicated that even if the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
entire 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
harvest guideline were taken in September compared to April, the potential increase in yield would be about 10 percent.
This 10 percent would include increases to liver and gonad weight, and therefore is not likely to represent an equal
increase in marketable flesh. Since none of the options considered by the Council provided for the entire fishery
being taken in September, the increase in yield from an extended season would be less than 10 percent.

Economic Impacts

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The economic cost-benefit analysis developed by the Council for the 1993 allocation did not provide adequate information
to support any allocation decision. However, one more year of fishing and marketing experience, and revised data
were incorporated into a new analysis. Even though data were available in the recent analysis that did not exist at
the time the previous analysis was prepared, the results still should be interpreted with caution and are contingent
on assumptions about the effects of limited entry, and the quality of the data. However, given these limitations,
the Council's cost/benefit analysis does provide consistent ranking of the three options, suggesting that the proposed
rule may provide the greatest net economic benefit to the nation, even though the amount of that difference may be quite
small. In all instances the no allocation option (Option 3) was ranked lowest in terms of net economic benefit to the
nation. The differences between Options 1 and 2 were insignificant in most cases. Three important factors, based
on 1993 prices, appear to drive the results: (1) Shore-based headed and gutted operations are the most profitable
(highest net economic benefit); (2) shore-based waste utilization adds to the net economic benefit; and (3) surimi
prices are highest for catcher/processors. Applying the new data to assumed levels of participation by each sector,
and using observed prices, the total difference between the proposed rule and the no allocation option is only about
$3 million over the three-year period. Even though the exact dollar amount may not be known, this indicates a small
economic difference among the options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council concluded that although the net economic benefits are similar for Options 1 and 2, the no allocation (Option
3) was clearly inferior. In short, the cost-benefit analysis concluded that shore-based activities appear to produce
a slightly greater net economic benefit, in part due to the slower operating pace and to the multi-faceted nature of
the shore-based sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Council perceives a clearer difference between the options with respect to distributional effects,
believing maintenance of a robust shore-based whiting fishery is essential for the preservation of the social and

Social Impacts

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council believes that the proposed rule will provide the greatest stability to the harvesting and processing
communities. The Council is concerned about the impacts on traditional fishermen and the rural coastal communities
where they reside, focusing on those displaced by Americanization of the joint venture fisheries as well as those
displaced from other declining fisheries and industries. An integrated industry is important in dealing with severe
stock declines in other fisheries, most notably in the salmon industry, which also is stressing the shore-based processing
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the traditional whiting fishery must be viewed in the context of the overall groundfish fishery. Most
traditional whiting fishermen (those receiving ``A'' permits in the limited entry fishery) operate in other groundfish
fisheries as well. These fisheries have been managed under increasingly restrictive landing limits, and are harvested
near their levels of maximum sustainable yield (MSY), which means they cannot sustain additional effort. Of the three
options considered, Option 1 (the proposed rule) provides the greatest stability to the harvesting and processing
communities in part because it provides for the longest season for the shoreside sector (which could last until late
July/mid-October in 1994&hyph;1996) and should divert the greatest effort from other fully-utilized fisheries.
Diversion of effort from these other fisheries is intended to prolong their seasons, delay reductions in trip limits,
and maintain employment opportunities in both fishing and processing sectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, the catcher/processor trawl fleet entered the fishery off Washington, Oregon, and California in 1990
and has targeted only on whiting. Consequently, its participation in the whiting fishery does not divert effort from
other west coast fisheries, and, by taking the harvest guideline quickly, may reduce market opportunities for catcher
vessels that do not process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The no allocation option (Option 3) could encourage a brief fishery conducted primarily by at-sea processors, with
the entire harvest guideline being taken by the end of June. This would divert effort back to the other fully-utilized
groundfish fisheries, could accelerate the need for reduced trip limits in those fisheries, and result in shortened
seasons for the shoreside fishing and processing industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishing opportunities for the at-sea fleet also have been substantially reduced, particularly off Alaska and the
former Soviet Union, and therefore whiting has become more important to this fleet as well. The Council concluded
that the social and demographic description included in the December 1992 EA/RIR (prepared for the 1993 allocation
decision) clearly showed that the relative importance of whiting to the coastal communities exceeds the relative
importance to the Seattle metropolitan area where most of the at-sea processing fleet is based (although a large percentage
of employees are recruited from throughout the western United States). The Council agrees that neither sector should
receive a disproportionate amount of the harvest guideline, as could occur under the no allocation option (Option
3). It also believes that the greater national benefit will be derived by giving some protection to the traditional
catcher vessels that deliver to shore-based processors, and the communities in which they are based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although each of these options would influence participation by each sector, none of the options would preempt any
sector entirely. The social impacts of Option 1 upon the Seattle-based at-sea processing fleet are small relative
to those already occurring under the limited entry program. Because the fleet composition under the limited entry
program is still relatively unknown, undertaking a rigorous social analysis is premature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council also recommended Option 1 because industry consensus in support of this option indicated a willingness
to compromise that is unprecedented and should be encouraged.

Net Benefit to the Nation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the findings above, the Council found other compelling reasons to support the proposed rule and concluded
that it would provide the greatest net benefit to the nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 1 addresses concerns that there be equal sharing of the conservation burden between the at-sea and the shoreside
processing sectors. A percentage allocation more equitably shares between sectors both the conservation burden
when the harvest guideline is low, and the benefit when the harvest guideline is high. The harvest guideline in 1994
is much higher than previously expected, almost twice the 1993 level, but is expected to be lower in 1995 and 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though the tonnage available in 1994 is substantially higher than in 1993, additional overcapitalization is
not expected. The shore-based industry already is developed and the 104,000 mt reserve is close to the 100,000 mt estimate
of shoreside capacity in the EA/RIR. (Maximum annual harvest by shore-based whiting fishery was estimated at 134,000
mt in 1994&hyph;1996.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule, if implemented, would apply only for the next 3 years, a long-enough horizon for stability in planning,
but short enough to indicate to the public that the Council may reconsider this issue after the fleet has had a chance
to adjust to the limited entry program and whiting markets have stabilized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule is not a major departure from the approved 1993 allocation percentage of 30 percent for the shoreside
sector. The Council recommendation for 1994&hyph;1996 would give shoreside priority to 40 percent of the harvest
guideline, supplementing any amount taken during the olympic fishery for the first 60 percent. Also, with implementation
of the limited entry program, participation by the at-sea processing fleet may be much lower than in 1993, although
the exact level will not be known until the fishery occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reserve release assures that the harvest guideline will be fully utilized. The release date of August 15 is 2 weeks
earlier than in the past, and provides a longer opportunity for the at-sea fleet if a release is made to them. August
15 also coincides with the opening of the pollock ``B'' season in Alaska, and therefore would provide a more subdued
level of effort and a more orderly fishery than if the reserve were released much earlier or later in the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the above considerations, NOAA also has considered the Council's response to the following three questions
asked at the November 1993 Council meeting: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Why is allocating between the sectors by regulation superior to allowing the market to determine the shares between
sectors? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each of the sectors has the capacity to take a substantial portion, if not all, of the whiting harvest guideline in the
next 3 years. It is not clear if each would choose to do so given current low prices and uncertainty in the availability
of markets. The shore-based and at-sea sectors operate optimally at different rates, however, with the shore-based
component generally preferring a longer, slower fishery and the at-sea component best served with a relatively shorter,
more intense operation. Extended seasons at sea and on-shore actually enhance market opportunities for catcher
boats that would have their choice of markets. Furthermore, providing an opportunity for all sectors would divert
effort from other fully utilized fisheries that already are severely restricted. Additional effort into those fisheries
would have a cascading effect, causing earlier and/or more restrictive management measures and even greater stress
on shore-based processors of those species. (Whiting is the only trawl-caught species off Washington, Oregon, and
California that is processed offshore to any large extent.) Allowing the at-sea processing sector to even partially
preempt the shoreside sector would reduce national net benefits to the nation from the fishery and destabilize the
successfully developed shoreside economic infrastructure. Thus, there is ample justification to allocate between
sectors. The proposed rule would provide each sector with a reasonable opportunity to utilize this public resource.
However, if a sector does not need or intend to use its opportunity to the fullest extent possible, any unused portion
of the harvest guideline would be made available to the entire whiting fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Will this proposal encourage further capitalization in either sector? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
None of the options, including the preferred option, are expected to encourage further capitalization in either
sector. The at-sea and shore-based processing sectors and the catcher fleet are fully developed and are believed
to be capable of taking the proposed amounts. Even though the tonnage available in 1994 is substantially higher than
in 1993 (and is the highest level in the 3-year period under consideration), market prices for whiting currently are
at such low levels that it is unlikely that additional processing capacity would be attracted. At issue is the extent
that existing capacity will be utilized on whiting, other species, or not at all.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
With 104,000 mt reserved for shore-based operations in 1994, what are the net benefits to the nation from providing
an exclusive opportunity to the shoreside sector to use twice its historical level? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1993, the Secretary was concerned that the conservation burden of a reduced harvest guideline be equitably shared
among the sectors. Similarly, the benefit of an increased harvest guideline also should be equitably shared between
the sectors, particularly since it is not expected to result in increased capitalization, but rather in how effectively
the existing infrastructure is used. Thus, it would not be reasonable to limit the shoreside sector to only what they
processed in 1993 or any prior year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shoreside industry needs a longer operating window to be viable than the at-sea sector needs. Production by early
August will be a key component in determining if shore-based processors will need the entire reserve. Any unneeded
portion of the harvest guideline will be made available to the entire fishery on or about August 15, assuring there
is adequate time to conduct successful operations on the remainder of the harvest guideline. In 1992 and 1993, the
at-sea fleet was able to harvest considerably more than its initial allocation due to the release of whiting not needed
by shoreside processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The historical level of catch or production is not the only consideration. In 1993, both the shore-based and at-sea
processing fleets were constrained from catching as much whiting as they wanted. The 40 percent reserve recognizes
anticipated lower participation by catcher/processors in 1994 and beyond, consistent with implementation of the
limited entry program in January 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA has reviewed the Council's recommendation and supporting analysis and initially has determined that the proposed
rule is consistent with the Magnuson Act and its national standards and other applicable Federal laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA also requests comments on the advisability of releasing additional amounts of whiting after August 15, but only
if necessary to ensure full utilization of the harvest guideline.

This proposed rule is published under authority of the Magnuson Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 and was prepared at the request of the Pacific Fishery Management Council. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries,
NOAA (Assistant Administrator), has initially determined that this proposed rule is necessary for management of
the Pacific coast groundfish fishery and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for this proposed rule (contained in the EA/RIR), and concluded
that there would be no significant impact on the environment. A copy of the EA may be obtained from the Council (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed
rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the whiting fleet contains less than 20 percent of the total number of groundfish vessels, if this proposed
rule diverts effort from other traditional groundfish stocks, more than 20 percent of the fleet could potentially
be affected. However, none of the options is expected to have impacts that would qualify under any of the criteria for
determining ``significant'' impacts, nor would they force any small business entity to cease operation. In fact,
in comparison to the status quo, the proposed rule could result in greater fishing opportunities for non-whiting
vessels and thus increased revenues. For these reasons, it is determined that the proposed rule potentially would
affect a substantial number of small entities, but would not cause significant economic impacts on those entities.
Therefore, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) is not required. Also, the Council has requested that
this notice announce a correction to page 77 of the EA/RIR, the last sentence in the first paragraph, so that it reads:
``The Council concludes that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have significant effects on small entities
in 1994&hyph;1996.''

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS issues a proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Pelagic Fisheries of the
Western Pacific Region (FMP). This rule would replace a moratorium on the issuance of new permits for the Hawaii-based
longline fishery for Pacific pelagic management unit species. Under this rule, limited entry permits for the Hawaii
longline fishery would be issued to people meeting certain eligibility criteria. The rule also proposes broad framework
procedures for subsequent adjustment of the conservation and management measures for the pelagics fisheries intended
to provide for more efficient administration of the longline fishery. This rule also makes several technical changes
to the regulations. The proposed action is necessary to manage the longline fishery based in Hawaii to achieve optimum
yield from the fishery and prevent overfishing in accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act (Magnuson Act). Comments are solicited on this action; especially regarding the sufficiency of the upgrade limit
to control the longline fleet's growth and the adequacy of this measure to protect pelagic stocks and to prevent adverse
impacts on non-longline fishermen fishing for tuna and billfish, and to protect sea turtles.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FMP was prepared by the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and approved and implemented by
the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) at a time when there were few problems in the domestic fisheries for management
unit species (billfish and associated species). This is no longer the case. The longline fishery based in Hawaii targets
swordfish, tuna, and other management unit species, with vessels often traveling up to 2,000 miles (3,219 Km) from
port. Due to rapid growth of this fishery, prior to imposition of the 3-year moratorium on new participants, there
was concern about the potential and actual impact of the expanded fishery on the status of some fish stocks, the impact
of increased longline catches on other fisheries, and interactions between longline fishing and protected species
such as Hawaiian monk seals and sea turtles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council and Secretary have already taken several actions to address these concerns. They established a control
date for possible use in a limited entry program (56 FR 12891, March 28, 1991), issued an emergency rule establishing
a moratorium on new entry into the Hawaii-based longline fishery (56 FR 14866, April 12, 1991) and subsequently extended
the moratorium to midnight, April 22, 1994, by Amendment 4 to the FMP (56 FR 51849, October 16, 1991). Amendment 7 would
replace the moratorium and addresses a number of issues that are associated with the prospect of unregulated expansion
of the longline fishery. Increased level of longline fishing catches from the portion of the EEZ around Hawaii and
from adjacent high seas could result in overfishing of the stocks of Pacific pelagic management unit species throughout
their range, most notably swordfish. Even if stocks were not affected on a stock-wide basis, increased catches by
U.S. longline vessels could adversely affect other established fisheries, such as the commercial and recreational
handline and troll fisheries in the EEZ, as well as within the longline fishery. Further, even if direct catch competition
were not occurring, there would be considerable potential for market competition, both between the longline fleet
and the troll and handline fleets and within the longline fishery itself. Unregulated expansion of the longline fishery
could also increase the likelihood of adverse impacts on threatened and endangered species such as sea turtles, which
are known to be taken in the longline fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the restrictions (e.g., limitations on permit transfers and on vessel upgrading) under the moratorium,
in combination with area closures around the Northwestern and main Hawaiian Islands, which were imposed after the
moratorium went into effect, have been adversely affecting a number of people who had qualified for longline permits
under the moratorium. More than a quarter of the eligible fleet was inactive in 1992, due in many cases to the main Hawaiian
Island area closures that require vessels to travel 50 to 75 (81 to 121 Km) or more miles from shore to set their longline
gear. Some older and smaller vessels are unable to fish under these restrictions. Vessel owners have in some cases
been unable to sell or otherwise transfer their vessels or obtain financing for their fishing activity due to the ``one
transfer'' limit during the moratorium. In the Council's view, this has been an unintended negative effect of the
management program. Further, restrictions on the longline fishery outside the EEZ could have mixed effects on the
nation. The United States would benefit if the fishery could expand without adverse effects on fish stocks, other
fisheries, or protected resources and if foreign fleets were subject to similar restrictions. However, in the absence
of similar management of foreign fleets, restricting the U.S. fleet could disadvantage the United States in any future
negotiations leading to international regulation of longline fisheries and allocations of fish from the high seas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Amendment 7 is intended to improve the administration of the existing longline fishery management program.
The FMP also could be improved administratively. Existing framework procedures for regulatory changes are limited
in scope, and new framework procedures are proposed to simplify and expedite the implementation of new regulations
in particular instances without an FMP amendment. This is especially important for rapid response to new information
indicating problems with respect to stock conservation or conservation of protected resources.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hawaii longline limited entry permits would be required for longline vessels used to: (1) Fish for pelagic species
in the EEZ around Hawaii; or (2) land or transship pelagic species shoreward of the outer boundary of the EEZ around
Hawaii. The permits already required by existing regulations at 50 CFR 685.9 would be re-named ``longline general
permits'' and would be required for longline vessels around American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands or
other U.S. possessions in the Pacific Ocean, that are used to fish for, land, or transship pelagic species. Holders
of Hawaii longline limited entry permits would not need a separate general permit to longline, land, or transship
anywhere in the fishery management area (the waters off Hawaii and all the western Pacific territories and possessions),
or adjacent state waters. Receiving vessel permits would be required for vessels shoreward of the outer boundary
of the fishery management area that do not have longline gear on board and that land pelagic species or receive pelagic
species from other vessels. For purposes of 50 CFR part 685, ``land'' means to begin to offload, to arrive in port with
the intention of offloading, or to cause to be offloaded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following persons would be eligible for Hawaii longline limited entry permits: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The last holder of record for any longline vessel limited entry permit under the moratorium, provided the vessel
was used to land longline-caught management unit species in Hawaii at least once during the moratorium period; (2)
The last holder of record of a limited entry permit under the moratorium for a vessel less than 40 feet (12 m) in length;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The last holder of record of a limited entry permit obtained during the moratorium because that person also held
a limited entry permit for the NWHI crustaceans (lobster) fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 166 vessels are expected to qualify for permits under this program. Hawaii longline limited entry
permits would be freely transferable between vessel owners, provided the new vessel is not longer than the longest
vessel that had a longline limited entry permit and made landings during the moratorium period (about 93 feet (28 m)
to date). The vessel's length overall is defined in the proposed regulations and will be the measure of length used
in implementing this restriction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These measures are intended to allow vessel owners more freedom to either transfer their vessels or permits to other
prospective fishery participants or invest in larger vessels (up to the size of the largest vessel active in the moratorium
period) in order to resume operation in the fishery. Vessel owners would have more freedom to decide whether and how
to use their vessels and other resources. This is expected to result in a decrease in the number of smaller vessels and
an increase in the number of larger vessels. Overall effort is expected to increase over the actual effort that occurred
during the moratorium, with more effort directed at swordfish on the high seas. Landings of swordfish and tuna are
expected to increase, with the value of landings estimated to rise from about $45 million in 1992 to about $60 million
per year after fleet adjustments have been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment contains framework procedures to allow rapid responses to changing conditions, including biological
concerns for the stocks, economic problems in the fisheries, and potential harm to protected species under the Endangered
Species Act, such as sea turtles. This would simplify the implementation of needed changes in the management program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-permitted U.S. longline vessels could enter the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the Council's area of concern
and ports shoreward of the EEZ with longline-caught fish on board provided the longline gear is stowed or secured.
These vessels would not be allowed to offload management unit species shoreward of the outer boundary of the EEZ. These
measures are intended to relieve economic strains now faced by longline vessel owners in Hawaii due to present limitations
on permit transfers and vessel upgrades. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 685.23 would be removed because the 5-year review was completed in 1992 and this section is therefore no longer
applicable. It was noted that pelagic fisheries had changed dramatically and that more frequent evaluation of the
effectiveness of management was necessary. Several amendments to the FMP already had been implemented to address
new issues. The Council now prepares an annual report on this fishery under the FMP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also proposes to add three fish species to the management unit (moonfish, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lamprus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
spp.; pomfret, Family Bramidae; and oilfish, Family Gempylidae). The definition of overfishing applied to other
Pacific Pelagic Management Unit Species (excluding sharks) would apply to the species added to the management unit.
This would ensure that collection of catch and effort data will be comprehensive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the definition of protected species zone would be revised to correct a drafting error when the zone was
created 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(56 FR 52214, October 18, 1991). The current definition leaves open to longline fishing a corridor between Laysan
Island and Lisianski Island. The intent of the Council in establishing the protected species zone was to provide a
continuous closed corridor around the NWHI in which longline fishing would be prohibited to protect Hawaiian monk
seals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule would eliminate &sect;685.26, which has procedures for changing longline fishing prohibited areas, because
the new framework procedures in &sect;685.18 would encompass the procedures for changing longline fishing prohibited
areas.

A consultation was conducted by NMFS under the Endangered Species Act in 1993 to determine if the fishery, as it was
being managed under the FMP at that time, would jeopardize the continued existence of sea turtles. A Biological Opinion
and Incidental Take Statement were issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 10, 1993, that indicated the fishery is not likely to adversely affect any endangered or threatened species of
sea turtle, nor will it adversely affect any critical habitat of any listed sea turtle species during the 1-year term
of the Opinion. An incidental take of 752 turtles was established. Several conservation recommendations and reasonable
and prudent measures were included in the Opinion and Statement, which are in an Appendix to this Amendment 7. Through
complementary actions, the Council has also concurred with establishment of a mandatory observer program and an
electronic vessel monitoring system requirement for the longline fishery. These measures were included in the Opinion
and Statement. The proposed amendment will be evaluated for compliance with the Biological Opinion during the public
review process for Amendment 7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conservation of sea turtles is a special concern. In the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement, NMFS
included a conservation recommendation that the FMP be amended to preclude increases in longline effort until it
is demonstrated that the take of turtles is being managed at a level that will not preclude recovery of the species.
Amendment 7 would establish a cap on potential harvesting capacity by allowing vessel upgrades only to the size of
the largest vessel active in the moratorium period. The amendment indicates that it is likely there will be some shift
to larger vessels on average, and that larger vessels generally deploy fewer hooks per set than small vessels. Effort
is not expected to increase above that which would have occurred if all the vessels in the fleet had been active in the
moratorium. As noted, the amendment also proposes framework measures to allow rapid regulatory response to new information,
including indications of need for management changes for protected resources. In separate actions, the Council
has concurred with establishment of a mandatory observer program and a vessel monitoring system requirement. In
the Council's view, these measures taken together are sufficient to control growth of the longline fishery and address
future conservation problems with new actions, if necessary, and the amendment complies with the Biological Opinion
and incidental take statement. NMFS specifically solicits comments on this issue.

Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires the Secretary to publish regulations proposed by a Council within
15 days of receipt of the amendment and regulations. At this time, the Secretary has not determined that Amendment
7 is consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. In making
that determination, the Secretary will take into account the data, views, and comments received during the comment
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is not subject to review under E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council prepared a combined draft FMP amendment/Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) covering the impacts
of the fishery as managed under this amendment and alternative approaches. The final amendment/final EIS satisfies
NEPA requirements for documentation and analysis of the impacts of the fishery on the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A consultation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was conducted in 1993 and NMFS issued a Biological
Opinion (Opinion) and Incidental Take Statement (Statement) in June 1993 concerning the take of sea turtles in the
longline fishery. The Opinion concluded that the fishery, as managed by the FMP at that time, is not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of the species during the one-year period of the Opinion. An incidental take of 752 turtles
was set for the one year during which the Opinion is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule, if adopted, is expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Hawaii longline vessel owners (approximately 166) will have more flexibility to buy and sell vessels and permits
and to upgrade their fishing vessels to compete more effectively in the domestic longline fishery, as well as with
foreign fleets. It is estimated that total revenue from longline landings would increase to $60 million per year from
about $45 million in 1992. The final amendment/FEIS also is written to serve as an IRFA intended to satisfy the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule includes changes in an information collection previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OMB No. 0648&hyph;0204). A request for approval of these modifications and extension of the collections is included
in a request submitted by the Southwest Region, NMFS, for approval of modification and extension of that collection
that covers all Southwest Region fishery permit programs. The proposed program would require prospective participants
in the Hawaii longline fishery to submit permit application forms and supporting information, including a current
Certificate of Documentation from the U.S. Coast Guard, to obtain a permit under the new limited entry program. Landings
records from the existing Hawaii longline logbook reporting requirement will be used to determine whether an individual
has met any landings requirement to qualify for a permit. The estimated burden on the applicants is 30 minutes per application.
This is less than the average of 1 hour or more that had been required for applications for permits in the moratorium
period because those applications often involved documentation demonstrating intent to enter the longline fishery
at a time when investment decisions were made. The documentation requirements under the new permit program will be
simpler. This rule also restates requirements for the submission of logbooks and post-landing notifications. These
requirements have already been approved by OMB under Control Number 0648&hyph;0214. The response times for these
requirements were estimated to be 5 minutes per day for the logbook and 5 minutes per notification. Send comments regarding
these burden estimates or any other aspect of these collection-of-information requirements, including suggestions
for reducing burden, to the Director of the Southwest Region, NMFS, and to OMB (see

Introduction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 New management measures may be added, through rulemaking, if new information demonstrates that there are biological,
social, or economic concerns in the fishery. The following framework process allows for measures that may affect
operation of the fisheries, gear restrictions, quotas, or reductions or increases in longline catch and/or effort
if the information supports such a change. Additional information may indicate the need for new management measures
for other sectors of the fishery, such as harvest guidelines, permits for certain classes of vessels, or reporting
requirements.

Assessment of the fisheries.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 By June 30 of each year, the Council-appointed Pelagics Plan Team will prepare an annual report on fisheries in the
fishery management area, containing the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Fishery performance data (e.g., landings, effort, value of landings, species composition); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Summary of recent research and survey results; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Habitat conditions and recent alterations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Enforcement activities and problems; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Administrative action (e.g., data collection and reporting, permits); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) State and territorial management actions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Assessment of need for Council action (including biological, economic, social, enforcement, administrative,
and state/Federal needs, problems, and trends). Indications of potential problems warranting further investigation
may be signaled by indicator criteria. These criteria could include, but are not limited to, important changes in:
Mean size of the catch of any species; estimated ratio of fishing mortality to natural mortality for any species; decline
in catch per unit effort by any sector; ex-vessel revenue of any sector; relative proportions of gear in and around
the EEZ; rate of entry/exit of fishermen in the fisheries; revenues for a significant percentage of any sector; total
pelagic landings; species composition of the pelagic landings; research results; habitat or environmental conditions;
or level of interactions between pelagic fishing operations and protected species in the EEZ or surrounding waters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Recommendations for Council action; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Estimated impacts of recommended action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recommendations for management action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The annual report shall specify any recommendations made by the Pelagics Plan Team to the Council. Recommendations
may cover actions suggested for Federal regulations, state/territorial action, enforcement or administrative
elements, and research and data collection. Recommendations will include an assessment of urgency and the effects
of not taking action and will indicate whether changes involve existing measures, which may be changed under paragraph
(c) of this section, or new measures, which may be implemented under paragraph (d) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure for changing established measures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Established measures are those that are or have been in place via rulemaking procedures for various sectors of
the fisheries, including, but not limited to: General longline fishery permits; limited entry longline fishery
permits; longline logbooks and other reporting requirements; longline area closures; and longline gear marking
requirements. The estimated and potential impacts of these measures have been evaluated in past FMP amendments and
associated documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Council will identify problems that may warrant action. This may be through the annual report described in
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or a separate report from the Pelagics Plan Team, the Advisory Subpanel, Pelagics
Review Board, Scientific and Statistical Committee, pelagic fishery sector, enforcement officials, NMFS or other
sources. The Council will discuss at its next meeting whether changes to established conservation and management
measures would resolve the problem. Notice to the public and news media preceding the meeting will indicate that the
Council intends to discuss and possibly recommend regulatory adjustments through the framework process for established
measures to address the issue or problem. The notice must summarize the issue(s) and the basis for recommending the
measures being reviewed and would refer interested parties to the document(s) pertaining to the issue. Based on the
discussions at the meeting, which could include participation by the Pelagics Plan Team, Advisory Subpanel, Pelagics
Review Board, Scientific and Statistical Committee, or other Council organizations, the Council will decide whether
to recommend action by the Regional Director. The Regional Director will be asked to indicate any special concerns
or objections to the possible actions being considered under the framework process and, if there are any concerns
or objections, will be asked for ways to resolve them.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) If the Council decides to proceed, a document will be prepared describing the problem and the proposed regulatory
adjustment to resolve it. The document will demonstrate how the adjustment is consistent with the purposes of the
established measure and that the impacts had been addressed in the document supporting the original imposition of
the measure. The document will be submitted to the Regional Director with a recommendation for action. The Council
may indicate its intent that the recommendations are to be approved or disapproved as a single action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the Regional Director approves part or all of the Council's recommendation, the Secretary, in accordance with
the Administrative Procedure Act, may implement the approved change in an established measure by publishing a final
rule, waiving advance notice and comment. This does not preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional
opportunity for advance notice and comment, but contemplates that the Council process will satisfy the requirements
of the Magnuson Act and Administrative Procedure Act. It is emphasized that established measures are measures that
have been evaluated and applied in the past, and adjustments are meant to be consistent with the original intent of
the measure and within the scope of analysis in previous documents supporting the existing measure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(e) of
the Magnuson Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure for implementing new measures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) New measures are those that have not been used before or measures that, while previously applied, would be applied
to another fishing sector (e.g., non-longline pelagic fishery) or gear type for the first time. New measures may have
been previously considered in a past FMP amendment or document, but the specific impacts on the persons to whom the
measures would newly apply have not been evaluated in the context of current conditions. Potential new measures include,
but are not limited to: Permit requirements for new fishery sectors; reporting requirements for a fishery sector
other than longline fishing; effort limitations; quotas (for total catch or by species) including individual transferable
quotas; fractional licensing; or bycatch limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A Pelagics Plan Team report (annual report or an in-season report), input from advisors, or input from NMFS or other
agencies will first bring attention to a problem or issue that needs to be addressed at the next Council meeting. In
its notice announcing the meeting, the Council will summarize the concern or issue raised, the party that has raised
the problem, and the extent to which it is a new problem or a problem that may require new management measures. The Council
will seek to identify all interested persons and organizations and solicit their involvement in discussion and resolution
of this problem through the Council process, and the Council meeting notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will emphasize that this problem will be discussed and that proposed actions may result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The document presenting the problem to the attention of the Council will be distributed to all advisory bodies
of the Council who have not yet received it, with a request for comments. The document also will be distributed to the
Council's mailing list associated with the FMP to solicit inputs and to indicate the Council will take up action at
the following meeting. The Council's chairperson may request the Council's Pelagics Standing Committee to discuss
the issue and review the comments (if any) of the Pelagics Plan Team, Advisory Panel, Pelagics Review Board, or Scientific
and Statistical Committee, and develop recommendations for Council action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) At the meeting, the Council will consider the recommendations of its Pelagics Standing Committee, if any, and
other Council organizations and will take comments from the public concerning the possible course of action. If the
Council agrees to proceed with further action under the framework process, the issue will be placed on the agenda for
the following meeting. A document describing the issue, alternative ways to resolve the issue, the preferred action,
and the anticipated impacts of the preferred action, will be prepared and distributed to the public with a request
for comments. A notice will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 summarizing the Council's deliberations and preferred action and indicating the time and place for the Council meeting
to take final action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In its notice for the following meeting, the Council will indicate that the Council may take final action on the
possible adjustment to regulations under this section. At the meeting, the Council will consider the comments received
as a result of its solicitation of comments and take public comments during the meeting on the issue or problem. The
Council will consider any new information presented or collected and analyzed during the comment period. The Regional
Director will be provided a specific opportunity to indicate any objections or concerns about any or all components
of the measures being considered. The Council then will decide whether to propose a new measure or measures under this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the Council decides to proceed, the Council will submit its proposal to the Regional Director for consideration
with supporting rationale and an analysis of the estimated biological, economic and social impacts of the proposed
actions. The Council may indicate its intent that all components of its recommendations be approved or disapproved
as a single action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If the Regional Director concurs in whole or in part, the Secretary, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure
Act, may implement the approved new measure by publishing a final rule, waiving advance notice and comment. Nothing
in this procedure is intended to preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional opportunity for advance
notice and comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, but contemplates that the Council process (which includes two Council meetings with opportunity for public comment
at each) will satisfy that requirement.

(8) If a new action is approved and implemented, future adjustments may be made under the procedure for established
measures.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Forest Service proposes to make certain lands within the Lewis and Clark National Forest administratively available
for oil and gas leasing, subject to constraints specified in the 1986 Lewis and Clark National Forest Land and Resource
Management Plan. The Forest Service also proposes to authorize the BLM to offer those lands for lease, subject to specified
stipulations. Both the administratively-available decision, and the leasing decision for specific lands are being
made. The BLM will decide whether to offer the specific lands for lease subject to the Forest Service ensuring that
correct stipulations will be attached to leases issued by BLM. In cases where the surface resources are not managed
by the federal government but the minerals are federally owned (split estate), the BLM will also decide whether or
not to offer these mineral rights for lease and what stipulations to apply. Except where stipulations prohibit all

obtaining an approved Surface Use Plan of Operations from the Forest Service in accordance with 36 CFR, subpart E,

The EIS will examine the effects of the proposal to implement the oil and gas leasing direction in the 1986 Lewis and
Clark Forest Plan and additional alternatives. The primary purpose of this analysis is to determine which lands should
be available for leasing, what stipulations should be applied to any leases, and which specific lands should be offered
for lease at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lands affected are within the boundaries of the Lewis and Clark National Forest. These lands encompass several mountain
ranges south and east of Great Falls, Montana (including the Little Belt, Highwood, Castle, north Crazy, Big and Little
Snowy Mountains), as well as the eastern Front Range of the Rocky Mountains west of Choteau, Montana. By regulation,
several classes of National Forest System lands are considered legally unavailable for leasing at this time, and
will be considered unavailable for lease under all alternatives in the analysis. On the Lewis and Clark Forest, these
lands include existing wilderness, specifically the Bob Marshall-Scapegoat Wilderness complex. Also unavailable
are those lands recommended for wilderness in the Lewis and Clark Forest Plan, which includes about 51,800 acres on
the Rocky Mountain Division adjacent to the Bob Marshall and Scapegoat Wildernesses. These lands are described in
the Lewis and Clark Forest Plan as the Renshaw, South Fork and West Fork of the Teton, and Silver King-Falls Creek areas.
In addition, lands proposed for wilderness study under the Montana Wilderness Study Act (Pub. L. 95&hyph;150) are
not available for oil and gas leasing. This includes 92,000 acres in the Middle Fork of the Judith River Wilderness
Study Area in the Little Belt Mountains, and 98,000 acres in the Big Snowy Mountain Wilderness Study Area.

This analysis is required by the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1987 and implementing regulations
promulgated in 1990 (36 CFR 228.102).

The Lewis and Clark Forest Plan provides direction for the use of stipulations to be attached to leases in order to comply
with Forest Plan goals and objectives. As outlined in the Forest Plan, no-surface occupancy (NSO) is recommended
for lands where oil and gas development could conflict with riparian values, wetlands and floodplains, as well as
on slopes greater than 60%. The Forest Plan calls for no-surface occupancy to protect existing uses such as powerlines,
irrigation canals, and cemeteries, and developed recreation sites, as well as the area above Gibson Dam on the Sun
River. Areas identified in the Forest Plan as Research Natural Areas also require the NSO stipulation. The Ford Creek
Plateau area on the Rocky Mountain Division would be available only for no-surface occupancy leasing for the first
decade of the Forest Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Plan also identifies areas for which timing restrictions on activity would be stipulated to protect resource
values such as threatened and endangered species habitat, sensitive species habitat, big game seasonal ranges,
and raptor nest sites. NSO is recommended in areas where more than one key wildlife habitat is present and the combined
seasons of use leaves no opportunity for oil and gas occupancy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Lewis and Clark Forest Plan identifies resource concerns requiring special operating constraints,
such as landtypes susceptible to moderate-severe cut-bank failure potential, semi-primitive recreation areas,
Experimental Forests, and municipal watersheds. A stipulation controlling surface use would be applied to leases
with these resource concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Forest Plan, stream segments eligible for ``wild'' status under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 will
not be offered for lease. Most of these stream segments are within existing wilderness areas, but on those segments
outside of designated wilderness on Forest, lands unavailable for lease include areas within 1/4 mile either side
of segments of the South Fork of the Sun River, the Dearborn River, and North Fork Birch Creek.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public participation will be important to the analysis. Part of the goal of public involvement is to identify additional
issues and to refine the preliminary issues identified above. People may visit with Forest Service officials at any
time during the analysis and prior to the decision. However, two periods are specifically designated for comments
on the analysis: (1) During the scoping process and (2) during the Draft EIS (DEIS) comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the scoping process, the Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State, and local
agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. A scoping
document will be prepared and mailed to parties known to be interested in the proposed action by February 25, 1994.
The agency invites written comments and suggestions on this action, particularly in terms of identification of issues
and alternative development. In addition, public open houses will be held during the scoping period: on Monday, February
28 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Kings Hill Ranger District Office in White Sulphur Springs, MT; on Wednesday, March 2,
from 6 p.m. until 9 p.m. at the Great Falls Civic Center in Great Falls, MT; on Monday, March 14, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at
the Holiday Inn in Missoula, MT; on Tuesday, March 16, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Little Flower Parish in Browning, MT;
and on Wednesday, March 17, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Choteau Public Library in Choteau, MT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the proposed action, a range of alternatives will be developed in response to issues identified during
scoping. This includes the no-action alternatives required by NEPA in which no leasing would be authorized at this
time. The Forest Service will analyze and document the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of all alternatives.
Stipulations will be developed to mitigate effects and protect other resources, and the effectiveness of those stipulations
will be assessed.

The BLM and Forest Service are jointly preparing a Reasonably Foreseeable Development (RFD) scenario to predict
the level and type of oil and gas activity anticipated to occur for the 10&hyph;15 year period following leasing. The
RFD is based on known geologic, economic, and technical information for the local area. This RFD will be used to analyze
the effects of the proposed action and alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service will continue to involve the public and inform interested and affected parties on how to participate
and contribute to the final decision. Another formal opportunity for response will be provided following completion
of a Draft EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Draft EIS should be available for review in the fall of 1994. The Final EIS is scheduled for completion in September
1995.

The Forest Supervisor for the Lewis and Clark National Forest has been assigned the task of compiling the EIS. However,
the officials responsible for making the decision resulting from the analysis are: David F. Jolly, Northern Region
Regional Forester, Federal Building, 200 E. Broadway, P.O Box 7669, Missoula, MT 59807; and State Director, USDI-Bureau
of Land Management, Montana State Office, 222 North 32nd Street, P.O. Box 36800, Billings, MT 59107&hyph;6800.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They will decide on an alternative to be implemented after considering comments and responses, environmental consequences
discussed in the Final EIS, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The decision and reasons for the decision
will be documented in a Record of Decision.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so it is meaningful and
alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions (

or dismissed by the courts.

this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so substantive comments and objections
can be made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider and respond to them in the Final
Environmental Impact Statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
during the scoping period should be as specific as possible. Initial comments concerning the scope of the analysis
should be mailed to John D. Gorman, Forest Supervisor by March 31, 1994. When the Draft EIS is released, it is also helpful
if comments refer to specific pages or chapters in the draft document. Comments may also address the adequacy of the
Draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer
to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

On April 27, 1990, Roque A. Muracciole (hereinafter referred to as ``Muracciole'') was convicted in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of Florida_Miami Division of two counts of violating the Export Administration Act
of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C.A. app. &sect;&sect;2401&hyph;2420 (1991, Supp. 1993, and Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;10,
March 27, 1993)) (the ``EAA''), by possessing a controlled U.S.-origin computer with knowledge that it was intended
for export to Bulgaria, and by preparing a falsified invoice with the intent to evade the provisions of the EAA. Section
11(h) of the EAA provides that, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce,

(1991, Supp. 1993, and Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;10, March 27, 1993)) (the EAA), by exporting U.S.-origin aviation oil
from the United States to Cuba without obtaining the required export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Section 11(h) of the EAA provides that, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 no person convicted of a violation of the EAA, or certain other provisions of the United States Code, shall be eligible
to apply for or use any export license issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA or the Export Administration Regulations
(currently codified at 15 CFR parts 768&hyph;799 (1993)) (the Regulations), for a period of up to 10 years from the
date of the conviction. In addition, any export license issued pursuant to the EAA in which such a person had any interest
at the time of his conviction may be revoked.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 8437) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on rice from Thailand
(51 FR 12356; April 10, 1986). The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance with section
751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the preliminary results of review, respondent, the Royal Thai Government (RTG), filed a case brief. All comments
received are addressed in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments, the Department recalculated loans made under the EPC program and the ACFT program using
the 1989 benchmark rate instead of the 1990 benchmark rate for short-term loans received in 1989 but repaid in 1990.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department adjusted the net benefit to the millers under the Ministry of Interior (MOI) paddy price raising program.
This adjustment results in a revised benefit to the millers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent, the Royal Thai Government (RTG), contends that only the USA Rice Council (USA Rice), by letter dated April
29, 1991, requested this administrative review, and that the Department's preliminary determination that this
review was initiated upon request of an interested party under 19 CFR 355.2(i)(5) is not supported by substantial
evidence on the record of this review. Further, respondent argues that there is no evidence on the record of this review
that the Rice Millers Association (RMA), the original petitioner in this proceeding, timely requested a review during
the anniversary month of the publication of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department accepted the USA Rice/RMA letter dated April 29, 1991, as being a request for review on behalf of both
USA Rice and RMA because all the statements in the letter were made collectively and the names and addresses of contact
individuals at both organizations were provided. To determine whether USA Rice had standing as an interested party
in this proceeding, the Department in its letter of May 2, 1991, requested information from USA Rice regarding the
function of USA Rice, the eligibility requirements for membership, and the number of members classified as importers,
producers or sellers of rice. By letter of May 13, 1991, USA Rice provided the requested information as well as copies
of their bylaws, articles of incorporation, and their annual report covering the period of review (POR). Based on
the information provided by USA Rice, the Department determined that USA Rice is an interested party to this proceeding.
Further, by letter dated June 7, 1991, the Department asked that RMA clarify its intent to request a review jointly
with USA Rice. RMA's affirmative response of June 7, 1991 was treated not as a request for review, but as a clarification
of RMA's intent. For these reasons, the Department treated the request for this administrative review to be jointly
from USA Rice and RMA.

Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent contends that in its preliminary determination, the Department wrongly rejected the short-term loan
benchmark developed by the Bank of Thailand (BOT) and erred in using the benchmark methodology adopted in Final Affirmative
Countervailing Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order; Steel Wire Rope from Thailand (56 FR 46299; Sept.
11, 1991), (Steel Wire Rope).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent argues that the Department failed to address new evidence and arguments submitted by the RTG in the questionnaire
responses on the record of this review which show that the BOT benchmark methodology is more representative of short-term
commercial lending rates in Thailand than the Department benchmark methodology used in Steel Wire Rope. The respondent
explained that the BOT compiles a database from monthly balance sheets and semi-annual income statements submitted
by Thai commercial banks from which the BOT calculates a weighted-average commercial interest rate for short-term
borrowing. Respondent asserts that this BOT benchmark has been consistently used in all Thai cases previous to Steel
Wire Rope and was most recently verified in the 1989/90 administrative review of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings
from Thailand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent also argues that the Steel Wire Rope benchmark is premised on a misunderstanding of the minimum loan rate
(MLR) and minimum overdraft rate (MOR). Respondent asserts that the MLR and MOR are merely an indication of the commercial
bank's prospective short-term lending rates, and that banks are free to make commercial loans below either the MLR
or MOR. Commercial banks usually indicate high MLRs because certain loans cannot be made in excess of their MLRs. Further,
the MOR carries a higher interest rate than regular loans and is used only when a loan has not been repaid by its due date.
The MLR and MOR are ``prime'' rates from the perspective of the commercial banks, and exporters, as secured borrowers
repaying in hard foreign currencies, often receive commercial loans at rates below these rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, respondent contends that the MLR and the MOR do not reflect the actual lending practices of commercial
banks, and the Department should instead use the BOT benchmark to recalculate the benefits from all short-term loan
programs found countervailable in this review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered all the information submitted in respondent's questionnaire responses which explain
in detail the methodology and sources of information used to calculate the BOT benchmark. However, using the data
submitted by the respondent in the responses resulted, as it did in the final determination and order in Steel Wire
Rope, in a BOT benchmark which was lower than the average of the monthly prime rates (MLRs and MORs) as compiled by BOT
from commercial banks and published in the 1990 BOT Quarterly Bulletin, and less even than the interbank lending rate
reported in the government's response. Contrary to respondent's assertions that the MLR and MOR are merely indications
of the commercial bank's prospective short-term lending rates, throughout the BOT Annual Report and Quarterly Bulletins,
the MORs and MLRs are reported both as commercial banks' interest rates to prime customers or as prime rates (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BOT 1990 Annual Economic Report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at p. 51 and 55; and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
December 1990 BOT Quarterly Bulletin
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, at p. 12 and Table 22, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
p. 32). Also, the prime rates are published in the BOT Annual Report under Thailand's Key Economic Indicators at page
one. Further, it was found in Steel Wire Rope, that most of the commercial bank's short-term loans were made at the MOR/MLR
rates. This is confirmed by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1990 BOT Quarterly Bulletin
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Table 12 at p. 17 and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BOT Annual Economic Report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at p. 53. Finally, because the interbank lending rate is the rate at which a commercial bank obtains its funds, the BOT
benchmark, which is less than the interbank lending rate reported in the government's response, demonstrates unmistakably
that the BOT benchmark does not reflect commercial realities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these facts, the Department is not persuaded that the information submitted by respondent on the record of
this review more accurately reflects the actual interest rates for commercial short-term financing in Thailand
than the published MLR and MOR. Therefore, we determine that it is appropriate to continue to use the average of the
MOR and the MLR as our benchmark interest rate in these final results of review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Respondent contends that the Department should apply the 1989 benchmark rate to the benefit calculations for loans
made under the EPC program in 1989 and repaid in 1990. Respondent argues that this methodology matches the appropriate
benchmark rate to the time when the terms of the loans, including the interest rates, were set. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department's practice is to select a benchmark interest rate at the time the government and the firm agree on the
terms of the loan, which in this case was when the loan was received. (See, e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing
Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order; Steel Wire Rope from Thailand) (56 FR 46299, September 11, 1991).
Therefore, we agree that the 1989 benchmark rate should be used for calculating the benefit of EPC loans received in
1989 but on which interest was paid in 1990 and have recalculated the benefit from this program. The revised net subsidy
from this program is 0.32 percent

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 3:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Respondent claims the Department did not follow its recent practice of accounting for EPC loans with repayments made
both during and outside the review period. Respondent argues that, in calculating the benefit from this program,
the Department should include the entire loan if partial repayments are made before and during the review period and
exclude the entire loan if repayments are made during and after the review period. RTG specifically requested corrections
to be made to 22 loans with payments both inside and outside the review period.

 The Department disagrees with respondent. According to our practice as expressed in section 355.48(b)(3) of our
Proposed Rules, (54 FR 23384, May 31, 1989), the benefit from a loan occurs when a firm is due to make a payment on the loan.
The questionnaire response clearly states that in the case of EPC pre-shipment loans, the entire loan must be repaid
in full within two days of shipment, whether or not this occurred before the due date on the note. Further, in the case
of EPC post-shipment financing, the loan must be repaid on the earlier of the date on which the loan was due or the payment
for the shipment was received. In both types of loans, provision is made only for the payment of the entire loan and no
provision is made for partial payments. Therefore, we consider each payment listed in the questionnaire response
to be a repayment of a separate loan and according to our practice, have countervailed all those loans repaid within
our POR or with penalties refunded during the POR.

Comment 4:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Respondent contends that the loan disbursements from three domestic price stabilization programs_CPD loans to
ACFT, BAAC Paddy Mortgage Program and BOT Agricultural Purchase Project_should be allocated over the crop-year
during which the funds were available rather than allocated entirely during the calendar year covered by the review.
Respondent argues that the allocation of the disbursements should be made by calculating a ratio of crop-year months
falling within 1989 to total crop-year months which includes months in both 1989 and 1990. For calculating the benefit
from this program, the 1989 benchmark should be used for the portion of loans equivalent to the ratio of months falling
in 1989 and the 1990 benchmark used for the portion of loans equivalent to the ratio of months falling in 1989.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees in part. The questionnaire response shows all CPD loans to ACFT, the provincial federations,
and district-level cooperative societies were disbursed in 1989 and repaid in 1990. Therefore, we have adjusted
our calculations to reflect the use of the 1989 benchmark rate of 12.23 for loans disbursed under this program (see
Comment 2). The revised net subsidy under this program is 0.05 percent

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the RTG allocated the funds to BAAC and BOT in 1989 at the beginning of the crop year, respondent submitted
no information as to when the individual loans to farmers under these programs were disbursed by the BAAC and BOT. Therefore,
we continue to consider the aggregate amount of BAAC and BOT loans to be disbursed and repaid during the POR.

Comment 5:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Respondent asserts that the Department's best information available (BIA) rate imposed on the four companies not
submitting EPC loan information is overly punitive. Respondent argues that a more reasonable method for calculating
the benefits for this program should be adopted because complete EPC loan information was submitted for eight companies
accounting for 95.31 percent of rice exports to the United States for which EPCs were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In its questionnaire, the Department requested information on all EPCs granted, paid, or on which interest was paid
or due on rice exports to the United States during the POR. In its supplemental questionnaire, the Department requested
complete loan information for all 12 companies exporting to the United States who utilized EPCs during the POR. Respondent
submitted complete loan information for only eight of the 12 companies but stated in their supplemental questionnaire
response that the loan charts for the four exporters would be submitted as soon as they were available to counsel. No
loan information was submitted for the four companies. Section 776(c) of the Act requires the Department to use BIA
whenever a party refuses or is unable to produce the information requested. Furthermore, &sect;355.37 of the Department's
regulations gives the Department broad discretion in the use of BIA to calculate benefits for non-cooperating companies
who do not submit a complete response. In light of respondent's failure to respond to our request for complete loan
information, we are continuing to use the highest individual company benefit found in this review to calculate the
benefit of the four companies not submitting complete responses. However, in accordance with our utilization of
different benchmarks for 1989 and 1990 loans

Comment 6: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent contends that the Department's application of section 771B of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19 U.S.C. Sec. 1677&hyph;2, is in error and, absent an upstream subsidies investigation, the Department has no authority
to countervail any of the paddy rice (paddy) price support and stabilization programs in this review. Respondent
argues that at harvest, the RTG intervenes in the market to purchase paddy from paddy farmers at prices above prevailing
market prices and holds the paddy off the market until prices improve. Although this practice serves to increase the
price received by paddy farmers, it increases the millers' cost of paddy, thereby decreasing the competitiveness
of milled rice, the exported product, in the U.S. and world markets. Therefore, an upstream subsidies investigation
would show that the price support and stabilization programs for paddy rice provide no competitive advantage to milled
rice, the exported product, and therefore are not countervailable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, respondent argues that the Department should determine whether 771B is relevant to the paddy rice purchase
programs by reexamining the following four factors: (1) Paddy growers and rice millers are not related and there is
no commonality of economic interest_in fact, their economic interests are adverse; (2) rice processing adds more
than limited value; (3) there can be no circumvention of the order because both paddy rice and milled rice are included
in the scope of the order and product shifting is impossible; (4) the processing operations (milling) change the essential
character of the paddy rice from an inedible raw fiber to an edible grain and create the added value, whether measured
by price or essential characteristics. In light of these facts, respondent claims that it would be inappropriate
to apply section 771B to the paddy rice purchase programs insofar as such programs serve only to raise the price of the
exported milled rice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department disagrees with Respondent's contention that, absent an upstream subsidy investigation, the Department
has no authority to countervail the paddy rice support and stabilization programs in this review. In this review,
the Department determines that the criteria of 771B of the Act are satisfied, and as such need not apply an upstream
subsidy analysis with respect to subsidies on raw agricultural products used in the production of processed agricultural
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department disagrees with Respondent's claim that Commerce has deemed four factors relevant to
determining which agricultural subsidies are subject to section 771B's provisions. Respondent extracts its four
factors from Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Live Swine and Fresh, Chilled and Frozen Pork
Products from Canada, (50 FR 25098, June 17, 1985) (Live Swine), a determination which predates section 771B by several
years. While the Live Swine determination may have provided the genesis for section 771B, it is not dispositive in
the Department's application and interpretation of the superseding statutory provision, particularly in cases
involving other products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Department disagrees with Respondent's argument and reasoning that the domestic paddy purchase programs
should not be countervailed because they increase milled rice export prices, decreasing the competitiveness of
Thai rice in the United States and world markets. By raising the farm income of poor paddy farmers and stabilizing a
domestic paddy market, the programs ensure a continuous, level supply of paddy rice for domestic millers. A drop in
the supply of paddy due to either seasonal low levels of paddy production or a decrease in the number of paddy farmers
could compel Thai millers to source paddy abroad at even higher prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to enactment of section 771B, the Department considered a benefit to producers of a raw agricultural product
as a benefit to producers of a processed agricultural product. See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination
and Countervailing Duty Order; Rice From Thailand, (51 FR 12356, April 10, 1986) (Rice). In Rice we determined that
``the primary, if not sole purpose of all segments of the industry in the case is to produce a single end product_milled
rice.'' We also noted that almost all of the raw agricultural product, paddy or unmilled rice, is dedicated to the production
of milled rice, and determined that there is a single, continuous line of production from paddy rice to milled rice.
Rice, at 12358. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1313 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 amended the Tariff Act of 1930 to include a new section
771B that states: ``In the case of an agricultural product processed from a raw agricultural product in which (1) the
demand for the prior stage product is substantially dependent on the demand for the latter stage product, and (2) the
processing operation adds only limited value to the raw commodity, subsidies found to be provided to either producers
or processors of the product shall be deemed to be provided with respect to the manufacture, production, or exportation
of the processed product.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this review, we determine that the first criterion of section 771B is met because the demand for paddy rice depends
substantially upon the demand for milled rice. As in Rice, we find in this review that substantially all of the raw agricultural
product, paddy rice, is dedicated to the production of milled rice. As determined in Rice, the fact that there is a single,
continuous line of production from paddy rice to milled rice is further evidence that the demand for the prior stage
product is dependent on the demand for the latter stage product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Furthermore, as in Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review; Rice From Thailand (56 FR 68, January
2, 1991) (Final), we determine that the second criterion of 771B, limited value added, is also satisfied in this review.
Respondent would have us consider the difference between paddy rice and milled rice in terms of price as the focus in
determining value added. The statute, however, requires us to consider the processing operation in determining
value added for the purposes of 771B. Notably, the bulk of value added in terms of price reflects supply and demand conditions
in the world market for rice and includes selling costs and profits in addition to the cost of milling or processing
operations. In this case, the processing operations consist primarily of parboiling the paddy rice, removing the
rice hulls, and removing the bran layer. The resulting processed agricultural product, milled rice, while not identical
to the raw agricultural product, paddy rice, is essentially unchanged in composition. As a result, the Department
determines that the processing operation itself adds only limited value to the raw commodity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, we determine that subsidies found to be provided to paddy rice shall be
deemed to be provided with respect to the manufacture, production, or exportation of milled rice in accordance with
section 771B of the Act.

Comment 7: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent claims that in order to receive interest-free loans under the MOI's loan program, millers are required
by the Government to buy paddy from farmers at prices approximately ten percent above prevailing market prices. Therefore,
respondent argues that the gross benefit from the loans should be reduced by ten percent, as authorized under section
771(6) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purpose of determining the net subsidy, section 771(6) of the Act allows the administering authority to subtract
from the gross subsidy the amount of ``(A) any application fee, deposit, or similar payment paid in order to qualify
for, or to receive, the benefit of the subsidy, (B) any loss in the value of the subsidy resulting from the deferred receipt,
if the deferral is mandated by Government order, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of merchandise to the United States specifically intended
to offset the subsidy received.'' Our practice is to interpret this section of the Act very narrowly, and we determine
that the requirement to buy paddy at prices above prevailing market prices is not an offset provided for under section
771(6).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, in order not to double-count the subsidy conferred upon the subject merchandise under this program, we have
adjusted our preliminary calculations. Under this program, the MOI required rice millers to purchase rice from farmers
at a price ten percent above the prevailing market price. To partially cover the additional payments to the farmers,
the MOI provided interest-free loans to the rice millers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In our preliminary results of review, we calculated a countervailable subsidy under this program based on the ten
percent government-mandated price premium paid to the rice farmers. If we were also to calculate a benefit from the
interest-free loans provided to the millers to finance this program, we would be double-counting the benefit conferred
on the subject merchandise under this program: once, as grant payments provided to rice farmers, and again as the amount
of interest savings incurred by the millers from the interest-free loans used to pay the rice farmers the price premium
grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to avoid this double-counting, and to calculate properly the full amount of the subsidy conferred upon the
subject merchandise under this program, we compared the amount of the ten percent premium paid for paddy rice purchases
to the amount of the interest savings from the MOI loans. Because the amount of the interest savings was greater than
the amount of the premiums paid on purchases of paddy rice, both the rice farmers and the millers received benefits
under this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since section 771B of the Act applies to this review, the benefits provided to both rice farmers and millers are deemed
to be conferred on the subject merchandise. (See Comment 6 for a discussion of section 771B of the Act.) Therefore,
to determine the net benefit to the millers under this program, we calculated the difference between the amount of
interest savings under this program and the ten percent premium provided to the rice farmers. This change results
in a revised benefit to the millers under this program. The benefit to the paddy farmers remains the same as in the preliminary
results. Thus, by dividing the sum of these two benefits by the domestic denominator and applying the export adjustment
factor, the net subsidy conferred upon the subject merchandise under this program is 0.02 percent

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the period January 1, 1990 through December 31, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailing duties of 0.53 percent of the
f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments from Thailand of the subject merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1990
and on or before December 31, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to collect
cash deposits of estimated countervailing duties of 0.53 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of the
subject merchandise from Thailand entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication
of this notice. This deposit requirement shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NIST invites interested members of the public to review validation requirements that have been developed for products
that implement FIPS PUB 140&hyph;1, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. NIST plans to establish a
product certification program using independent third party laboratories to validate cryptographic modules for
conformance to the security requirements of FIPS 140&hyph;1. The requirements for certification will be finalized
after the proposed procedures, inspections and tests for conformance have been determined. A National Voluntary
Laboratory Accreditation Program will be set up to accredit the third party laboratories at an appropriate future
time. At this time, NIST solicits public review of the proposed procedures, inspections, and tests that will be used
and the expected results to be achieved in the validation of cryptographic modules.

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss strategic issues that relate to the development of the Single Integrated Operational
Plan (SIOP). Full development of the topics will require discussion of information classified TOP SECRET in accordance
with Executive Order 12356, 2 April 1982. Access to this information must be strictly limited to personnel having
requisite security clearances and specific need-to-know. Unauthorized disclosure of the information to be discussed
at the SAG meeting could have exceptionally grave impact upon national defense. Accordingly, the meeting will be
closed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. App II Para 10(d) (1976), as amended.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Navy, with the Department of Energy as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a cooperating agency, announces its intent to prepare an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), and to conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a series of public scoping meetings. This Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement will address final disposal of decommissioned, defueled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor plants from cruisers and OHIO (Trident) and LOS ANGELES 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(SSN 688) Class submarines and will analyze the associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts. The disposal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future reactor compartments from vessels that have not yet been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commissioned (e.g., SEAWOLF Class of submarines) will be addressed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as appropriate, in future National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents. By participating as a cooperating agency in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impact Statement, the Department of Energy expects to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be able to adopt this Environmental Impact Statement, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate, to fulfill its environmental review obligations under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Environmental Policy Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Policy Act regulations, the Department of the Navy is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparing this Environmental Impact Statement to focus on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for significant environmental impacts and to consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the common design characteristics of the reactor plants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and their reactor compartments, the method currently being used by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington to dispose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submarine reactor compartments is the preferred alternative for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of the defueled reactor plants from cruisers and OHIO and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LOS ANGELES Class submarines. Briefly, this alternative would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve draining the piping systems, tanks, vessels, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components to the maximum extent practical, sealing the radioactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems, removing the reactor compartment and sealing it to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a high integrity welded steel package. The reactor compartment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
package would be transported by barge out of Puget Sound through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Straits of Juan de Fuca, down the Washington coast, and up the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia River to the Port of Benton where it would be loaded onto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an overland transporter for the short movement to the Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy's low level radioactive waste burial grounds at Hanford, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reactor plants contain radioactivity due to neutron irradiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of structural alloys forming the reactor plant components. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor compartment packages would comply with the shipping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container requirements of the Department of Transportation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disposal of the reactor compartments would be in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Energy requirements for low level radioactive waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal. Disposal of the reactor compartments would be regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the State of Washington due to the lead shielding contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the reactor compartments and by the U.S. Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Protection Agency due to the small quantity of polychlorinated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biphenyls in materials within the reactor compartment such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insulation, electrical cables, and rubber parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Navy also will evaluate in detail a ``no action'' alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this alternative, the defueled ships would be maintained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waterborne protective storage for an indefinite period of time at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the inactive ships facilities at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Norfolk Naval Shipyard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other alternatives will be examined. These alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include sea disposal, land disposal at other sites, land disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or reuse of subdivided portions of the reactor plant, and above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground storage or disposal.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Navy placed the world's first nuclear powered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submarine, the NAUTILUS, into service in 1954. The first nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powered cruiser, the LONG BEACH, was commissioned in 1961. As of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of 1993, the U.S. Navy had 106 nuclear-powered submarines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 15 nuclear-powered surface ships in operation. Today, over 40% 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Navy's principal combatants are nuclear powered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the end of their useful lifetime, when the cost of continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation is not justified by their military capability, or when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are no longer needed, the defueled reactor compartments from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these ships require disposal. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Navy evaluated a number of options for disposing of the pre-LOS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANGELES class nuclear powered submarine reactor compartments as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ships were beginning to approach the end of their design life. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options examined included disposal of the reactor compartment at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing land burial site, with the non-radioactive remainder of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the submarine disposed of either by sinking at sea or by cutting up 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for sale as scrap metal, and disposal by sinking the entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submarine in the deep ocean. The ``no action'' alternative of long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term protective storage also was examined. The Navy's 1984 Final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that permanent disposal would be environmentally safe and feasible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using either the land burial or deep ocean option. The Record of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decision issued by the Secretary of the Navy stated that ``No 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unacceptable environmental impacts associated with either option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been identified as a result of the analysis or through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public review process'', and that ``Based on consideration of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current factors bearing on a disposal action of this kind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemplated, the Navy has decided to proceed with disposal of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor compartments by land burial.'' The Navy has successfully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursued this course of action and, as of the end of 1993, has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safely shipped 35 submarine reactor compartments to the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Energy's burial grounds at Hanford, Washington.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today the Navy faces the necessity of downsizing the fleet to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent that was not envisioned before the end of the Cold War. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the next few years a number of major surface combatants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including nuclear powered cruisers, will be removed from service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some LOS ANGELES Class submarines are scheduled for removal from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service. Eventually, the Navy will also need to decommission OHIO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class submarines. These classes of nuclear powered ships were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in the 1984 Environmental Impact Statement. The total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of cruiser, OHIO, and LOS ANGELES Class reactor compartments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is approximately 100. The purpose of this Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement will be to assess the potential environmental impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposing of defueled reactor compartments from nuclear powered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cruisers and the LOS ANGELES and OHIO Class submarines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Preliminary Description of Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Preferred Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the common design characteristics of the reactor plants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and their reactor compartments, the method currently being used by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington to dispose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submarine reactor compartments is the preferred alternative for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of the defueled cruiser, OHIO and LOS ANGELES Class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor plants. Briefly, this alternative would involve draining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the piping systems, tanks, vessels, and other components to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum extent practical, sealing the radioactive systems, removing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reactor compartment and sealing it to provide a high integrity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
welded steel package, and transporting the package first by barge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up the Columbia River and then a short distance over land to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Energy's low level radioactive waste burial grounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at Hanford, Washington. The reactor compartment packages would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed in a trench, backfilled with earth, and covered by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engineered cap to minimize future water infiltration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. No Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This alternative would involve keeping defueled nuclear powered ships in waterborne protective storage for an indefinite
period of time. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Norfolk Naval Shipyard have inactive ships storage facilities for
defueled nuclear powered ships. Rather than temporarily storing the ships until their reactor compartments can
be removed, the ``no action'' alternative would result in a much larger number of ships in storage. This option would
require periodic ship inspections as well as performance of drydocking preservations. If no permanent disposal
alternative is available, the ``no action'' alternative will occur by default. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Other Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several other alternatives will be examined including the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The detailed evaluation of sea disposal contained in the Navy's 1984 Environmental Impact Statement will be used
and updated in this Environmental Impact Statement to take into account the number and radioactivity content of the
cruiser, OHIO, and LOS ANGELES Class reactor compartments. The 1984 Environmental Impact Statement concluded that
sea disposal could be performed in an environmentally safe manner with no significant adverse effect. However, the
1984 Record of Decision noted that Congress passed an amendment which restricted the issuance of permits for sea disposal
of radioactive material and required Congressional approval before such a permit could be issued, and the Environmental
Protection Agency stated that additional regulations may be required before a permit request could be reviewed.
Also, in November 1993, the United States voted along with the majority of other signatories to the London Convention
to ban sea disposal of low level radioactive waste subject to a scientific review in 25 years. Therefore, this alternative
would now be precluded by treaty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disposal sites other than the Department of Energy's burial site at Hanford will be considered for disposal of reactor
compartment packages. Criteria to be considered in site evaluation will include availability of barge unloading
facilities, navigability of waterways, bridge clearances, and overland transport requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Land disposal or reuse of subdivided portions of the reactor plant would involve the cutting up of the defueled reactor
plant into smaller pieces. This option would require evaluation of locations and methods to dismantle and package
the reactor plant components and determination of appropriate locations and methods for final disposal or reuse
of the resulting subdivided portions of the reactor plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Placement of the reactor compartments above ground in specially designed buildings or in an arid environment will
be evaluated as an interim storage measure, and as a permanent disposal method. As in the case of the burial option,
the above ground storage evaluation will consider the long term migration potential of long lived radionuclides.

Preliminary Identification of Environmental Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following issues, subject to consideration of comments received in response to public scoping, have been tentatively
identified for analysis in the Environmental Impact Statement. This list is presented to facilitate public comment
on the scope of the Environmental Impact Statement. It is not intended to be all inclusive nor is it intended to be a predetermination
of impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Potential impacts to the public and on-site workers from radiological and non radiological releases caused by
activities to be conducted within the context of the proposed action and alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Potential environmental impacts, including air and water quality impacts, caused by the proposed action and alternatives.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Potential transportation impacts as a result of the proposed action and alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Potential effect on endangered species, floodplain/wetlands, and archeological/historical sites as a result
of the proposed action and alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Potential impacts from postulated accidents as a result of the proposed action and alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Potential socioeconomic impacts to the surrounding communities as a result of implementing the proposed actions
and alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Potential cumulative impacts from the proposed action and other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Potential irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources.

Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on February 8, 1994, Distrigas of Massachusetts (DOMAC) with an office at 200 State Street, Boston
Massachusetts 02109, filed in Docket No. CP91&hyph;2243&hyph;002 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act and
part 157 of the Commission's regulations an application for an amendment to the certificate of public convenience
and necessity issued by the Commission in this Docket on December 3, 1991 (

, 57 FERC &para; 61,295, 1991;

clarified 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FERC &para; 61,297 (March 18, 1992)). The December 3 Certificate authorized DOMAC to install additional vaporization
capacity and appurtenant facilities at DOMAC's liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Everett, Massachusetts.
That Certificate, as clarified, required DOMAC to complete construction of the authorized facilities by March 18,
1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of intervening developments and changes in DOMAC's original market projections, installation of the certificated
facilities by the March 18, 1994, in-service date is no longer warranted by current market demand. Accordingly, given
the substantial lead times needed to complete design and to obtain needed equipment, DOMAC requests that the December
3 Certificate be amended to remove the in-service date. In place of a specific in-service date, DOMAC requests that
the certificate require DOMAC to file with the Commission by March 31, 1995, final design specifications and evidence
that final equipment orders have been placed. Timing of completion of the certificated facilities will thus depend
on the completion and delivery of the required equipment and will not require further intervention by the Commission
to precisely tailor the certificate to the delivery dates for that equipment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on February 9, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG) P.O. Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed
in Docket No. CP94&hyph;221&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate
of public convenience and necessity authorizing WNG to replace approximately 20 feet of 20-inch transition pipeline
and, upon replacement, to hydrotest and increase the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) of the Blackwell,
Oklahoma to Hesston, Kansas segment of WNG's system, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, WNG states that in order to increase the MAOP of the Blackwell to Hesston portion of its pipeline system
approximately 20 feet of 20-inch pipeline, in five four-foot sections, must be replaced. WNG states that the pipe
replacement and subsequent uprating will give WNG the capability to transport increased volumes of gas to the Wichita
market center. WNG further states that the increased MAOP will also enhance service reliability and flexibility
by increasing WNG's ability to shift demand volumes between the north and south portions of its pipeline system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WNG states that the proposed replacement and uprating will cost approximately $222,000, which will be paid from funds
on hand.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on February 9, 1994, Arkla Energy Resources Company (AER), P.O. Box 21734, Shreveport, Louisiana
71151, filed a prior notice request with the Commission in Docket No. CP94&hyph;222&hyph;000 pursuant to Section
157.205 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to construct and operate
a one-inch delivery tap in St. Francis County, Arkansas, under AER's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;384&hyph;000,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and deliver natural gas under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP88&hyph;820&hyph;000, pursuant to
Section 7 of the NGA, all as more fully set forth in the request which is open to the public for inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AER proposes to construct and operate a one-inch delivery tap in St. Francis County, Arkansas, for the delivery of
natural gas to Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company's (ALG) customer, James E. Knox. AER would deliver approximately 85
Mcf of natural gas annually and one Mcf on a peak day. AER states that Mr. Knox would reimburse AER for the estimate $1,600
in construction costs for the proposed delivery tap. AER also states that it would transport gas to ALG and provide
service under its Order No. 636 restructured rate schedules, the volumes would be within ALG's certificated entitlements,
and AER's tariff allows the addition of new delivery points.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
KNI states that the Tyrone System, located in Beaver and Texas Counties, Oklahoma and Seward County, Kansas, was constructed
in 1953. KNI indicates that the system was constructed even though it was isolated from the rest of its system. It was
also indicated that adequate reserves could not be purchased adjacent to its main pipeline system. KNI states that
gas purchased by KNI was delivered from the Tyrone System to third parties for ultimate redelivery to KNI on its mainline
system. KNI advised that over time its reliance upon the supplies connected to the Tyrone System diminished and, as
a result, KNI released all of the gas supplies it had under contract along the Tyrone System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is indicated that because the Tyrone System was isolated and distant from its mainline system and was no longer needed
to move its system supplies, K N transferred its facilities upstream of the Tyrone Plant to GPM but did not transfer
the residue lines connecting the plant with the three downstream interstate transporters. The Commission approved
this abandonment by sale by order issued August 4, 1993, in Docket No. CP92&hyph;661&hyph;000 and also determined
that the upstream facilities were non-jurisdictional gathering lines. KNI also states that, upon acquisition of
the Tyrone gathering facilities, GPM began using these facilities to gather gas for delivery to its own processing
plants. It is then indicated that, as a result, gas no longer flowed to the Tyrone Plant for processing and for ultimate
delivery into KNI's residue lines. It is also stated that, subsequently, the owner of the Tyrone Plant sold the plant,
and removed the facility from the plant site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KNI states that, with the removal of the Tyrone Plant, the residue lines are no longer usable to KNI. KNI now seeks to
transfer these facilities to GPM. It is indicated that pursuant to a memorandum of understanding, KNI would receive
the net book value of the residue lines ($36,000 as of October 31, 1993) in return for the transfer of facilities to GPM.
KNI states that by abandoning the remainder of the Tyrone System facilities, it would eliminate the expense and inefficiencies
associated with the isolated facilities.

Take notice that on February 9, 1994, Arkla Energy Resources Company (AER), 1600 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002,
filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;223&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Commission's Regulations
to operate an existing interconnection with Oklahoma Natural Gas (ONG) to deliver natural gas in Custer County, Oklahoma
under AER's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;384&hyph;000, pursuant to section 7 of the Natural
Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AER proposes to convert an existing receipt interconnection, consisting of a six-inch tap and check valve with a maximum
delivery capability of approximately 125,000 MMcf of natural gas per day, located on AER's Line AD in Custer County,
Oklahoma into a delivery interconnection. AER proposes to make minor above-ground changes to the check valve, install
an electronic flow computer, modem and phone service to permit the reversal of the gas flow and allow deliveries to
ONG for transportation services pursuant to &sect;284.223 of the Commission's Regulations. AER states that ONG
owns and operates the meter and would reimburse AER for the cost of the facilities estimated to be $8,000.

Southern states that the purpose of this filing is to set forth additional known and measurable GSR costs which have
been paid or incurred by Southern since the filing on December 1, 1993, of its first GSR cost recovery filing in Docket
No. RP94&hyph;67&hyph;000. Southern states that it sets forth in this filing the revised demand surcharges and revised
interruptible rates that will be charged in connection with its recovery of GSR costs associated with the reformation
of additional gas supply contracts that have become unnecessary and/or unmarketable as a result of the receipt by
Southern of revised service elections from its customers following the mandatory restructuring by Southern of its
pipeline services under Order No. 636. Southern requests that the tariff sheets be made effective on March 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern states that it seeks to recover $53.9 Million in GSR costs which has been paid or incurred in connection with
the reformation of four gas supply contracts. Southern states that these GSR costs have arisen as a direct result of
the need to realign gas supply contracts following customers' elections during restructuring to terminate their
sales entitlements under Order No. 636. Southern further states that none of the GSR costs sought to be recovered in
the instant filing constitute take-or-pay settlement costs under gas supply contracts existing at March 31, 1989
which would be subject to the provisions of Southern's 1988 take-or-pay settlement in Docket No. RP86&hyph;63&hyph;000.

25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.

Take notice that on February 14, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), tendered for filing
as part of its FERC Gas Tariffs, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1 and Original Volume No. 2, revised tariff sheets listed on
appendix A to the filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern states that on December 30, 1993, Texas Eastern filed tariff sheets in Docket No. TM94&hyph;4&hyph;17&hyph;000,
to be effective February 1, 1994, to reflect changes in Texas Eastern's projected expenditures for electric power
for the twelve month period beginning February 1, 1994, based upon actual expenditures for the twelve month period
ending October 31, 1993 (``EPC Filing'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern states that on January 28, 1994, the Commission issued an order on the EPC Filing in Docket No. TM94&hyph;4&hyph;17&hyph;000
which accepted and suspended, effective February 1, 1994, the proposed tariff sheets, subject to the Commission's
receipt and review of certain additional information to be filed by Texas Eastern (``January 28 Order''). Texas Eastern
states that it is providing the required information and filing certain tariff sheets, listed on appendix A of the
filing, which reflect the various rate components for EPC costs included in incremental services and the exclusion
from the EPC tariff provision of those Rate Schedule FT&hyph;1 services approved on an incremental basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets is February 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern states that copies of its filing have been served on all firm customers of Texas Eastern, current Rate
Schedule FT&hyph;1 and IT&hyph;1 shippers and interested state commissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Regulatory Commission, 825 North
Capitol Street NE, Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with &sect;385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.
All such protests should be filed on or before February 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this
filing are on a file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.

Take notice that on February 14, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), tendered for filing
as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, the tariff sheets listed on appendix A of the filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern states that on December 30, 1993, Texas Eastern filed certain tariff sheets: (1) Pursuant to ordering
paragraph (C) of the Commission's order issued October 29, 1993, in Docket No. RP93&hyph;204&hyph;000, to implement
a small customer mitigation methodology, and (2) to flow through a rate refund received from Columbia Gulf Transmission
Company. These tariff sheets reflected a proposed effective date of October 31, 1993. By Commission order issued
January 28, 1994, (January 28 Order) such tariff sheets were accepted and suspended to be effective January 1, 1994,
subject to Texas Eastern refiling the sheets to revise the billing amounts prospectively, for the remainder of the
amortization period, so as to adjust for the differences between the new allocations and the amounts already billed
to customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern states that pursuant to and in compliance with the January 28 Order, Texas Eastern is refiling the tariff
sheets listed on appendix A of the filing. In the December 30, 1993, filings, Texas Eastern states it contemplated
a twelve (12) month amortization period for these billing amounts beginning October 31, 1993. Texas Eastern has already
billed its customers for the months of November 1993, December 1993 and January 1994 according to First Revised Sheet
Nos. 165, 166 and 167. As a result, the tariff sheets listed on appendix A which are effective January 1, 1994, show that
the Account No. 858 Stranded Cost Direct Bill commences on January 31, 1994, because January 31, 1994, is the first
day of the next unbilled amortization period (February 1994). Texas Eastern states that this is purely an administrative
matter resulting from the billing process and will not affect amounts previously billed for the months of November
1993, December 1993 and January 1994. Attachment A of the filing illustrates the calculation of the new principal
amount by customer for the remaining nine (9) month amortization period in accordance with the January 28 Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets listed on appendix A of the filing is January 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern states that copies of the filing were served on Texas Eastern's jurisdictional customers and interested
state commissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before February 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the
proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

Texas Eastern states that it is making the instant filing to clarify tariff inconsistencies called to Texas Eastern's
attention by the Commission Staff in connection with a January 25, 1994, technical conference in Docket No. TM94&hyph;2&hyph;17.
Staff indicated that Section 15.6(A) could be read as meaning that all Rate Schedule FT&hyph;1 services are subject
to the ASA provision. Texas Eastern states that it is filing Sub Fourth Revised Sheet No. 633 to clarify that certain
incremental services, including ITP, are not subject to the ASA provision and to further clarify the definition of
``Applicable Shrinkage Percentages''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, Staff pointed out that Section 15.6(A) listed Rate Schedules LLFT, LLIT, VKFT and VKIT, also incremental
rate schedules, as ASA Rate Schedules in Section 15.6(A). Pursuant to Commission orders authorizing these services,
Rate Schedules LLFT, LLIT, VKFT, and VKIT should be and were intended to be defined as Non-ASA Rate Schedules, as shown
on currently effective Sheet No. 130 of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1. Texas Eastern
states that it is filing Sub First Revised Sheet No. 633 and 1st Rev Second Revised Sheet No. 633 to eliminate these Rate
Schedules from the listing of ASA Rate Schedules. Such tariff sheets are to be effective October 1, 1993 and October
3, 1993, the effective dates of Rate Schedules LLFT and LLIT and VKFT and VKIT, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, as Staff pointed out at the technical conference, the reference to ``ASA Reservation Charge Surcharge''
in Section 15.6(E) of Texas Eastern's tariff should read ``ASA Usage Surcharge.'' Texas Eastern states that it is
filing Sub Original Sheet No. 636 to make this modification. In addition, Texas Eastern states that it is filing 2nd
Sub Original Sheet No. 634 to correct an error in the page reference in Section 15.6(A)(2).

Take notice that on December 16, 1993, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company (Williston Basin), tendered
for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Original Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheet:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 13, 1993, Williston Basin submitted for filing its compliance filing in Docket No. RP94&hyph;48&hyph;001.
The filing was made in compliance with the Commission's December 3, 1993, Order to reflect the annual principal amount
(plus interest) of the ten percent of Gas Supply Realignment Transition Costs as an allocated costs attributable
to interruptible transportation service provided under Rate Schedule IT&hyph;1 and the removal of the facilities
transferred by Williston Basin to Koch Hydrocarbon Company from Williston Basin's rate base.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon further review of its December 13 filing, Williston Basin noticed that Forty-ninth Revised sheet No. 11B contains
an inadvertent error. Rate Schedule X&hyph;13 should not have reflected the take-or-pay throughput surcharge of
21.251 cents per Dkt. Williston Basin is therefore submitting herewith a corrected, Sub Forth-ninth Revised Sheet
No. 11B, to replace Forth-ninth Revised Sheet No. 11B submitted on December 13, 1993. The change to this tariff sheet
has no effect on any other rates.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Energy Information Administration (EIA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent
burden (required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), conducts
a presurvey consultation program to provide the general public and other Federal agencies with an opportunity to
comment on proposed and/or continuing reporting forms. This program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided
in the desired format, reporting burden is minimized, reporting forms are clearly understood, and the impact of collection
requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, EIA is soliciting comments concerning the proposed
revision of Form EIA&hyph;871A, ``Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, Building Questionnaire,''
to collect information on Federal government buildings using EIA&hyph;871A (FS), ``Commercial Buildings Energy
Consumption Survey, Building Questionnaire, (Federal Supplement).''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In order to fulfill its responsibilities under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Pub. L. No. 93&hyph;275)
and the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. No. 95&hyph;91), the Energy Information Administration is
obliged to carry out a central, comprehensive, and unified energy data and information program. As part of this program,
EIA collects, evaluates, assembles, analyzes, and disseminates data and information related to energy resource
reserves, production, demand, and technology, and related economic and statistical information relevant to the
adequacy of energy resources to meet demands in the near and longer term future for the Nation's economic and social
needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form EI&hyph;871A, ``Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, Buildings Questionnaire'' collects information
about energy characteristics and related energy consumption and expenditures in commercial buildings. These data
are used for energy modelling and forecasting. Specifically, the data to be obtained by the Form EIA&hyph;871A (FS)
will assist in measuring the potential for energy savings in Federal buildings, pursuant to the requirements of Section
152 through 167 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Form EIA&hyph;871A (FS) will collect data on Federally-owned buildings.
Data will be collected on building size, principal building activity, physical characteristics of the building
and energy-related equipment, energy sources used and related energy end uses. The data collected will be similar
to that previously collected by EIA for commercial buildings using Form EIA&hyph;871A ``Building Questionnaire''.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This is a revision of an existing collection. Modifications to the existing Form EIA&hyph;871A ``Building Questionnaire''
include eliminating questions that are not related to Federal buildings or to EPACT requirements and adding several
questions related to: water heating, energy audits conducted by the DOE Office of Federal Energy Management Programs,
and energy consumption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Prospective respondents and other interested parties should comment on the actions discussed in item II. The following
general guidelines are provided to assist in the preparation of responses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a potential respondent: A. Are the instructions and definitions clear and sufficient? If not, which instructions
require clarification? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Can the data be submitted using the definitions included in the instructions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Can data be submitted in accordance with the response time specified in the instructions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Public reporting burden for this collection is estimated to average 27 minutes per respondent. Given that this
survey will be conducted by telephone, how much time do you estimate it will require you to review the advanced letter
mailed to you, gather the necessary data needed (square footage of building, year constructed and annual energy consumption)
and respond to the telephone interview which includes questions about the physical characteristics of the building
and energy-related equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. What is the estimated cost of completing this form, including the direct and indirect costs associated with the
data collection? Direct costs should include all costs, such as administrative costs, directly attributable to
providing this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. How can the form be improved? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. Do you know of any other Federal, State, or local agency that collects similar data? If you do, specify the agency,
the data element(s), and the means of collection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a potential user: A. Can you use data at the levels of detail indicated on the form? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. For what purpose would you use the data? Be specific. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. How could the form be improved to better meet your specific needs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Are there alternate sources of data and do you use them? What are their deficiencies and/or strengths? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. For the most part, information is published by EIA in U.S. customary units, e.g., cubic feet of natural gas, short
tons of coal, and barrels of oil. Would you prefer to see EIA publish more information in metric units, e.g., cubic meters,
metric tons, and kilograms? If yes, please specify what information (e.g., coal production, natural gas consumption,
and crude oil imports), the metric unit(s) of measurement preferred, and in which EIA publication(s) you would like
to see such information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EIA is also interested in receiving comments from persons regarding their views on the need for the information contained
in the form EIA&hyph;871A (FS), ``Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, Building Questionnaire (Federal
Supplement)''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB approval of
the form; they also will become a matter of public record.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Assistance grants are awarded to States eligible for Federal disaster assistance. FEMA regulation 44 CFR
Part 13, Uniform Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments, places certain
requirements on the State in its role as grantee for the Public Assistance Program, which includes monitoring and
reporting program/project performance. States are required to submit progress reports on a quarterly basis which
describe the status of those projects and any problems or circumstances expected to result in noncompliance with
the approved grant conditions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Acting under the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990, 15 U.S.C. 2201 note, the United States Fire Administration
has worked with each State to compile a national master list of all of the places of public accommodation affecting
commerce located in each State that meet the requirements of the guidelines under the Act. FEMA published the national
master list in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on Tuesday, November 29, 1993, 58 FR 62718, and published changes approximately monthly since then. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parties wishing to be added to the National Master List, or to make any other change, should contact the State office
or official responsible for compiling listings of properties which comply with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act.
A list of State contacts was published in 58 FR 17020 on March 31, 1993. If the published list is unavailable to you, the
State Fire Marshal's office can direct you to the appropriate office. Periodically FEMA will update and redistribute
the national master list to incorporate additions and corrections/changes to the list, and deletions from the list,
that are received from the State offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each update contains or may contain three categories: ``Additions;'' ``Corrections/changes;'' and ``Deletions.''
For the purposes of the updates, the three categories mean and include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Additions'' are either names of properties submitted by a State but inadvertently omitted from the initial master
list or names of properties submitted by a State after publication of the initial master list; ``Corrections/changes''
are corrections to property names, addresses or telephone numbers previously published or changes to previously
published information directed by the State, such as changes of address or telephone numbers, or spelling corrections;

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board has determined to assess a penalty fee on the average daily daylight overdrafts in Federal Reserve accounts
incurred by bankers' banks that do not maintain reserves, Edge and agreement corporations, and limited-purpose
trust companies. The rate for the daylight overdraft penalty fee is equal to the regular daylight overdraft rate applicable
to other institutions plus 100 basis points, quoted on a 24-hour basis, for a 360-day year, and adjusted for the length
of the Fedwire operating day. The penalty fee should create an incentive for institutions that do not have regular
discount window access to avoid incurring daylight overdrafts in Federal Reserve accounts.

A bankers' bank is a financial institution that is not required to maintain reserves under the Board's Regulation
D (12 CFR part 204) because it is organized solely to do business with other financial institutions, is owned primarily
by the financial institutions with which it does business, and does not do business with the general public. A bankers'
bank is not a depository institution as defined in the Board's Regulation A (12 CFR 201.2(a)).

The Board anticipates that the penalty fee will provide an incentive for institutions without regular discount window
access to refrain from incurring daylight overdrafts. This incentive will help a Reserve Bank to avoid a situation
where it may be obliged to permit an overnight overdraft or to extend extraordinary discount window credit if an institution
is unable to cover a daylight overdraft by the end of the business day. In addition, should daylight overdrafts be considered
as Federal Reserve extensions of credit, the penalty fee for bankers' banks that do not maintain reserves would reflect
the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

policy of reserves for discount window access embodied in the Monetary Control Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Board's current payments system risk policy, most depository institutions may incur daylight overdrafts
in their Federal Reserve accounts up to a maximum, or cap, that is a multiple of their risk-based capital. Effective
April 14, 1994, the Reserve Banks will assess a fee of 24 basis points (annual rate) on average daily daylight overdrafts.
After full phase-in, expected in 1996, this fee will rise to 60 basis points (annual rate). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an institution fails to cover a daylight overdraft by the close of the business day, it may either obtain a discount
window loan (if it has access to the discount window) or carry the overdraft overnight (a practice that is discouraged
by the Federal Reserve). The Reserve Banks charge a penalty fee on overnight overdrafts. Since 1981, the overnight
penalty rate has equalled the higher of 10 percent or the federal funds rate plus 2 percent (annual rate). On February
16, 1994, the Board approved a new overnight overdraft penalty rate equal to the federal funds rate plus 4 percent,
with no floor. When an institution incurs an overnight overdraft, it must make up for any reserve or clearing account
deficiency by holding make-up balances on another night. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Reserve Act exempts bankers' banks from reserve requirements,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and Regulation A explicitly excludes bankers' banks from regular discount window access.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nevertheless, the Board has permitted bankers' banks to have access to the discount window if they choose to maintain
reserves voluntarily. Bankers' banks that maintain reserves may establish a cap and incur daylight overdrafts under
the payments system risk policy to the same extent and subject to the same fees as depository institutions. To address
the risks arising from daylight overdrafts and to avoid the extension of overnight credit to institutions with no
discount window access, current policy provides that bankers' banks that do not maintain reserves should refrain
from incurring daylight overdrafts. If such institutions do incur daylight overdrafts, however, they are required
to post collateral to cover the overdrafts.

Edge corporations are subject to reserve requirements, but do not have access to the discount window on the same basis
as depository institutions. Instead, Edge corporations generally are funded by their parent depository institutions,
which have discount window access. Current policy permits Edge corporations to establish a cap and to incur overdrafts
within that cap, provided that they post collateral to cover the overdrafts. Edge corporations also may incur book-entry
securities overdrafts above their cap, provided the overdrafts are collateralized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limited-purpose trust companies may become members of the Federal Reserve, at the Board's discretion, subject to
conditions the Board may prescribe pursuant to the Act. As a general matter, member limited-purpose trust companies
do not accept reservable deposits, do not have regular discount window access, and may not incur daylight overdrafts.

Previous Board Actions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In May 1990, the Board proposed to levy a penalty fee, at a rate equal to the overnight overdraft penalty rate, on the
maximum daily daylight overdrafts incurred by bankers' banks that do not maintain reserves and Edge corporations
(55 FR 22086, May 31, 1990). In August 1993, the Board adopted a modified version of the 1990 proposal, but sought further
comment on the rate at which the daylight overdraft penalty fee would be assessed (58 FR 44672, August 24, 1993). The
policy adopted by the Board in 1993 provides that the daylight overdraft penalty fee will be levied on the daily average,
rather than maximum, daylight overdraft of institutions that do not have regular discount window access. The Board
also determined to apply the daylight overdraft penalty fee to limited-purpose trust companies as well as bankers'
banks that do not maintain reserves and Edge corporations. The Board retained the requirement that, in the event a
bankers' bank, Edge corporation, or limited-purpose trust company incurs a daylight overdraft, the overdraft should
be collateralized.

Bank error.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As these institutions do not normally maintain collateral pledged to the Federal Reserve on an ongoing basis, if a
bankers' bank, Edge corporation, or limited-purpose trust company incurs a daylight overdraft, the Reserve Bank
generally requests a pledge of collateral (that would be eligible collateral for a discount window loan) for an appropriate
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The daylight penalty rate proposed in 1993 was equal to the overnight penalty rate plus the federal funds rate (e.g.,
given a 10 percent overnight penalty rate and a 3 percent federal funds rate, the daylight penalty rate would be 13 percent),
adjusted for the length of the Fedwire operating day. The Board proposed the addition of the federal funds rate to make
the daylight penalty rate more comparable to the overnight penalty rate. As noted above, institutions are required
to make up any reserve or clearing account deficiency resulting from an overnight overdraft, thereby incurring a
loss of interest earnings on the make-up funds. Rather than instituting a make-up requirement for daylight overdrafts
subject to the penalty fee, the Board proposed that the daylight overdraft penalty rate include a factor to account
for the cost of holding make-up funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also proposed to adjust the manner in which the penalty fee is calculated to make it similar to the calculation
of the ``regular'' daylight overdraft fee. The regular daylight overdraft fee is quoted on a 24-hour basis, for a 360-day
year, and adjusted for the length of the Fedwire operating day. This adjustment maintains a constant per-minute charge
in the event that Fedwire hours change. The Board proposed that the daylight penalty rate be quoted on a similar basis.
Under the 1993 proposal, assuming an overnight overdraft rate of 10 percent and a federal funds rate of 3 percent, the
annual 24-hour daylight penalty rate would be 22.3 percent, adjusted to 9.3 percent for a 10-hour Fedwire operating
day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Daylight Overdraft Penalty Rate Adopted by the Board
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes that it is appropriate to retain a relatively high overnight penalty rate (i.e., greater than the
federal funds rate) to provide a strong incentive for all depository institutions to avoid overnight overdrafts.
However, a daylight penalty rate tied to the overnight rate would also be relatively high, perhaps higher than necessary
to provide an incentive for institutions to avoid daylight overdrafts. Therefore, the daylight overdraft penalty
rate adopted by the Board is tied to the regular daylight overdraft rate, rather then the overnight penalty rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The daylight overdraft penalty rate adopted by the Board is equal to the regular Federal Reserve daylight overdraft
rate plus 100 basis points. The annual daylight penalty rate will equal 124 basis points as of April 14, 1994, rising
to 160 basis points when the regular daylight overdraft fee is fully phased in. The daylight penalty rate, like the
regular daylight rate, will be adjusted to take account of the length of the Fedwire operating day, yielding a rate
of 52 basis points as of April 14, 1994 (given a 10-hour Fedwire day), and rising to 67 basis points after full phase-in
of the regular daylight fee. There is no deductible associated with the daylight overdraft penalty fee. In addition,
the Board has set a minimum fee of $25 for any two-week period in which a penalty fee is assessed (i.e., any fee greater
than zero and less than $25 over a two-week period would be rounded up to $25).

The corporate credit union commenters generally expressed similar views regarding the proposal. They opposed both
the concept of the daylight overdraft penalty and the size of the proposed rate. These commenters contended that the
Board did not present a legally sustainable case as to why the same daylight overdraft rate should not be imposed on
all institutions. They also asserted that the Federal Reserve Act does not authorize a penalty fee for corporate credit
unions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The corporate credit union commenters, as well as the National Credit Union Administration, maintained that one
of the purposes of the proposed penalty fee appeared to be to penalize those bankers' banks that do not maintain reserves.
They argued that it is unwarranted and contrary to the letter and spirit of the Monetary Control Act (MCA) for the Board
to attempt to reduce the equality of treatment among users of Federal Reserve services by assessing corporate credit
unions a penalty fee for daylight overdrafts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters, including a bank trade association, a bank holding company, and a commercial bankers' bank, agreed
that the MCA does not require the Federal Reserve to treat daylight credit as a service to which depository institutions
should have equal access. Two of these commenters stated that charging the same rate for all daylight overdrafts would
give an unfair competitive advantage to those institutions that do not maintain reserves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history of the MCA indicates that Congress intended bankers' banks to have access to Federal Reserve
payment services despite the fact that they do not maintain reserves, but also indicates that the access to Federal
Reserve services was opened up to depository institutions in general because they all were to be subject to reserve
requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board believes that, when implementing a fee for daylight overdrafts incurred through use of Federal Reserve
payments services, it is reasonable to establish different rates for institutions that maintain reserves and those
that do not. The language of the MCA supports this distinction, by explicitly providing that the Board may impose balances
``sufficient for clearing purposes'' as a requirement for access to Federal Reserve services. By including this
provision, Congress recognized that certain institutions with access to Federal Reserve services may not hold reserves
at the Reserve Bank and may be subject to terms that would account for that fact.

The corporate credit union commenters also stated that the Board has not shown how daylight overdrafts incurred by
corporate credit unions differ from those incurred by commercial banks and other depository institutions. Many
of these commenters cited the Board's 1989 overdraft survey, which showed that corporate credit unions incurred
only 0.18 percent of the total amount of daylight overdrafts incurred. The corporate credit unions, as well as an Edge
corporation, stated that a penalty incentive is not necessary, as these institutions rarely incur daylight overdrafts.
The commenters also stated that corporate credit unions do not incur overnight overdrafts, and therefore there is
no evidence that a daylight penalty fee is necessary to prevent overnight overdrafts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes there is a fundamental difference between overdrafts incurred by institutions that have access
to Federal Reserve credit and those that do not. Even though corporate credit union overdrafts constitute only a small
percentage of the total daylight overdrafts in Federal Reserve accounts, the Board believes that these institutions
should not receive any daylight credit from the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, the Board allows depository institutions
with discount window access to incur limited daylight overdrafts. The daylight overdraft penalty fee reflects this
difference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The corporate credit unions and the National Credit Union Administration argued that the proposed penalty fee is
excessive for the purposes of discouraging daylight overdrafts. These commenters also noted that the Board has stated
that even the regular daylight overdraft fee of 60 basis points (adjusted to 25 basis points given a 10-hour Fedwire
day) will provide an incentive for depository institutions to reduce daylight overdrafts. The corporate credit
union commenters, as well as a bank trade association, also noted that the 10 percent floor in the current overnight
penalty rate, to which the proposed daylight penalty rate was tied, yields an anomalous result as the federal funds
rate declines. One commenter suggested that a daylight penalty rate 100 basis points above the federal funds rate
should provide more than sufficient incentive for corporate credit unions to avoid daylight overdrafts. Four commenters,
including a bank holding company and a commercial bankers' bank, supported the Board's proposed penalty fee calculation
as equitable and sufficient to deter daylight overdrafts.

As noted above, the daylight overdraft penalty rate adopted by the Board will not be linked to the overnight penalty
rate, but rather to the regular daylight rate applicable to depository institutions. The daylight penalty rate will
be computed using the regular daylight rate plus a penalty add-on of 100 basis points, which is more proportional to
the regular daylight rate. This policy will allow the Board to maintain a relatively high overnight rate that will
provide a strong incentive to avoid overnight overdrafts, while maintaining a relatively low daylight penalty rate
that will be less of a cost burden on affected institutions yet high enough to effect behavioral changes by institutions
to avoid daylight overdrafts altogether. The Board may consider raising the penalty rate if such behavioral changes
do not occur. Also, if an intraday market rate were to develop in the future, the Board may base the daylight penalty
on that rate. The daylight penalty rate will be adjusted to account for the length of the Fedwire operating day (multiplied
by 10/24, given the current 10-hour Fedwire day), as is the regular daylight overdraft rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A bank trade association recognized the Board's intent to prevent institutions that do not have regular discount
window access from obtaining credit from the Federal Reserve, but stated that a penalty-oriented approach could
result in risk-shifting from the Federal Reserve to the private sector, rather than reducing overall payment system
risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of the penalty fee is to induce institutions to manage their accounts so as to avoid overdrafts, this reducing
overall risk. The Board recognizes, however, that some risk-shifting would occur if institutions affected by the
penalty fee move their payments business from the Federal Reserve to the private sector. Presumably, however, the
risk would be shifted to depository institutions that have discount window access and thus could obtain Federal Reserve
credit to cover daylight or overnight overdrafts in their Federal Reserve accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several corporate credit union commenters stated that the proposed penalty fee formula unfairly penalizes corporate
credit unions by not allowing a deductible. The commenters noted that the Board's stated purpose of the deductible
for depository institutions was to refrain from charging a large number of institutions who present small amount
of risk and that this reasoning should also apply to corporate credit unions. One commenter suggested that, as an alternative
to a deductible, the Board allow a one-hour grace period before assessing a penalty fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board established a deductible for the regular daylight overdraft fee to account for Reserve Bank error and computer
downtime. The deductible also provides a minimal amount of free intraday credit to depository institutions. The
Board does not believe that it is appropriate to supply free intraday credit to institutions that do not have discount
window access, and thus has not provided a deductible or grace period for the daylight penalty fee. Reserve Banks will
be able to waive penalty fees that result from Reserve Bank error or computer malfunction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested that no penalty fee be imposed until the Federal Reserve's book-entry securities system
is redesigned to allow receiver control of securities deliveries. These commenters stated that the current system's
design forces unanticipated daylight overdrafts and that the penalty fee punishes certain institutions for a shortfall
in the Federal Reserve's book-entry securities transfer system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although institutions that receive securities versus payment over Fedwire do not have operational control over
the timing of the transaction, they often know the approximate size and time of incoming securities deliveries. The
Board believes it is appropriate to require institutions without access to Federal Reserve credit to manage their
account so as to avoid securities-related overdrafts. The Federal Reserve is currently studying new service capabilities
that would permit receivers of securities to control the use of securities-related intraday Federal Reserve credit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An Edge corporation requested that, if a penalty fee is imposed, the Board clarify that an Edge corporation could pledge
collateral to support regular discount window borrowing similar to the policy allowing bankers' banks to voluntarily
maintain reserves, thereby allowing such Edge corporations to pay only the regular daylight overdraft fee rather
than the penalty fee. This commenter also suggested that the Board should allow a parent bank to guarantee the daylight
overdraft position of, or substitute itself for, an Edge corporation, similar to practice under CHIPS rules. This
practice would allow a Reserve Bank to combine the daylight position of an Edge corporation and its parent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes that collateral and pricing serve two related but separate purposes. Although collateral limits
Reserve Bank risk, its purpose is to make discount window loans to book-entry securities overdrafters feasible during
periods of operational difficulty. The daylight overdraft penalty fee is designed to create economic incentives
to eliminate the use of daylight credit by institutions without regular discount window access. Their lack of access
to the discount window suggests that Edge corporations should be subject to the same policy as bankers' banks that
do not maintain reserves. The policy statement notes that the parent of an Edge or agreement corporation could fund
its subsidiary during the day over Fedwire and/or the parent could substitute itself for its subsidiary on private
networks. Such an approach by the parent could both reduce systemic risk exposure and permit the Edge or agreement
corporation to continue to service its customers.

Many corporate credit unions have argued that the daylight overdraft penalty fee would put them at a competitive disadvantage
vis-a-vis other payments system participants, particularly in book-entry security settlement and safekeeping
services. These commenters asserted that daylight overdraft penalty fees would drive corporate credit unions out
of the securities services and would force credit unions to do business with other service providers. Such other service
providers could be private institutions, such as commercial banks, or credit unions could choose to establish accounts
directly with a Federal Reserve Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board does not believe that its policy adversely affects the ability of corporate credit unions to compete with
the Reserve Banks in providing payments services. The policy places controls on the use of the Federal Reserve Banks'
funds and book-entry transfer services, which are consistent with controls used in private clearing and settlement
systems. Corporate credit unions have the ability to establish caps and collateralize book-entry securities overdrafts
if they voluntarily maintain reserves, as commercial banks are required to do. By voluntarily maintaining reserves,
the corporate credit unions would avoid the penalty fees that, according to their comments, would cause their customer
credit unions to go to the Reserve Banks or elsewhere for payments services. In addition, the penalty rate adopted
by the Board is significantly lower than the rates proposed in 1990 and 1993 and will result in a lower cost burden on
corporate credit unions vis-a-vis their competitors.

Policy Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has adopted the following to replace part (I)(D)(4) of its ``Federal Reserve System Policy Statement on
Payments System Risk'' under the headings ``I. Federal Reserve Policy'', ``D. Net Debit Caps'', and ``4. Special
Situations,'' effective April 14, 1994: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special Situations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Special risks are presented by the participation on Fedwire of Edge and agreement corporations, bankers' banks that
are not subject to reserve requirements, limited-purpose trust companies, and institutions that have been assigned
a cap of zero by their Reserve Banks. Most of these institutions lack regular discount window access. In developing
its policy for these institutions, the Board has sought to balance the goal of reducing and managing risk in the payments
system, including risk to the Federal Reserve, with that of minimizing the adverse effects on the payments operations
of these institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regular access to the Federal Reserve discount window generally is available to institutions that are subject to
reserve requirements. If an institution that is not subject to reserve requirements and thus does not have regular
discount window access were to incur a daylight overdraft, the Federal Reserve may face the necessity of extending
overnight credit to that institution if the daylight overdraft is not covered by the end of the business day. This credit
would be contrary to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
quid pro quo 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of reserves for discount window access established in the Federal Reserve Act and Board regulations. In addition,
the Board expects that assessing a fee for daylight overdrafts could lead to an intraday funds market, similar to the
current overnight funds market. As daylight credit begins to have significant value, daylight overdrafts in accounts
at the Federal Reserve will begin to appear more and more like overnight extensions of credit by Reserve Banks. Thus,
institutions that do not have regular access to the discount window should not incur either overnight overdrafts
or daylight overdrafts in their Federal Reserve accounts.

As set out below, Edge and agreement corporations, bankers' banks that are not subject to reserve requirements, and
limited-purpose trust companies are subject to a daylight overdraft penalty fee levied against the average daily
daylight overdraft incurred by the institution. The annual rate for the daylight overdraft penalty fee is equal to
the annual rate applicable to the daylight overdrafts of other depository institutions (i.e., the rate set forth
in section (I)(B)) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
plus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 100 basis points, adjusted to take account of the Fedwire operating day (multiplied by the fraction of the day Fedwire
is scheduled to operate). The daily daylight penalty rate is calculated by dividing the annual penalty rate by 360.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The penalty fee applies to the institution's average daily daylight overdraft in accounts at the Federal Reserve.
The average daily overdraft is calculated by dividing the sum of the negative Federal Reserve account balances at
the end of each minute of the scheduled Fedwire operating day (with positive balances set to zero) by the total number
of minutes in the scheduled Fedwire operating day. The penalty fee is charged in lieu of, not in addition to, the daylight
overdraft fee described in section (I)(B) and is effective April 14, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overnight overdrafts for these institutions are treated similarly to overnight overdrafts of other depository
institutions.

The Board notes that the parent of an Edge or agreement corporation could fund its subsidiary during the day over Fedwire
and/or the parent could substitute itself for its subsidiary on private networks. Such an approach by the parent could
both reduce systemic risk exposure and permit the Edge or agreement corporation to continue to service its customers.

For the purposes of this policy statement, a bankers' bank is a financial institution that is not required to maintain
reserves under the Board's Regulation D (12 CFR part 204) because it is organized solely to do business with other financial
institutions, is owned primarily by the financial institutions with which it does business, and does not do business
with the general public and is not a depository institution as defined in the Board's Regulation A (12 CFR 201.2(a)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board's policy for bankers' banks reflects the need to protect Reserve Banks from potential losses resulting
from daylight overdrafts incurred by bankers' banks. The policy also reflects the fact that some bankers' banks do
not incur the costs of maintaining reserves as do other depository institutions and do not have regular access to the
discount window and the similarity between overdrafts and discount window credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bankers' banks may voluntarily waive their exemption from reserve requirements, thus gaining access to the discount
window. Such bankers' banks would be free to establish caps and would be subject to the same policy as other depository
institutions. The policy set out in this section applies only to those bankers' banks that have not waived their exemption
from reserve requirements.

Zero-cap depository institutions.

Some depository institutions have caps of zero that are imposed by Reserve Banks because of the institutions' financially
troubled status or failure to comply with the Board's payments system risk policy or because the institution itself
requested a zero cap. Regardless of whether it has access to the discount window, if a depository institution on which
a Reserve Bank has imposed, or that has adopted, a zero cap incurs a funds-transfer-related overdraft, the Reserve
Bank would counsel the institution and may monitor the institution's activity in real-time and reject or pend any
Fedwire funds transfer instruction that would cause an overdraft. Because the timing of book-entry securities transfers
are not fully within the control of the receiving depository institution, the Board will allow depository institutions
with caps of zero that have access to the discount window to continue to incur book-entry overdrafts, but will require
that such overdrafts be collateralized even if they are infrequent and modest.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board has approved an expansion of Fedwire funds transfer operating hours for the public policy benefits that
will result through the use, over the long term, of the service by banks individually and through clearing groups.
The Board believes that the potential, long run benefits from offering final payment capabilities that will strengthen
interbank settlements outweigh the costs to the Federal Reserve of expanding the Fedwire funds transfer service
operating hours. Over time, longer Fedwire funds transfer hours can contribute to reductions in Herstatt risk through
innovations in payment and settlement practices. As well, the Fedwire funds transfer service will become a tested
tool for managing settlement risk early in the day during times of financial stress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, the Board is announcing that the hours of operation of the Fedwire on-line funds transfer service will
be expanded to 18 hours per day, opening at 12:30 a.m. e.t. and closing at 6:30 p.m. e.t., five days per week (Monday through
Friday) to become effective in early 1997. A specific implementation date will be announced approximately one year
in advance of the effective date. Intraday credit from the Federal Reserve will be available during expanded hours
on the same terms that it would be provided from 8:30 a.m. e.t. to 6:30 p.m. e.t. Further expansion of the funds transfer
operating day could be considered following several years of experience with the new schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Board is announcing that current Fedwire securities transfer operating hours will not be expanded
until after the implementation of new service capabilities that permit receivers of securities to control the use
of securities-related intraday Federal Reserve credit. Public comment will be sought in 1994 on new service capabilities
that permit users the option to participate in expanded securities transfer service operating hours and to control
the receipt of securities that are delivered to them during expanded hours. This request for public comment could
be combined with a request for views on the use of similar service features during regular securities transfer operating
hours. In the case of expanded or regular hours, but especially in the latter case, a key issue concerns the effects
of such changes on the liquidity and efficiency of the U.S. government securities market.

 The growth in financial market activity worldwide, and in foreign exchange market activity in particular, has heightened
attention and sensitivity to settlement and systemic risks. Market participants, as well as regulators, are particularly
concerned about current methods for settling multi-currency, cross-border transactions. Data published by the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS) indicate that the daily average value of global foreign exchange market
activity was approximately $880 billion in April 1992.

The most significant settlement risks presented by foreign exchange or other multi-currency contracts involve
the risk that a counterparty to such contracts will pay one currency and not receive payment in the contra-currency.
Concerns about such risks have been prominent since the failure of Bankhaus Herstatt in 1974, when foreign exchange
counterparties of Herstatt made Deutsche mark payments to Herstatt to settle foreign exchange contracts, but did
not receive contra-payments in U.S. dollars before the closure of the bank, which occurred at the end of the German
banking day. The settlement risk associated with the sequential payment of currencies, and involving the potential
loss of the full principal amount of foreign exchange contracts, has come to be known as Herstatt risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the rapid growth of the foreign exchange markets since 1974, foreign exchange contracts are currently settled
much as they were at the time of the Herstatt episode. For example, in the case of yen-U.S. dollar foreign exchange contracts,
the yen amounts due on a particular banking day would be paid and settled in Tokyo before the start of that banking day
in New York. U.S. dollar contra-payments would likely be initiated early in the U.S. banking day and settled with finality
at the end of the U.S. banking day, some 18 hours after the close of business in Tokyo. Similarly, payments in most European
currencies would be made and settled hours before U.S. dollar payments are either initiated or settled with finality.
The overall magnitude of Herstatt risks associated with these settlement delays has grown commensurately with the
rapid growth in foreign exchange and other multi-currency transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the past few years, there has been a series of central bank studies aimed at heightening the understanding and
awareness of risks in various international payment and settlement processes. These studies have also provided
a common framework for evaluating both new and enhanced interbank settlement arrangements, as well as changes in
central bank services, that might be designed to reduce and manage better Herstatt risk. Working groups from the G&hyph;10
central banks have published reports, under the aegis of the BIS, on such topics as minimum standards for interbank
netting systems, delivery-versus-payment (DVP) in securities settlement systems, and options for enhanced central
bank payment and settlement services with respect to multi-currency and cross-border transactions.

The recent report on central bank services, for example, pointed to the significant expansion of the operating hours
for large-value payment systems as an important central bank option that could contribute to reductions in risk in
settlement practices. Longer hours for central bank large-value payment systems would provide the banking sector
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with additional flexibility in developing innovative methods to reduce time delays between the settlement of the
different legs of foreign exchange contracts. Such innovations might include the development of delivery-versus-payment
techniques, in which one currency is paid (settled) when and only when the contra-currency is also paid (settled),
either by individual correspondent banks or by groups of banks that are members of clearing arrangements. Over the
long run, such arrangements could substantially reduce Herstatt risks in the settlement of multi-currency contracts.

Significant advances in information technology have been introduced to banking and financial markets in recent
years. The level of automation and sophistication of banking systems has increased rapidly and likely will continue
to do so for some time to come. In this environment, and particularly during a time of increasing volumes, values, and
sophistication of financial transactions, advanced technology needs to be applied to payment systems so that these
systems can provide for both high efficiency and low risk in the settlement of all kinds of economic transactions.
The adoption and implementation of this kind of technology, however, requires significant lead times and careful,
advanced planning.

Against this background, and following public comment on the Board's October 1992 proposal to open the Fedwire funds
transfer service two hours earlier in the morning, the Board directed a staff task force (Fedwire Study Group, see
Appendix A of this notice) to discuss the issues involving longer Fedwire hours with representatives of commercial
banks and other interested members of the public and to analyze the associated public policy concerns. These discussions
helped clarify the issues relating to the expansion of Fedwire hours and the difficulties in devising new techniques
to reduce settlement risks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consideration of the appropriate operating hours for the Fedwire funds and securities transfer services must, in
the first instance, take account of the Federal Reserve's responsibilities as a central bank to support final interbank
settlement. The Federal Reserve Banks provide final interbank payment and settlement services to the banking system
through the transfer of banks' balances (reserves and clearing balances) on deposit with Reserve Banks. These balances_also
called central bank money_are free of default risk and are an integral part of monetary arrangements for the U.S. dollar.
``Instantaneous'' intraday final payment in risk-free, central bank money is delivered operationally to banks
through the Fedwire funds and securities transfer services. The benefits of such instantaneous intraday final payment
in central bank money are, in turn, available to the public through the payment services provided by banks to their
customers. To achieve this level of finality, Fedwire and similar sophisticated central bank payment services rely
on a processing technique known as real-time gross settlement. In fact, most G&hyph;10 central banks currently provide,
or are in the process of introducing, real-time gross settlement payment services, along the lines of the Fedwire
funds transfer service.

 The central banks of the European Union have recommended that every central bank in the European Union install a real-time

The following two public policy objectives can be stated for the Fedwire funds and securities transfer services.
These public policy objectives are useful as a guide to analysis of expanded operating hours and were used by the Fedwire
Study Group to set the stage for discussions held with the public. Fedwire should: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provide a means that can be used to enhance the safety and efficiency of U.S. dollar settlement arrangements, including
arrangements that rely on interbank settlement of netted positions, particularly during periods of financial stress.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Respond to the needs of both existing and emerging financial markets, including overseas markets, which depend
on the U.S. dollar and are increasingly reliant on state-of-the-art technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members of the Fedwire Study Group met with representatives of various commercial banks, broker-dealers, and clearing
organizations, and with a group of corporate treasurers to discuss current problems in payment and settlement arrangements.
The Fedwire Study Group encountered a diversity of views within the financial industry, and even within individual
organizations, regarding approaches to managing settlement risk and the use of Fedwire to obtain real-time gross
settlement in central bank money outside of current operating hours.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The diversity of views is, in part, related to the functional responsibilities of the individuals interviewed. For
example, a number of persons with credit management responsibilities in banks and other financial firms tended to
favor expanded Fedwire hours based on the potential benefits associated with access to final, that is, irrevocable
and unconditional, settlement using central bank money_notably, potential reductions in counterparty and systemic
risk. In contrast, individuals with responsibilities for transaction processing services and information technology
within banking organizations tended not to favor an expansion of Fedwire operating hours because, for example, (1)
they could not identify customer demand for longer Fedwire hours, (2) there would be costs and operational challenges
associated with ``off hour'' services, and (3) competitive responses by rival banking organizations would compel
them to undertake product and operational changes. In addition, many of those interviewed also pointed to the charging
of fees for Federal Reserve intraday credit as creating a disincentive to the use of Fedwire funds and securities transfer
services during both regular and expanded hours of operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A main concern raised during the meetings held by the Fedwire Study Group, particularly by executives and senior credit
managers, was that of settlement risk in foreign exchange dealings, or Herstatt risk. Those expressing concern noted,
however, that while expanded Fedwire funds transfer operating hours might be useful as a component part of some new
approaches to controlling Herstatt risk, without changes in overall settlement practices, longer hours would not
be able to make a major contribution to risk reduction. Further, changes in risk management techniques and settlement
practices would need to take account of a variety of operational and financial factors for different currencies.
Some of these issues are discussed further in appendix C of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given that there is a reduced tolerance for temporal risk in settlements, especially_but not solely_settlement
of multi-currency transactions, the Board anticipates that efforts to control settlement risk will continue, with
or without the support of central banks. The Board believes, however, that final, real-time gross settlement through
Fedwire should play an important part in market efforts to control risk more effectively. As discussed earlier, final
settlements in central bank money are free of default risk and, as a result, settlement in central bank money provides
the highest possible degree of certainty and liquidity in interbank settlements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The routine availability of Fedwire on an expanded schedule will add final interbank payment capabilities that the
markets, the Federal Reserve, and other federal regulatory agencies recognize as being particularly important
during periods of financial stress. Only by becoming familiar with the use of expanded Fedwire will banks be prepared
operationally and procedurally to use expanded final payment capabilities effectively. Over time, as the availability
and use of expanded Fedwire capabilities becomes more routine, operating procedures for using Fedwire earlier in
the day will become well tested and integrated into banks' operations and contingency planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, expanding Fedwire operating hours will eliminate an operational barrier that stifles potentially
important innovation in privately-provided payment and settlement services. Expansion of Fedwire operating hours
will provide opportunities for market participants to experiment with the use of real-time gross settlement to meet
a variety of market needs. New bank services and settlement arrangements based on real-time gross settlement will
have the potential to reduce significantly banks' own and their customers' settlement risks in the foreign exchange
and other markets.

A Federal Reserve initiative to expand Fedwire funds transfer operating hours also demonstrates a long-term commitment
to increasing the availability of real-time gross settlement services in the international financial system. The
Federal Reserve is taking a leadership role in the international financial community in seeking to stimulate new
or enhanced central bank services to facilitate cross-border, multi-currency payments and settlements. By expanding
the operating hours of Fedwire, the Federal Reserve will make it possible for banks to settle the U.S. dollar, with
finality using central bank money, during the banking and trading days of major international financial centers
in Europe and the Far East.

 Staff notes that the Bank of Japan recently expanded the operating hours for its large-value funds transfer system
to later in the Tokyo banking day. Also, as noted earlier, the European Union central banks have recently endorsed

hours for settlement services.

Finally, a clearly stated Federal Reserve policy regarding Fedwire operating hours provides the certainty and stability
banks have indicated that they need to develop their own business and technology plans. This approach to communicating
Federal Reserve policy was requested both in public comments on the Board's October 1992 proposal and in meetings
with representatives of the industry held by the Fedwire Study Group. As noted here, expanded Fedwire funds transfer
operating hours are announced three years in advance of implementation. Banks will have a clear understanding of
the Federal Reserve's intentions with respect to its operating hours and could use the lead time to incorporate the
expanded hours into their strategic plans for payment services and supporting technical systems.

Fedwire on-line funds transfer operating hours will be expanded to open at 12:30 a.m. e.t. (5:30 a.m. G.m.t. and 2:30
p.m. Tokyo time) to support strengthened, interbank settlement for domestic and cross-border markets. This precedes
the opening of the current European banking day by about three hours and overlaps with current payment system and money
market hours in Tokyo by about two and one-half hours. This overlap of payment system hours could increase further
if, in the future, the operating hours of other national payment systems were expanded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The closing time for the Fedwire funds transfer service will remain at 6:30 p.m. e.t. (11:30 p.m. G.m.t. and 8:30 a.m.
Tokyo time), in order not to delay inordinately the calculation of U.S. dollar positions by U.S. banks providing dollar
clearing services to clients operating in the Asian markets, or to disrupt domestic money management. Further, keeping
the closing time at 6:30 p.m. e.t. will not disturb the reserve management operations of the large number of smaller
U.S. banks that are not active internationally and that are unlikely to participate in an expanded Fedwire operating
day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Reserve's estimated incremental costs to operate the funds transfer service from 12:30 a.m. e.t. to 6:30
p.m. e.t. will be roughly $2.5 to $4.0 million per year, or about 3 to 5 percent of the total cost of providing the service
in 1993. While the operational costs incurred by banks using Fedwire during the expanded operating period are difficult
to estimate, such costs would be incurred entirely voluntarily. Banks could choose to remain closed during the expanded
operating period and thus forego any additional operating costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, an 18-hour day (beginning at 12:30 a.m. e.t. and closing at 6:30 p.m. e.t.) provides an adequate six-hour
quiet period within which banks can perform end-of-day processing and provides for contingency situations. It also
provides for a definite period for measuring reserve positions, a requirement for the conduct of monetary policy.
There are some other minor issues posed by an 18-hour Fedwire funds transfer day that are discussed in appendix C of
this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to Fedwire securities transfer operating hours, under current DVP arrangements, banks do not have the
capability to control the timing of deliveries of securities and associated debits to their funds accounts. Accordingly,
banks have limited control over the effect of securities-related debits on their funds positions and their use of
Federal Reserve securities-related intraday credit. These control limitations could lead to either increased
operating costs or increased use of intraday credit, with accompanying charges, during periods of expanded hours.
(See appendix C of this notice for further discussion.) In contrast to the Fedwire funds transfer service, therefore,
expanding the operating hours of the securities transfer service would likely impose unavoidable costs on a large
number of banks. Thus, the Board believes that it is inadvisable at this time to approve an expansion of the operating
hours for the Fedwire securities transfer service.

During expanded Fedwire funds transfer operating hours, the Federal Reserve Banks will be providing real-time gross
settlement in central bank money. While this service cannot be duplicated in the private sector, this situation is
no different under expanded operating hours than it is under the existing Fedwire operating hours. Service providers
that provide funds transfer services under a netting arrangement could expand their operating hours to coincide
with Fedwire operating hours; however, only by setting earlier settlement time(s) and settling through Fedwire
could these organizations provide risk-free central bank money earlier in the day to their participants. Service
providers that provide real-time gross settlement funds transfer services across their own books could not solely
backstop these transactions with central bank money and, thus, could be reliant on their own capital and credit standing
to assure participants of final settlement. Again, this situation is no different under expanded operating hours
than it is under normal Fedwire operating hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Most large-value, domestic interbank payments are currently made via the transfer of money balances on the books
of the Federal Reserve Banks through the Fedwire system. Fedwire is the large-value payment system operated by the
Federal Reserve Banks for the transfer of funds and delivery of book-entry (electronic) securities against payment.
Fedwire is a real-time gross settlement system that settles transfers immediately on a transaction-by-transaction
basis. The Fedwire funds transfer service is a credit transfer process. That is, a bank sends a funds transfer to the
Federal Reserve instructing the Federal Reserve to debit its account for a specified amount and to credit the account
of another bank. In 1993, the daily average value of transfers originated over the Fedwire funds transfer system was
about $824 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, the Fedwire securities transfer service, which is the principal means for transferring and settling
U.S. government securities,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 is a debit transfer process that permits the seller of the securities to send a transfer that will result in the Federal
Reserve withdrawing funds from the account of the receiver of the securities transfer. The Fedwire securities transfer
process is based on the delivery-versus-payment (DVP) principle, whereby the final transfer of securities from
the seller to the buyer (delivery) occurs at the same time as final transfer of funds from the buyer to the seller (payment).
Fedwire achieves such simultaneous settlement by treating the instruction initiated by the seller as both an instruction
to deliver securities to the buyer and an instruction to debit payment from the buyer's reserve or clearing account.
In 1993, the daily average value of transfers originated through the Fedwire securities transfer system was roughly
$580 billion.

Netting is performed outside Fedwire through the Government Securities Clearing Corporation (GSCC) for transactions
that settle on a next day or forward basis, with the netted securities and funds positions settled on Fedwire.

Banks may also provide settlement services to their customers through the final transfer of balances across their
books. In addition, banks also use multilateral clearing and settlement arrangements to meet some of their large-value
payment needs. In such arrangements, including the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) operated by
the New York Clearing House, payment instructions may be entered into a netting system throughout a pre-determined
clearing cycle and each participant's net position vis-a-vis the other participants is determined on an ongoing
basis throughout the cycle. Settlement for the payment instructions occurs at an agreed upon settlement time. Participants
with net debit obligations may satisfy their obligations by transferring funds on the books of a ``settlement bank.''
Central banks can serve as a ``settlement bank'' for such interbank netting arrangements and, in the case of CHIPS,
this role is performed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In this arrangement, CHIPS settling participants in
a net debit position send Fedwire funds transfers to a settlement account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which,
when fully funded, is the source for payments to participants in net credit positions. In 1993, the daily average value
of transfers originated through the CHIPS system was over $1 trillion.

Appendix C_Issued Associated With Expanded Fedwire Operating Hours
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This appendix analyzes issues associated with expanded Fedwire funds and securities transfer operating hours.
The appendix is organized in three parts. First, settlement practices in financial markets are analyzed, with particular
attention to Herstatt risk. Second, the operation of the Fedwire securities transfer delivery-versus-payment
service is analyzed. Finally, other implementation issues associated with expanded Fedwire hours are analyzed.

Settlement Practices in Financial Markets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following discussion of settlement practices and risks in financial markets takes into account (1) the integrity
of settlement during times of financial stress, (2) multi-currency, cross-border settlements, (3) domestic corporate
and interbank markets and the needs of the futures markets, and (4) the current availability of bank payment services
on a 24-hour basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Settlement during times of financial stress. Concerns regarding the ability of counterparties to meet their payment
obligations and the certainty of settlement are heightened during times of financial stress. Sudden events that
disrupt markets can increase the risk associated with domestic and, in particular, multi-currency transactions,
and can contribute to uncertainty, payment delays, and market liquidity problems. If such problems are widespread,
systemic risk may be increased substantially. It is during times of stress in the financial markets that the certainty
associated with interbank settlement across the books of the central bank takes on added importance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, the Fedwire funds transfer service has been opened early on an ad hoc basis, at short notice, during times
of stress in the financial markets at the request of market participants and regulatory authorities. For example,
the Federal Reserve opened the Fedwire funds transfer service early on the days following the October 1987 stock market
break and the beginning of the Gulf War. Experience has shown, however, that market participants are not prepared
operationally to use facilities, such as Fedwire, when these facilities are made available during ``off-hours''
on an ad hoc basis at short notice. These difficulties suggest that to be most helpful during times of financial stress,
Fedwire should be available in the early morning hours on a more routine basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Multi-currency settlements. With respect to multi-currency settlements, the settlement of a foreign exchange
contract involves the settlement of both currencies involved in the contract, such as the U.S. dollar and the Deutsche
mark or the U.S. dollar and the yen. In such settlements, risk management and efficiency considerations must take
into account payment arrangements in the country of issue for each currency, including the relative intraday timing
of payments and the finality of payment in the respective currencies. Settlement risk is incurred by paying final
funds in one currency before receiving final funds in another currency. As a general matter, the magnitude of settlement
risk in the foreign exchange markets has grown substantially, in large part as a result of a vast expansion of foreign
exchange trading. At the same time, there has been continued reliance on traditional methods of settling trades one
currency at a time with significant delays before related payments and contra-payments become final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the large U.S. cities are in the western-most time zones of the major financial centers, under current settlement
arrangements for multi-currency transactions, the U.S. dollar is normally the last currency to be settled. The two
charts at the end of this appendix provide information on global time zone relationships and on the operating hours
of selected large-value interbank transfer systems in different countries.

On an exception basis today, banks may choose to require final payment of the U.S. dollar leg of a multi-currency transaction
either in advance of, or in certain cases simultaneously with, final payment of the contra-currency, as a means to
protect against risk of nonpayment.

 Foreign exchange market participants have indicated that such protective measures are taken, for example, in special
cases where counterparties would exceed their U.S. dollar credit lines. Banks, however, find these exception procedures
to be very expensive due to the lack of an established mechanism to effect settlements under these terms (that is, final
U.S. dollar payment before, or simultaneously with, final payment in the other currency). For exception processing,
the parties must negotiate how the related payments are to be made and closely monitor the settlement process to ensure
that the payment sequence unfolds as expected.

Substantially earlier Fedwire funds transfer service operating hours as well as later payment system hours for other
major currencies will increase the opportunity to achieve simultaneous or near-simultaneous settlements of individual
deals involving the U.S. dollar and European and Asian currencies, where needed. Such settlements might involve
a variety of new institutional designs for settlements, including private correspondent bank DVP services, new
clearing organization procedures, or innovative arrangements that are not readily apparent given current payment
system constraints.

Current initiatives to reduce Herstatt risk in foreign exchange transactions point to the need for greater future
overlap of final interbank settlement facilities in Asia, Europe, and North America. While in the future Asian and
European systems may well be open later during their local banking days, the achievement of a significant overlap
in payment system hours also requires earlier opening hours for U.S. payment systems, especially to achieve overlapping
hours with Asian markets. With such earlier hours, opportunities may increase substantially for more nearly simultaneous
settlements of multi-currency transactions, and associated reductions in Herstatt risk. It should be noted, however,
that although simultaneous or near-simultaneous payment for multi-currency transactions reduces the temporal
dimension of settlement risk, achieving final payment in one currency against a simultaneous, but provisional,
payment in another currency does not eliminate fully Herstatt risk. Therefore, to address fully the problem of controlling
Herstatt risk, it is important that the overlap in operating hours include overlap in systems that provide final settlement
in central bank money.

Fedwire in the United States and BOJ-NET in Japan, for example, currently provide real-time gross settlement services
in the U.S. dollar and yen, respectively. Significant projects to establish real-time gross settlement systems
are now underway in France, the United Kingdom, and other countries, and legal developments are occurring that will
help ensure the availability of payment systems in all or most European countries that provide for final payments
on an intraday basis. Thus, in the next few years, concerns about the lack of intraday final payment capabilities in
major industrialized countries are likely to be reduced substantially.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Domestic markets. With respect to domestic markets, there are relatively few types of transactions for which immediate
and final payment at a particular time during the day is an absolute requirement. The demand for final payment at a particular
time during the day for corporate customers is currently quite small and is limited to such things as payments to settle
mergers and acquisitions and the distribution of funds from underwritings of securities. In general, because banks
often make funds available to corporate customers before final settlement, corporate customers are largely unaware
of the distinctions between final and provisional payment or when during the day payments are actually settled. Instead,
corporations generally rely on their banks to make decisions regarding how their large-value payments are originated
and received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even in the interbank markets, participants are typically satisfied with same-day settlement for certain types
of transactions. At present, Federal funds contracts do not generally stipulate that payment must be made at or before
a specific time of day other than before the close of the Fedwire funds transfer service. Federal funds contracts are
generally settled using the Fedwire funds transfer system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For some futures exchange settlements, the convention today is to accept irrevocable commitments to pay from designated
settlement banks to cover clearing members' settlement obligations prior to the start of the current day's trading,
with the settlement banks actually fulfilling the obligation via Fedwire funds transfers by 10 a.m. e.t. The futures
clearing organizations and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have expressed a desire for settlement
to occur in final funds before the commencement of trading. Such earlier settlement is viewed as reducing risks to
futures exchanges and the financial markets despite some concerns that it would merely shift risks from the clearing
organizations to their settlement banks. Settlement banks would clearly need to manage carefully their own cash
needs earlier in the day in order to make settlement payments at an earlier time, which is not necessary under current
arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within a few years, there may be a demand for later Fedwire funds transfer hours from banks that provide services to
the futures and options markets. This demand could arise from two sources. First, some clearing organizations are
progressively moving toward same-day settlement of margin obligations arising from the current day's trading activity.
Second, some of the exchanges are contemplating longer trading hours for certain of their products. The exchanges
are beginning to incorporate automated trade matching and confirmation systems that will permit timely same-day
calculation of all margin obligations. Indications are that these systems, which will remove a significant obstacle
to same-day settlement, could be widely adopted within three to five years. Longer trading hours, in combination
with the desire for same-day settlement, would argue for a later Fedwire funds transfer service closing time.

To date, there has been little evidence of demand for a materially later closing time for the Fedwire funds and securities
transfer services to meet domestic needs. The most likely source of demand to make later payments is from the Pacific
time zone. Banks with operations in that time zone, however, have expressed only slight interest in later Fedwire
hours in response to requests for comment made by the Board of Governors in 1989 and in 1992. Moreover, many corporate
treasurers generally view later-in-the-day payments activity as disruptive to their primary goal of determining
the amount of money available for investment. This preference is, of course, conditioned by current conventions
in the U.S. money markets, especially the times at which decisions must be made to invest or borrow funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank payment services. Currently, a number of large, internationally active U.S. banks offer their customers real-time
account balance inquiry and payment services on a 24-hour basis. Many of these banks offer the capability to originate
payment instructions in up to 60 currencies. Payment orders may be processed as book transfers or held in an electronic
queue until the national payment system for the currency to be paid is open for business. Given current queuing practices,
there would appear to be some scope for earlier settlement of queued payments if international clearing banks find
it advantageous to process customer payments earlier in the day and national payment systems are open to process and
settle such payments.

Fedwire Securities Transfer Service
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned earlier, most interbank transfers of U.S. government securities are processed through Fedwire. The
DVP capability of the Fedwire securities transfer service increases the efficiency and integrity of the securities
clearance and settlement process. In fact, the liquidity of the government securities market is partly a function
of the Fedwire securities transfer system design, whereby the seller is assured of payment at the time the securities
are delivered. While it virtually eliminates settlement risk, the current design of the Fedwire securities transfer
service may, in some cases, result in significant demands for intraday credit. Once Fedwire opens in the morning,
users of the Fedwire securities transfer service have no control over the time at which they may receive securities
on a DVP basis. In particular, since the sellers of securities initiate the DVP transfers, receivers do not have any
operational control over the time during the day when their securities and funds accounts are credited and debited,
respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the inception of the Board's Payment System Risk Reduction Program, the implications of the cost of intraday
credit have taken on greater significance for participants in the Fedwire DVP securities transfer service. Receivers
of securities, especially those maintaining relatively low intraday cash balances, are not in a position to manage
their use of intraday Federal Reserve credit resulting from securities deliveries. Because of the inability to review
transfers prior to receipt, this problem may be compounded if the securities delivery is not known, or the delivery
amounts are incorrect. Although receivers of securities can reverse transfers received in error virtually immediately
after delivery and payment occur, they must very actively monitor and manage their activity to be in a position to do
so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The charging of fees for Federal Reserve intraday overdrafts has important implications for expanding the Fedwire
securities transfer operating hours. An expansion of such operating hours could impose significant cost burdens
on a potentially large number of banks that would need to make a choice between staffing their operations to manage
their intraday overdraft positions, or remaining closed and incurring the costs of intraday overdrafts that might
arise from securities deliveries during ``off-hours.'' In an effort to provide participants with the tools necessary
to manage their operations and credit costs, the Federal Reserve is designing new Fedwire securities transfer service
features, including receiver controls (such as receiver-authorized deliveries) and a mechanism allowing participants
to choose whether to use the service during non-standard business hours. The Board believes that public comment on
these new service features is required because of the impact they would have on senders and receivers of securities
transfers and on the operation of the U.S. government securities market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis of a potential expansion of Fedwire securities transfer service operating hours must also take into account
``free'' transfers of securities, that is, the movement of collateral. The ability to move collateral during early
morning Fedwire operating hours was identified as a potentially useful measure by several clearing organizations
and banks in their comments on the Board's October 1992 Fedwire operating hours proposal. The ability to pledge collateral
during early morning hours can reduce settlement uncertainties and enhance participant liquidity, particularly
in times of financial stress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion above suggests that careful attention must be given in the near term to features of the Fedwire securities
transfer service that limit the control users of the service have over the receipt of securities, particularly if
the hours of operation for the service were to be lengthened. The Board anticipates that the implementation of new
service capabilities, such as those discussed earlier, could reduce or even eliminate the involuntary costs imposed
on receivers of securities transfers, especially during expanded operating hours. Under these conditions, the
public benefits of expanding these operating hours could be significant and would be derived in part from the opportunities
to use securities as collateral, or as a near-cash equivalent, for purposes of meeting obligations that arise overnight.
At present, however, an expansion of hours would not be advisable. The Board believes that the issues surrounding
the development and use of new features for the Fedwire securities transfer service can be effectively addressed
through the public comment process during 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the aforementioned complications associated with operating characteristics of the current Fedwire
securities transfer system, the following analysis of implementation issues is limited to an expansion of Fedwire
funds transfer service operating hours. The key implementation issues addressed in this section are technology,
operational costs, monetary control and reserve management, overlapping business and calendar days, and the Federal
Reserve's intraday overdraft policy.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Technology issues. Banks as well as other financial and non-financial institutions are installing or planning to
install advanced technology to support their critical business functions. For example, many major banking organizations
employ real-time control procedures to manage their own and customer payments over major large-value electronic
payment systems. Many financial organizations are also continuing to automate major dealing functions and integrate
these with their clearing and payment systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In turn, in order to provide the banking and financial system with advanced tools with which to design payment and settlement
arrangements using central bank money, the Federal Reserve is installing advanced computing and communications
systems. These systems will support all of the Federal Reserve's national payment services and accounting functions.
Among other things, this new technology will enable the Federal Reserve to provide real-time gross settlement services
in central bank money virtually around-the-clock. Other benefits of this technology are expected to include greater
payments processing efficiency, improvements in the reliability and availability of critical payment systems,
and enhanced contingency processing capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most existing accounting and other back office systems require that banks, including Federal Reserve Banks, accumulate
a wide range of transactions throughout the day in order to calculate and balance customer account positions. Traditionally,
this ``end-of-day'' processing has been treated as a batch operation for which large quantities of information are
accumulated from a variety of sources and then processed overnight. For example, information received from large
commercial banks that provide corporate payment services and U.S. dollar clearing services reveals that their current
systems have been designed to perform end-of-day processing within an approximate six- to eight-hour window. Most
large commercial banks are either currently changing, or have plans to change, their systems to move to a two- to four-hour
end-of-day processing window, an evolution which should be completed within about five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contingency processing requirements also need to be considered in connection with proposals to expand Fedwire funds
transfer operating hours, or bank payment system operations more generally. Specifically, for large commercial
banks, an 18-hour operating day compresses the current end-of-day processing period, including a ``cushion'' of
time to deal with the failure of regular systems or other unexpected operational disruptions that must be resolved
before opening for the next day's business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that current efforts by banks and other financial institutions to use technology to improve the
efficiency of end-of-day processing will, over the next several years, reduce the time necessary to perform these
activities. Thus, with a 3-year lead time, an 18-hour Fedwire day should provide an adequate cushion of time for end-of-day
processing under normal and most contingency conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operational costs. The Reserve Bank's incremental costs to expand operating hours can be estimated fairly accurately.
The estimated incremental costs to the Federal Reserve of lengthening the current 10-hour funds transfer operating
day to 18 hours are relatively small compared to the total cost of providing the service. Specifically, the Board estimates
that an 18-hour day beginning at 12:30 a.m. e.t. will add roughly $2.5 to $4.0 million to annual Fedwire funds transfer
operating costs, or about 3 to 5 percent of 1993 total service costs.

The incremental costs that would be incurred by banks in using the Fedwire funds transfer service during expanded
hours are difficult to estimate. In any event, the incremental operational costs to banks of participating in expanded
hours would be incurred entirely voluntarily. Banks would make individual business decisions whether to use the
Fedwire funds transfer service during expanded hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monetary control and reserve management issues. The Board believes that an expansion of Fedwire funds transfer operating
hours, involving a 6:30 p.m. e.t. closing time, does not complicate reserve maintenance for banks. Also, provided
that there is a sufficient break in time during the operating day for purposes of measuring reserve holdings, monetary
measurement and control problems do not arise for the Federal Reserve. In the event of full 24-hour operations, both
monetary measurement and control issues would need careful attention.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Overlapping business and calendar days. One complication associated with a Fedwire funds transfer day that begins
earlier than 3 a.m. e.t. concerns asynchronous business and calendar days for domestic payments and possibly for
cross-border payments as well. For example, assuming a 6:30 p.m. e.t. closing time and an 18-hour Fedwire funds transfer
day, the 12:30 a.m. e.t. opening time is 9:30 p.m. Pacific Time (p.t.). This means that today's business day, as defined
by the opening of Fedwire, begins on the prior calendar day in continental United States time zones other than the Eastern
time zone. Some clarification or adjustment in accounting practices and possibly legal conventions may be necessary
to address this situation. These adjustments do not appear to present large issues and they can be readily addressed
through such things as modifications in financial reporting conventions and business practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, financial reporting conventions that rely on precise ``as of'' reporting dates and times would appear
reasonably to address most reporting issues. Similarly, more precision may be needed in financial contracts about
when completion of a payment or other financial transaction must occur. This is a problem that exists today and that
is addressed in contracts by specifying the location at which payment is to be made and the date (``pay to my account
in San Francisco on x date''). The new problem posed by an earlier Fedwire opening time could be addressed readily by
specifying when during the day payment is to be made at a particular location (``pay to my account in San Francisco by
close of Fedwire on x date''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Reserve daylight overdraft policy. In an expanded Fedwire funds transfer operating environment, Federal
Reserve intraday credit will be provided to banks on the same basis that it would be provided from 8:30 a.m. e.t. to 6:30
p.m. e.t. That is, eligible institutions will be able to incur intraday overdrafts subject to the net debit caps and
daylight overdraft fees in place at the time the overdraft is incurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some adjustments to the intraday overdraft measurement rules will be required. For example, posting times for non-wire
transactions settled on the books of the Reserve Banks that are currently tied to the opening of Fedwire, such as ACH
and principal and interest payments for securities, need to be adjusted. Since users will be accustomed to the current
schedule, which generally results in posting these transactions at 8:30 a.m. e.t., a clear option would be for the
Board to consider establishing 8:30 a.m. e.t. as the ``explicit'' posting time for these transactions.

The company listed in this notice has filed an application under  225.23(a)(1) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(1))
for the Board's approval under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and  225.21(a)
of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.21(a)) to commence or to engage

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, either directly or through a subsidiary, in a nonbanking activity that is listed in  225.25 of Regulation Y as closely
related to banking and permissible for bank holding companies. Unless otherwise noted, such activities will be conducted
throughout the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application is available for immediate inspection at the Federal Reserve Bank indicated. Once the application
has been accepted for processing, it will also be available for inspection at the offices of the Board of Governors.
Interested persons may express their views in writing on the question whether consummation of the proposal can ``reasonably
be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency,
that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments regarding the application must be received at the Reserve Bank indicated or the offices of the Board of Governors
not later than March 15, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Part I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Goals of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) is located within the Administration for Children and Families
(ACF), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Although different from the other ACF program administrations
in the specific constituency it serves, ADD shares a common set of goals that promote the economic and social well-being
of families, children, individuals and communities. Through national leadership we see:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Families and individuals empowered to increase their own economic independence and productivity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Strong, healthy, supportive communities having a positive impact on the quality of life and the development
of children;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Partnerships with individuals, front-line service providers, communities, states and Congress that enable
solutions which transcend traditional agency boundaries;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Services planned and integrated to improve client access;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A strong commitment to working with Native Americans, persons with developmental disabilities, refugees
and migrants to address their needs, strengths and abilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emphasis on these goals and progress towards them will help more people with developmental disabilities to live productive
and independent lives integrated into their communities. The Projects of National Significance program is one means
through which ADD promotes the achievement of these goals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two issues are of particular concern with these projects. First, there is a pressing need for networking and cooperation
among specialized and categorical programs, particularly at the service delivery level, to ensure continuation
of coordinated services to people with developmental disabilities. Second, project findings and successful innovative
models of projects need to be made available nationally to policy makers as well as to direct service providers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Purpose of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) is the lead agency within ACF and DHHS responsible for planning
and administering programs which promote the self-sufficiency and protect the rights of people with developmental
disabilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 6000 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (the Act) supports and provides assistance to States and public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations
to assure that all people with developmental disabilities receive the services, assistance and opportunities necessary
to enable them to achieve their maximum potential through increased independence, productivity and integration
into the community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act stresses that individuals with developmental disabilities typically:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Experience significant functional limitations due to physical or mental, or a combination of physical and
mental, impairments; and is manifested before the person attains age 22 (as described in the Act, section 102(5)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Possess significant abilities of which employers are generally unaware;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have wants and needs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Remain unserved or underserved;

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act further finds that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The family and community can play a central role in enhancing their lives when properly supported; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It is in the nation's interest for people with developmental disabilities to be employed, and to live conventional
and independent lives as a part of families and communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Towards these ends, ADD seeks to enhance the capabilities of families in assisting people with developmental disabilities
to achieve their maximum potential to support the increasing ability of people with developmental disabilities
to exercise greater choice and self-determination; to engage in leadership activities in their communities; as
well as to ensure the protection of their legal and human rights.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Part E of the Act, grants and contracts are awarded for Projects of National Significance to increase and support
the independence, productivity and integration into the community of people with developmental disabilities,
and to support the development of national and state policy which enhances the independence, productivity and integration
of these individuals. These projects may include, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;Other projects of sufficient size and scope, and which hold promise of expanding or otherwise improving opportunities
for people with developmental disabilities (especially those who have multiple disabilities or are disadvantaged,
including cultural and ethnic minority groups, (African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Latino
Americans, American Indian and Native Americans, Native Alaskan and Hawaiian) and other underserved groups. In
addition, funds may be awarded for technical assistance and demonstration projects (including research, training,
and evaluation in connection with such projects) which expand or improve the advocacy functions performed by University
Affiliated Programs, State Developmental Disabilities Planning Councils, and the Protection and Advocacy System.

Topics of particular interest to ADD for Fiscal Year 1994 include self-advocacy and empowerment of consumers and/or
their families, specifically members of diverse cultural/ethnic minority constituencies. ADD is seeking disability
and other grassroots organizations, minority coalitions, civil rights and other private non-profit organizations
experienced in working with culturally diverse communities to develop successful collaborative models for supporting
the ability of minorities with developmental disabilities to exercise greater choice and self-determination by
engaging in leadership activities in their communities. Such leadership activities at a minimum should provide
them the needed knowledge, skills and confidence to access services and other supports available to them.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ADD is interested in all comments and recommendations which address areas of existing or evolving national significance
related to the field of developmental disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also solicit recommendations for project activities which will advocate for public policy change and community
acceptance of all people with developmental disabilities and families so that such persons receive the services,
supports, and other assistance and opportunities necessary to enable them to achieve their maximum potential through
increased independence, productivity, and integration into the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADD is also interested in activities which promote the inclusion of all people with developmental disabilities including
persons with the most severe disabilities, in community life; which promote the interdependency of all people with
developmental disabilities with all others; and which recognize the contributions of these individuals, as such
individuals share their talents at home, school, and work, and in recreation and leisure time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No proposals, concept papers or other forms of applications should be submitted at this time. Any such submission
will be discarded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADD will not respond to individual comment letters. However, all comments will be considered in preparing the final
funding solicitation announcement and will be acknowledged and addressed in that announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments should be addressed to: Bob Williams, Commissioner, Administration on Developmental Disabilities, Administration

Proposed Fiscal Year 1994 Priority Area 1: Leadership Education and Development of Individuals With Disabilities
and Their Families From Culturally Diverse Backgrounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent years, individuals with developmental and other disabilities have benefitted from new approaches to providing
services that dramatically changed the lives of many of those who were previously unserved or underserved. However,
many individuals and families, particularly those of culturally diverse backgrounds, remain on the outside looking
in. Many such individuals may seem to have been invisible in the developmental disabilities community. Due to a long
history of cultural stereotyping of such individuals, open discussions about disabilities remain a very sensitive
and emotionally charged topic in some communities. Although minority individuals and families are affected by developmental
and other disabilities (as the population at large), many often cannot gain access to the service system let alone
fully participate in or benefit from it. In many instances, these individuals and families may be poor, may live in
isolated areas; may be homeless or lack general knowledge about the services available to them or how the system works.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, ADD is proposing to fund Projects of National Significance (PNS) that target individuals with developmental
disabilities and their families from culturally diverse backgrounds in an effort to enable them to impact service
delivery and fully access the services they need. These projects would strengthen the ability of individuals with
developmental disabilities and their families from culturally diverse backgrounds to serve as leaders and advocates
on critical issues in the developmental disabilities field, particularly in their own communities. These projects
would assist individuals with developmental disabilities from culturally diverse backgrounds and their families
in the development and implementation of effective methods of communication and systems change to increase public
awareness, inform individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds with disabilities of issues and services, and
to develop and to implement networking strategies that improve access to community resources. Furthermore, these
projects would institutionalize action strategies that promote policies and practices which are family-centered
and community-based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADD is particularly interested in grassroots organizations with a record of planning and implementing programs
with individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds, such as major civil rights organizations, minority coalitions,
and other private non-profits that would be able to establish ongoing working relationships with State Developmental
Disabilities Planning Councils, University Affiliated Programs, Protection and Advocacy Systems and other relevant
community resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is essential to identify local linkages to establish collaborative agreements/arrangements on critical issues
in the developmental disabilities field that would strengthen the capacity of individuals to serve as leaders/ advocates
on behalf of themselves and their families.

Proposed Fiscal Year 1994 Priority Area 2: Expanding the Scope of Developmental Disabilities Planning Councils

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Individuals with significant disabilities other than developmental disabilities can and have benefitted from
the systems change, capacity building and advocacy activities of the Developmental Disabilities Planning Councils
(DDPCs) authorized by Part B of the Act. In response to concerns of some advocates in the States, ADD proposes to award
funds to study the expansion of the scope of DDPCs to include concerns of a broad range of citizens with disabilities
other than developmental disabilities. Because this issue is complex and little information is available regarding
the implications of such an expansion, ADD is interested in funding three types of projects to explore the effects
of such an expansion: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A short-term (not to exceed six months) study of DDPCs that are currently authorized under State law to focus
on individuals with disabilities other than developmental disabilities as well as persons with developmental disabilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Pilot studies in up to five (5) additional states by DDPCs, in conjunction with and with support from Protection
and Advocacy systems and University Affiliated Programs, to explore the implications of expanding the current scope
of Council activity. Pilots are expected to be completed within 15 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A national study of the process, outcomes, and implications of the five (5) pilot studies. Completion of this
study is expected five months following the pilots. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under separate contractual solicitations, ADD proposes to award funds to provide technical assistance to improve
the functions of the DD Council, Protection and Advocacy System, and the University Affiliated Program; and to develop
information and referral systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADD also proposes to fund projects through demonstrations as well as procurements that would ensure the integration
and active participation of racial and ethnic minorities into the ``mainstream'' of the service delivery system.

Purpose:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 CVS is an obstetrical diagnostic procedure done prenatally to detect genetic abnormalities. The safety of the procedure
has been questioned since infants have been reported with birth defects (limb deficiency) after their mothers had
undergone CVS. Studies have been published which both support and contradict the hypothesis that CVS has caused birth
defects. CDC has recently completed a multistate study investigating the association between limb deficiency and
CVS. CDC will convene this public meeting to discuss all recent studies of this issue and to receive advice from individual
participants on establishing public health recommendations for CVS utilization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Matters to Be Discussed:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An invited group of qualified individuals will be asked to provide comments on recent studies of limb deficiency after
CVS. The risk for these birth defects will be discussed in the context of other risks, benefits, and alternatives of
the procedure. A written commentary from CDC which provides recommendations for CVS utilization will also be discussed.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 4M4407) has been filed by Analytical Systems Engineering Corp., 5400 Shawnee Rd., suite 100,
Alexandria, VA 22312. The petition proposes that the food additive regulations in &sect;179.21 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Sources of radiation used for inspection of food, for inspection of packaged food, and for controlling food processing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 179.21) be amended to provide for the safe use of a machine source of high energy X-rays to inspect cargo containers
which may contain food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before March
28, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments. Two copies of any comments are
to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and
4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will also place on public display any amendments to, or comments on, the petitioner's
environmental assessment without further announcement in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Notice is hereby given of the future meeting dates of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Human Embryo Research
Panel, a panel of special consultants to the Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD), NIH, established to recommend
guidelines for Federal funding of human embryo research. Panel meetings will be held March 14, April 11, May 4, and,
tentatively, June 21. The March meeting will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Bethesda Marriott Hotel, 5151 Pooks
Hill Road, Bethesda, Maryland. Logistical information about subsequent Panel meetings will be available from the
contact office listed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until June 1993, Federal regulations governing research on human subjects (45 CFR part 46) required research involving

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vitro
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 fertilization (IVF) to be reviewed by an Ethics Advisory Board (EAB). Because of the absence of an EAB since 1980, Federal
funding of IVF protocols was not possible. With the enactment of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;43),
the regulatory provision requiring EAB review of IVF proposals was nullified. As a result, IVF proposals, as well
as research involving human embryos that result from IVF or other sources, may now be considered for Federal funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIH has received a number of applications for support in this area and in the related field of parthenogenesis.
However, before proceeding with the consideration of specific human embryo research proposals for funding, the
NIH must address the profound moral and ethical issues raised by the use of human embryos in research and develop guidelines
to govern the review and conduct of Federally-funded research. Panel members will be asked to consider various areas
of research involving the human embryo and provide advice as to those areas they view to be acceptable for Federal funding,
areas that warrant additional review, and areas that are unacceptable for Federal support. For those areas of research
considered acceptable for Federal funding, the Panel will be asked to recommend specific guidelines for the review
and conduct of this research. Issues related to human germ-line gene modification are not within the Panel's purview.
The Panel's final report will be presented to the ACD for review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A critical part of the process of considering these issues is to gain an understanding of the diversity of beliefs and
opinions held about the moral status of the human embryo and about Federal funding of research involving the human
embryo. The NIH is seeking public comment on Federal funding of human embryo research for consideration by the Panel
and encourages interested individuals and organizations to share with the Panel their views and perspectives on
this important topic. Those who wish to submit written comments of any length should forward these to Steven Muller,
Ph.D., Chair, NIH Human Embryo Research Panel, c/o National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1, room 218, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. To ensure that public input is available to the Panel during its deliberations,
written comments should be received in advance of the Panel's fourth scheduled meeting, May 4, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each meeting of the Panel will also provide an opportunity for interested individuals and organizations to make brief
oral presentations to the Panel. During the first Panel meeting, public commentary was heard in a two-hour session.
To register to make an oral statement before the Panel, individuals and organizations should contact Ms. Peggy Schnoor
at the NIH by telephoning 301&hyph;496&hyph;1454 or by sending a facsimile message to 301&hyph;402&hyph;0280 or
301&hyph;402&hyph;1759. Oral statements must not exceed five minutes in length, and a copy of the remarks should
be forwarded to the above address one week in advance of the scheduled presentation date. Opportunities to present
statements will be determined by the order in which requests are received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIH will endeavor to provide seating for all members of the public who wish to attend the meetings. Individuals
are, however, asked to notify the NIH of their interest in attending by using the telephone or facsimile numbers listed
above. Individuals who require special accommodations are also asked to contact Ms. Schnoor at the above number.
General questions about the Panel or future meetings should also be directed to Ms. Schnoor.

Under the authority of section 561 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;321, the CMHS
will accept applications from States, political subdivisions of States, and Indian tribes for the purpose of providing
comprehensive community mental health services for children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance.
The grants will be used to support a broad array of community-based and family-focused services for children and adolescents
with serious emotional, behavioral, or mental disorders to enable communities to develop coordinated local systems
of care which involve mental health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice and other agencies, as appropriate.
Approximately $10&hyph;15 million will be available to support approximately 10&hyph;15 grants in FY 1994. The
receipt date for applications for FY 1994 funds is May 10, 1994. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number
for this program is

The Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbance
program was originally announced on April 15, 1993 (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Vol. 58, No. 71) and FY 1993 grant awards were made in September 1993. This program has subsequently been updated to:
(1) Provide further clarification of the definition of a community; (2) provide additional specifications on the
services that a grantee must provide in developing the system of care; (3) clarify that Indian tribal applicants receiving
grants under Section 103 of P.L. 93&hyph;638 are exempt from the restriction which prohibits the use of Federal funds
as a match; (4) provide greater explanation/clarification of the review criteria; and (5) incorporate other minor
technical changes related to individual contacts and addresses, and to help ensure overall clarity.

In 1983, in response to an application from the City of Elko for a sewage treatment facility, the lands described in
this notice were classified as suitable for lease with an option to purchase pursuant to the Recreation and Public
Purposes Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 869, 869&hyph;1 to 869&hyph;4). Disposal of these lands for a sewage treatment
facility is no longer authorized under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. Therefore, pursuant to section 7 of
the Taylor Grazing Act (48 Stat. 1272) and the authority delegated by Appendix 1 of Bureau of Land Management Manual
1203, Recreation and Public Purposes classification N&hyph;33727 is hereby terminated in its entirety:

 On November 8, 1993, the Department of the Interior received a ``petition'' to certify the People's Republic of China
and Taiwan under the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act for undermining the effectiveness of the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES, or the Convention). The U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (Service) is the agency responsible for the implementation of CITES in the United States. The request
alleged unlawful international trade by nationals of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, in the following
species: Asiatic black bears, Asian brown bears, Malayan sun bears, sloth bears, clouded leopards, leopards, snow
leopards, gibbons, and orangutans. The People's Republic of China and Taiwan were previously certified by the Secretary
of the Interior under the Pelly Amendment on September 7, 1993 for undermining the effectiveness of CITES for trade
in rhinoceros and tiger parts and products. This notice requests comments and information from the public on the following:
the international trade in Asiatic black bears, Asian brown bears, Malayan sun bears, sloth bears, clouded leopards,
leopards, snow leopards, gibbons, and orangutans, particularly involving the People's Republic of China and Taiwan;
the conservation status of these species in the wild; the effect of illegal trade on their populations; whether or
not actions of nationals of the People's Republic of China and/or Taiwan are undermining the effectiveness of CITES;
and any illegal trade in these species by nationals of other countries or entities. This information will be utilized
by the Service in determining whether the existing certification should be amended to cover these additional species.

On November 8, 1993, the Department of the Interior received a ``petition'' to certify the People's Republic of China
and Taiwan under the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act for undermining the effectiveness of the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service)
is the agency responsible for the implementation of CITES in the United States. Both the People's Republic of China
and Taiwan were previously certified by the Secretary under the Pelly Amendment on September 7, 1993 for undermining
the effectiveness of CITES for trade in rhinoceros and tiger parts and products. The November 8, 1993 letter requesting
certification was submitted by the following organizations: Environmental Investigation Agency, Earth Island
Institute, Animal Welfare Institute, Society for Animal Protective Legislation, Defenders of Wildlife, International
Primate Protection League, and World Society for the Protection of Animals. The letter provided information on the
alleged illegal international trade by nationals of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan in the following species:
Asiatic black bears, Asian brown bears, Malayan sun bears, sloth bears, clouded leopards, leopards, snow leopards,
gibbons, and orangutans. Although the November 8 letter focusses on the certification of China and Taiwan, international
trade in other countries with respect to these species is also alleged in the materials appended to the letter. Public
comment is requested on the international trade in each of these species, including, but not limited to, trade by nationals
of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, and other countries mentioned in the appended materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has reviewed and analyzed this supplemental data, in combination with other information in the Service's
files on trade in the species mentioned in the November 8 letter (Asiatic black bears, Asian brown bears, Malayan sun
bears, sloth bears, clouded leopards, leopards, snow leopards, gibbons, and orangutans). All of the species mentioned
in the letter are listed in CITES Appendix I, and are therefore considered to be species threatened with extinction
which are or may be affected by trade, among other factors. Because the species are listed in Appendix I, any primarily
commercial trade in these species is generally in violation of the Convention. The letter provided information to
support the allegation that illegal trade is continuing in specimens of these species, particularly involving nationals
of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is aware that habitat loss and fragmentation is a major factor threatening these and many other endangered
species. In addition, and in the context of the Pelly Amendment, the supplemental information alleges that these
species are also threatened with extinction by international trade, either as live animals or as parts and products.
All of these species have declined significantly in recent years, with some populations entirely extirpated and
others on the verge of extinction. The November 8 letter provides detailed information on both the internal and international
trade in parts and products of these species, involving nationals of both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan.
The letter provides information alleging that these species are threatened with extinction by the following types
of international trade, either as live animals or as parts and products:

Summary of Previous Pelly Amendment Certification of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 7, 1993, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt determined that nationals of the People's Republic
of China and Taiwan are engaging in trade in rhinoceros and tiger parts and products that diminishes the effectiveness
of CITES, and so notified the President of the United States. That determination constituted a certification under
the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, 22 U.S.C. 1978(a)(2), which provides that the Secretary
of the Interior shall make a certification to the President if he determines that nationals of a foreign country, directly
or indirectly, are engaged in trade or taking which diminishes the effectiveness of any international program for
the conservation of endangered or threatened species; CITES is such a program. Secretary Babbitt announced this
certification at the thirtieth meeting of the CITES Standing Committee, in Brussels, Belgium September 6&hyph;8,
1993; staff of the Service's Office of Management Authority (OMA) also participated in the meeting. The Standing
Committee made several recommendations to both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan on eliminating the illegal
trade in both rhinoceroses and tigers. In response to the Secretary of the Interior's certification, the Standing
Committee recommendations, and after bilateral discussions with both China and Taiwan, and careful deliberation
and evaluation, on November 5, 1993 the President: Reported to Congress on the certification; made several recommendations
to both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan; and required that unless measurable, verifiable, and substantial
progress is made by March, 1994, import prohibitions on trade with both governments would be necessary, as recommended
by the CITES Standing Committee. Since that time, two CITES missions have visited both the People's Republic of China
and Taiwan, and bilateral meetings have taken place. A U.S. government technical assistance mission from the Departments
of Interior and Justice will visit both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan in late February-early March. An
evaluation of progress and a preliminary decision on possible trade prohibitions is expected in March, 1994. The
thirty first CITES Standing Committee meeting will take place March 21&hyph;25 in Geneva, Switzerland, where the
issues of rhinoceros and tiger trade will also be discussed.

The Service has reviewed the November 8 letter, and finds that it contains sufficient information to warrant a consideration
of whether nationals of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan are undermining the effectiveness of CITES by engaging
trade or taking of endangered species other than rhinoceroses and tigers. Both the People's Republic of China and
Taiwan have been previously certified to the President under the Pelly Amendment for trade in rhinoceros and tiger
parts and products. If the Secretary of the Interior finds that nationals of the People's Republic of China and/or
Taiwan are diminishing the effectiveness of CITES by trading in additional species, the existing certification
would be amended accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice requests comments and information from the public on the following: The international trade in the species
discussed, particularly involving the People's Republic of China and Taiwan; the conservation status of these species
in the wild; the effect of illegal trade on their populations; whether or not actions of nationals of the People's Republic
of China and/or Taiwan are undermining the effectiveness of CITES; and on any illegal trade in these species by nationals
of other countries or entities. This information will be utilized by the Service in determining whether to recommend
that the Secretary amend the existing certification.

 The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of preliminary antidumping investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;684&hyph;685
(Preliminary) under section 733(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673b(a)) to determine whether there is a reasonable
indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, or
the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports from Colombia and
Ecuador of fresh cut roses, provided for in subheading 0603.10.60 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United
States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value. The Commission must complete preliminary
antidumping investigations in 45 days, or in this case by March 31, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is announcing a public workshop on reliability assessments of safety system
designs having passive features. The purpose of the workshop is to review the present status of available methodology
for assessing safety systems having passive features, to discuss possible improvements in these methods and to develop
guidelines for performing meaningful assessments of such systems. This action is being taken to initiate a dialogue
on this important topic and to provide the opportunity for early public participation in the development of review
methods and criteria for passive safety systems. In addition to open public participation in this workshop, the NRC
is inviting all known interested parties to attend.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this workshop is to initiate a dialogue on practical approaches for assessing the reliability of engineering
systems comprised partially or completely of passive components and/or subsystems such as for example gravity fed
emergency water supplies. Even though the workshop focus will be on the generic issues associated with nuclear reactor
safety systems having passive features, it is also intended to draw on relevant experience in engineering fields
other than nuclear such as the chemical industry or NASA's space programs. Another objective of this workshop is to
discuss ways for improving our understanding of the sensitivity of functional success of passive systems to changes
in controlling system parameters. Examples of such changes include variations in heat transfer coefficient and
driving pressure (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 -->
D
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
P) across check valves under conditions of natural circulation and low driving head. Due to the preliminary nature
of the NRC's reviews of the advanced reactor designs planning to utilize passive safety features, the workshop will
not include discussions of specific proprietary design information. The results of the workshop will provide an
input to assessing the need for additional research into understanding passive system reliability in integral designs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Regulatory needs for assessments of passive safety system reliability. What ingredients must logically be included
in the quantification of functional reliability of passive systems? What results (e.g., uncertainty analysis)
should be presented and documented?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What is meant by the reliability of a passive safety system and by the uncertainty in its reliability? What is the
best way of determining this uncertainty and of incorporating experimental information to reduce the uncertainty?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Discussion of past efforts to assess the reliability of reactor systems that utilize passive features. What methods
have proven successful in past efforts in light of stated needs (Item I) and what were their shortcomings?

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has submitted for OMB approval amendments to Regulation
14A and Regulation S&hyph;K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 20a&hyph;1 through 20a&hyph;3 and
Form N&hyph;14 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``1940 Act'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation 14A, and Schedule 14A thereto, sets forth general requirements for the solicitation of proxies. Approximately
8,000 respondents, other than management investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, prepare proxies with
an estimated compliance time of 89 hours per registrant. Regulation 14A and Schedule 14A, currently and as proposed
to be amended, have provisions applicable to investment companies. However, the burden hours for proxy filings by
investment companies are imposed under Rules 20a&hyph;1 through 20a&hyph;3 discussed below and the Commission
does not anticipate any changes to the burden imposed under Regulation 14A or Schedule 14A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation S&hyph;K includes generally applicable disclosure items for registration statement forms, proxies,
and other documents filed under the federal securities laws, and has an estimated compliance burden of one hour for
administrative convenience because it does not directly impose filing requirements. The Commission does not anticipate
that the propose amendments will change the burden associated with Regulation S&hyph;K.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rules 20a&hyph;1 through 20a&hyph;3 set forth various specific requirements applicable to the solicitation of
proxies by investment companies. About 970 investment companies prepare proxies with an estimated compliance time
of 97.2 hours per registrant. The Commission expects the amendments to decrease the burden by one hour, for a total
compliance time of 96.2 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
N&hyph;14 is the registration statement for use by investment companies to register securities under the Securities
Act of 1933 issued in mergers and other forms of business combination. Approximately 95 registrants filed Form N&hyph;14
in 1992, with an estimated compliance time of 2,500.3 hours per registrant. The maximum additional burden imposed
by the amendments is estimated to be one hour, for a total of 2,502.3 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General comments regarding the estimated burden hours should be directed to Gary Waxman at the address below. Any
comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with Commission rules and
forms should be directed to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549 and Gary Waxman, Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Budget, (paperwork

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et. seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Securities and Exchange Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget request for approval
of extensions on the following currently approved rules and forms: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form N&hyph;8f is the form prescribed for use by certain registered investment companies requesting orders of the
Commission declaring that they have ceased to be investment companies. The form takes approximately 6 hours to complete.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form N&hyph;23C&hyph;1 is a form on which closed-end investment companies report repurchases of their own securities.
The form requires about one hour to fill out on each occasion, up to twelve times per year, on the part of approximately
4 companies that undertake such repurchase transactions each year. Total annual burden hours are estimate to be 23.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 6e&hyph;2 grants investment companies offering scheduled premium and single premium variable life insurance
contracts exemptions from the Investment Company Act of 1940. Only management accounts that register to sell contracts
under Rule 6e&hyph;2 have a reporting burden, estimated to be approximately 111 annual hours per respondent, imposed
under paragraph (b)(9) of the rule. Since 1988, there have been no filings under paragraph (b)(9) of rule 6e&hyph;2
by existing management accounts, and separate accounts now are being organized as trust accounts, which are not subject
to the reporting requirements, rather than as management accounts. Without the rule, management companies that
offer variable insurance contracts and their sponsoring life insurers would have to file individual exemptive applications
in addition to a registration statement in order to obtain the relief needed to sell the contracts. This process would
be burdensome on both the life insurer and the Commission's staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 17a&hyph;8 exempts certain mergers or consolidations involving investment companies from the restrictions
on transactions between affiliates set forth in Section 17(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The rule annually
requires approximately 1.5 hours of recordkeeping by each of approximately 17 companies estimated to be involved
in such a merger or consolidation each year, for a total of 26 annual burden hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 17f&hyph;1 requires that a custodial contract and an accountant's certificate be filed with the Commission
in connection with the placement or maintenance of the assets of a registered management investment company in the
custody of a member of a national securities exchange. The rule requires each respondent to spend about 4 hours meeting
reporting requirements annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General comments regarding the estimated burden hours should be directed to Gary Waxman at the address below. Any
comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with Commission rules and
forms should be directed to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549 and Gary Waxman, Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Budget, (Paperwork
Reduction Act No. 3235&hyph;0157, 3235&hyph;0230, 3235&hyph;0177, 3235&hyph;0235, and 3235&hyph;0222), room

(a) If the Committee has reason to believe a violation has occurred and the member or associated person does not dispute
the violation, the Committee may suggest that the member or associated person submit a letter containing an acceptance
of a finding of violations, a waiver of all rights of appeal to the National Business Conduct Committee (and any review
thereof by the Board of Governors), the Securities and Exchange Commission and the courts or to otherwise challenge
or contest the validity of the Order issued if the letter is accepted, and a consent to the imposition of sanctions.
The letter shall describe the act or practice engaged in or omitted; the rule, regulation or statutory provision violated;
and the sanction to be imposed therefore. If the Committee then concludes that the Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and
Consent is appropriate and should be accepted, it shall be submitted to the National Business Conduct Committee.
If the letter is accepted by the National Business Conduct Committee or a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Business Conduct Committee of the NASD (``NBCC'') is composed of participating members of the first
year class of the NASD Board of Governors (``Board'') plus an elected Chair and Vice-Chair from the Board's second
year class. The members of the NBCC are sent a weekly package (``weekly mailings'') for review on proposed Acceptance,
Waiver, and Consents (``AWCs''), Minor Rule Violations Letters, and Offers of Settlement. The NBCC also reviews,
on a weekly basis, all disciplinary decisions of the District Business Conduct Committees and the Market Surveillance
Committee. All matters are first reviewed by the Chair and Vice-Chair of the NBCC and then reviewed by the other members
of the NBCC along with the recommendations of the Chair and Vice-Chair.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD has determined that the weekly mailings to the NBCC require a substantial commitment of time of NBCC members
and that the review by NBCC members of all the foregoing matters is unnecessary and unduly burdensome. In order to reduce
the amount of materials which must be read by NBCC members, the NASD proposes to amend Article II, Sections 10(a), 10(b),
and 11(e)
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 of the Code of Procedure (``Code'') to allow the NBCC to designate a Subcommittee composed of members of the NBCC to
review AWCs, Minor Rule Violations Letters, and Offers of Settlement in all instances other than matters that are
outside the NASD Sanction Guidelines
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 or where the designated Subcommittee, in its discretion, otherwise believes full NBCC review is appropriate. The
NASD intends that, initially, the Subcommittee designated by the Committee will consist of the Committee Chair and
Vice-Chair, but may modify the composition of the Subcommittee in the future.,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD is, therefore, proposing to amend Article II, Sections 10(a) and 10(b) of the Code, to allow acceptance and
rejections of AWCs and Minor Rule Violations Letters to be made by a Subcommittee designated by the NBCC as an alternative
to full NBCC review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD is also proposing to amend Article II, section 11(e) of the Code to allow acceptances and rejections of Offers
of Settlement to be made by a Subcommittee designated by the NBCC as an alternative to full NBCC review. The NASD is also
proposing to delete the phrase ``by a majority vote'' from Article II, section 11(e) of the Code. The NASD considers
the phrase ``by a majority vote'' to be confusing since a majority vote is always required by an NASD review body acting
pursuant to the Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(8) of the Act in
that the proposed rule change provides for fair procedures for the disciplining of members and persons associated
with members. The proposal enhances the NASD's disciplinary procedures with respect to AWCs, Minor Rule Violations
Letters, and Offers of Settlement by facilitating the review of such matters by the NBCC.

SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applicants seek an amendment to a prior order that permits Money Market to enter into repurchase agreements with FNBC.
The prior order limits the collateral for the repurchase agreements to U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, or Bonds, with
remaining maturities of one year or less, and valued at least equal to 102% of the maximum amount of a Fund's net assets
that could be invested in such repurchase agreements. The order will not limit the maturity of the collateral and,
with respect to the amount of the collateral, will provide only that the repurchase agreements must be fully collateralized
within the meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Funds are open-end, diversified management investment companies. Each Fund is a money market fund that maintains
a net asset value of $1.00 per share for purchases and redemptions and, pursuant to rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act, uses
the amortized cost method of valuing its securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. FNBC is the investment adviser for each of the Funds. FNBC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Chicago Corporation,
a registered bank holding company, is a commercial bank offering a range of banking and investment services. The Bank
of New York acts as the custodian for each of the Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Cash Management invests in short-term money market obligations, including repurchase agreements with respect
to such securities with registered or unregistered securities dealers or banks that have total assets in excess of
$1 billion. Money Market is divided into two separate portfolios, the Money Market Series and the Government Series
(each of which is referred to as a ``Fund''). The Money Market Series invests in short-term money market obligations,
including repurchase agreements with banks or primary government securities dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. The Government Series invests only in short-term securities issued or guaranteed as to principal
and interest by the U.S. Government, and repurchase agreements with respect to such securities with selected registered
or unregistered securities dealers or banks that have total assets in excess of $1 billion. Treasury Cash Management
invests at least 65% of the value of its net assets in U.S. Treasury securities and repurchase agreements in respect
thereof and the remainder of its net assets in other securities guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S.
Government and repurchase agreements in respect thereof with registered or unregistered securities dealers or
banks that have total assets in excess of $1 billion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each Fund's shares are purchased primarily by clients of FNBC and its affiliates, including qualified custody,
agency, and trust accounts, through their accounts with FNBC and its affiliates. Each Fund's shares may be purchased
through automatic investment transactions. In these transactions, FNBC, as agent, follows the standing instructions
of such clients and automatically invests excess cash balances in the clients' accounts in shares of one or more of
the Funds.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Currently, these ``sweep'' transactions are effected automatically by computer each Fund business day as the next
determined net asset value. The machine processing required to tabulate the day's transactions in such clients'
accounts and other shareholder accounts, however, is completed later in the day (normally no earlier than 11 p.m.,
New York time) when the daily processing for FNBC's accounting system is completed (the ``Completion Time''). Therefore,
total assets to be invested in each Fund through the ``sweep'' program each day are not known until that evening and
are invested in each Fund at the respective net asset values determined on the following day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the standing instructions of FNBC's clients, the computer program also provides for the automatic
redemption of Fund shares held in an account as of the next determined net asset value if the cash balance in the account
is less than the minimum balance specified by the client.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. The current operation of the ``sweep'' program makes the Funds materially less attractive to FNBC's clients because
they lose a day's income on funds invested through the program and, for ``sweeps'' accomplished on a Friday, lose a
weekend's income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. To correct this problem, Money Market and FNBC (the ``original Applicants'') applied for and received an order
(the ``Order'') of the SEC under section 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act on January 26, 1993, exempting them from section 17(a)
of the Act to permit Money Market to enter into repurchase agreements with FNBC or an affiliate subject to certain conditions.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 To date, however, Money Market has not entered into repurchase agreements with FNBC and therefore is not relying on
the Order. The application seeks to amend the Order to: (1) Add additional Funds with investment policies and procedures
similar to those of Money Market as applicants; and (2) amend condition seven to the Order.

7. Condition seven to the Order provides that, during the operation of the ``sweep'' program, collateral maintained
in a subcustodian account in the name of each Fund shall be ``comprised only of U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes or Bonds,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
with remaining maturities of one year or less
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and valued at least equal to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
102% of the Maximum Purchase Amount
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' (emphasis added). The ``Maximum Purchase Amount'' is the amount of a Fund's net assets that may be invested pursuant
to the Order. This amount is based on a percentage that may change from time to time, subject to the agreement of the applicants,
but may not exceed 15% of a Fund's net assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicants propose to amend condition seven to eliminate the requirement that the securities comprising the collateral
have ``remaining maturities of one year or less.'' Applicants believe that the provisions of rule 2a&hyph;7 relating
to remaining maturity are not applicable to securities underlying fully collateralized repurchase agreements.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 FNBC's experience is that the Funds will be able to obtain a higher yield on repurchase agreements using collateral
with remaining maturities of greater than one year than otherwise would be the case.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Applicants also propose to amend condition seven to eliminate the requirement that the securities comprising
the collateral be valued at least equal to ``102% of the Maximum Purchase Amount.'' Applicants believe that neither
rule 2a&hyph;7 nor relevant regulatory pronouncements require the collateral for the repurchase agreements to
be valued at 102% of the Maximum Purchase Amount. Applicants propose to substitute the requirement that the collateral
be at least equal to the amount (the ``Required Collateral Amount'') necessary to collateralize fully (within the
meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7) a repurchase agreement in an amount equal to the Maximum Purchase Amount. Applicants believe
that maintaining additional collateral beyond that necessary to collateralize fully a repurchase agreement reduces
the relevant Fund's yield on the repurchase agreement to the detriment of the Fund's shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. To permit FNBC, as each Fund's investment adviser, to invest anticipated net assets attributable to the ``sweep''
program on the same day that they are available for investment (despite the fact that the exact amount thereof will
not be known until after the time for investment that day), FNBC or an affiliate proposes to enter into overnight repurchase
agreements with each Fund. Such assets would be invested in shares of a Fund as of the time the Fund determined its net
asset value (the ``Pricing Time'') on the same day the sweep occurs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Each Fund proposes to enter into a master repurchase agreement with FNBC or one of its affiliates, which is substantially
the same as the industry standard master repurchase agreement promulgated by the Public Securities Association,
covering all repurchase agreement transactions (the ``Master Repurchase Agreement'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. To facilitate the repurchase transaction where the exact amount of the overnight repurchase agreement and, consequently,
the required collateral is not known until the following day, FNBC, at no cost to the Funds, will maintain at all times
in a segregated sub-custodian account in the name of each Fund the Required Collateral Amount. Each Fund will promptly
notify FNBC of any increase or decrease in its net asset value and FNBC will adjust the amount of collateral maintained
in the segregated account daily so that it at least equals the Required Collateral Amount for each Fund. The relevant
Fund will have a perfected security interest in the repurchase agreement collateral held in such account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. If the cash balances swept into a Fund equalled the Maximum Purchase Amount, the required amount of collateral
already would be held in the Fund's segregated sub-custodian account with FNBC's Trust Department and the Fund would
have a perfected security interest in all such collateral notwithstanding the fact that the actual amount of the repurchase
transaction would not be known until the computer records were received the next morning. If such cash balances were
less than the Maximum Purchase Amount, the repurchase transaction would be over-collateralized. If such cash balances
swept exceeded the Maximum Purchase Amount, the excess amount would remain uninvested. FNBC, however, believes
that its experience in operating the ``sweep'' program and its daily consultations with other departments should
limit the amount of funds being swept and thus potentially held uninvested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. FNBC's Trust Department will act as each Fund's sub-custodian pursuant to a sub-custodian agreement approved
by each Fund's Board of Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not '`interested persons,'' as defined
in the Act, of either FNBC or the Fund.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Each Fund's assets held by FNBC's Trust Department will be maintained in a segregated custodial account established
on its behalf in accordance with the rules and standards of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Act. FNBC's Trust
Department would receive the eligible securities transferred to it in its capacity as sub-custodian for each Fund
and hold them in a manner complying with the requirements of section 17(f) of the Act. After the Completion Time that
evening, for a particular fund, the records maintained by FNBC for its clients' accounts and by FNBC's Trust Department
in its capacity as the Fund's sub-custodian would show:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) For FNBC's client accounts, a cash entry for the amount of Fund shares purchased or redeemed and a corresponding
entry to the client accounts for the number of Fund shares purchased or redeemed as of the Pricing Time through operation
of the computer ``sweep'' program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For the Fund's sub-custodian account, all purchase and sale transactions and the net cash proceeds, if any, received
by the Fund through the operation of the ``sweep'' (or, conversely, the net redemption proceeds paid or payable by
the Fund if there were net redemptions). In addition, the Fund's sub-custodian account would reflect the specific
amount in fact invested in the particular transaction (including the ownership of the securities securing the repurchase
agreement). If the ``sweep'' had resulted in unanticipated net redemptions for the Fund, the relevant sub-custodian
account would reflect this fact and show no ownership of any of such securities transferred by FNBC or its affiliates
to the account, since (contrary to expectations) none of the Fund's assets had been used to purchase the securities.
To the extent that transferred securities exceeded the Fund's assets that were available for investment (as shown
by the results of the day's computer processing), FNBC or the appropriate affiliate would be shown to be owner of such
securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. After the Completion Time, FNBC would transmit to the Fund's transfer agent records relating to these automatic
investment transactions. The transfer agent's records would show an entry to each of the corresponding shareholder
accounts for the number of Fund shares automatically purchased or redeemed as of the Pricing Time through operation
of the ``sweep.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Each Fund will purchase only securities in which it may invest as described in its prospectus and statement of additional
information and as limited by rule 2a&hyph;7. The Master Repurchase Agreement into which each Fund proposes to enter
will be collateralized only by U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds. The transactions will comply with the guidelines
set forth in Investment Company Act Release No. 13005 (February 2, 1983) and will be collateralized fully as that term
is defined in rule 2a&hyph;7. The Master Repurchase Agreement will be subject to annual approval, with respect to
each Fund, by the Fund's Board of Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not ``interested persons''
(as defined in the Act) of the Fund or FNBC or its affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. The transactions would be ``repurchase agreements'' for purposes of Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. These statutes provide that, if
the bankruptcy of the counterparty occurs, the repurchase agreement can be liquidated without being subject to the
potential delay associated with the automatic stay or similar provisions of these statutes. If the transactions
were not ``repurchase agreements'' as defined under those statutes, the Fund might encounter significant liquidity
problems if a large percentage of its assets were invested in repurchase agreements with a bankrupt counterparty.

18. Cash Management, the Money Market Series, the Government Series, and Treasury Cash Management currently invest
approximately 33%, 33%, 25%, and 50%, respectively, of their net assets on an overnight basis. Each Fund's average
daily portfolio maturity customarily is between 40 and 60 days. Applicants intend to limit the Maximum Purchase Amount
at a level that they believe should avoid reducing average daily portfolio maturity and thus the yield for a Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. FNBC will continue to solicit independent quotes from third parties for the proposed ``sweep'' transactions,
but to date FNBC has been unable to find any unaffiliated entity willing to engage in such transactions on a basis as
favorable to the Funds as the proposed arrangement with FNBC. The repurchase agreement counterpart will not know
until the next day the amount, if any, of such transactions. This delay results because the daily processing for FNBC's
accounting system normally is completed well into the night of the day the order is placed and the actual amount to be
invested in the repurchase transaction is not known and, thus, monies in respect thereof cannot be transmitted until
the next morning. Unaffiliated third parties will not agree to operate in this ``look back'' manner with the Fund on
a basis as favorable to the Fund as the proposed arrangement with FNBC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Before any repurchase agreements are entered into pursuant to the exemption, the participating Fund or FNBC must
obtain and document competitive quotations from at least two other dealers with respect to repurchase agreements
that are comparable in terms of size, maturity, and collateral, except that if quotations are unavailable from two
such dealers only one other competitive quotation is required. In addition, the transactions for which quotations
are sought will be conventional overnight repurchase agreements in which the funds would be transferred by the participating
Fund on the same day that the transaction is entered into, and then returned by the counterpart on the following day.
Before entering into a transaction pursuant to the exemption, a determination will be required that the income to
be earned from the repurchase agreement is at least equal to that available from the other dealers from which quotes
were obtained. As set forth in the application, applicants enter into repurchase agreements on an ongoing basis and,
therefore, believe they are capable of obtaining such quotes.

1. Section 17(a) of the Act, among other things, generally prohibits certain entities affiliated with an registered
investment company, when acting as principal, from knowingly selling to or purchasing from the investment company,
any security. Among the entities precluded from dealing as principal with a registered investment company under
section 17(a) are any affiliated person of the investment company and any affiliated person of an affiliated person
of the investment company. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines the term ``affiliated person'' of an investment company
to include any investment adviser of such company. Therefore, FNBC, as each Fund's investment adviser, and its affiliates
are subject to the prohibitions contained in section 17(a) with respect to the Fund.

of [the Act] or of any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of [the Act].''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that ``notwithstanding [section 17(a)], any person may file with the Commission
an application for an order exempting a proposed transaction *&blank;*&blank;* from one or more provisions of that
subsection. The Commission shall grant such application and issue such order of exemption if evidence establishes
that *&blank;*&blank;* (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received,
are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (2) the proposed transaction
is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement
and reports filed under [the Act]; and (3) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of [the
Act].''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each Fund believes that the relief requested is appropriate and in the public interest because it will permit the
Fund to invest at a favorable price net assets attributable to the ``sweep'' program on the same day that such assets
are available for investment. Applicants believe that a more attractive ``sweep'' program will result in increased
assets for the Funds. A larger asset base for a Fund will benefit all Fund shareholders by reducing the amount of Fund
expenses indirectly borne by each shareholder, thereby increasing investors' returns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. FNBC and its affiliates are aware of the potential conflict of interest inherent in the operation of the ``sweep''
program if the proposed relief is granted. FNBC, therefore, has established procedures and conditions to be followed
by its employees and agents to prevent any overreaching on the part of any person that could act to the detriment of the
Funds and to ensure that each transaction is effected on a reasonable and fair basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A Fund's overnight position should not necessarily reduce its yield. If the operation of the proposed ``sweep''
program shortens a Fund's average daily portfolio maturity, the effect of such reduction would be minimal because:
(i) the Fund currently maintains a relatively short average daily portfolio maturity; (ii) as FNBC develops more
experience operating the ``sweep'' program, FNBC will be able to manage the maturity of that portion of the Fund's
assets held outside the sub-custodian account for the program so as to provide optimal liquidity levels; and (iii)
upon receipt of such assets currently, the Fund has invested such assets in overnight or very short-term obligations
in any event, but such investment occurs one day later. Thus, applicant believe that any effect on yield as a result
of the proposed relief would be negligible. In addition, operation pursuant to the independent pricing mechanism
set forth in condition 8 should provide yields from ``sweep'' investments that are no lower than similar non-sweep
Fund investments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Based on the arguments set forth above, applicants believe that the requested relief is necessary and appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act. Applicants also believe that the terms of the proposed transactions, including the consideration
to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned,
that the proposed transactions are consistent with the policy of each Fund, as set forth in the Fund's registration
statement and reports filed under the Act, and that the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes
of the Act.

Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following
conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. No. FNBC or affiliate ``sweep'' account client will be permitted to affect a transaction for a Fund after the sweep
has occurred and the Fund's net assets value has been computed for that day.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The legal or compliance department of, and internal and outside auditors for, FNBC or its affiliates will prepare
guidelines for FNBC and affiliate personnel to ensure that the transactions described herein comply with the conditions
set forth herein and that the integrity of the program is maintained. Each Fund's independent public accountants
will verify assets held in each sub-custodian account in accordance with rule 17f&hyph;2 under the Act. The legal
or compliance department and auditors will periodically monitor the activities of FNBC and its affiliates in connection
with the operation of the ``sweep'' program to ensure that the conditions set forth in the application are adhered
to.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The terms of the relief will be disclosed fully in each Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information.
A schedule of all transactions with FNBC and its affiliates will be filed with each semi-annual report filed by a Fund
with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. FNBC will provide each Fund's Board of Trustees
with a full report of the transactions under the ``sweep'' program, as described herein, no less frequently than quarterly.
FNBC also will provide each Fund's Board of Trustees with a statement that, as the Fund's investment adviser, it determined
the principal transactions to be necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Funds and FNBC will maintain such records with respect to those transactions conducted pursuant to the exemption
as may be necessary to confirm compliance with the conditions to the requested relief. In this regard, each Fund will
maintain an itemized daily record of repurchase agreement transactions entered into pursuant to the exemption,
showing for each transaction: that it has entered into the transaction; the entity with which it has entered into the
transaction; the purchase and repurchase prices; the type and amount of collateral; the date fixed for termination
of the transaction; and the time and date of the transaction. For each transaction, such records also shall document
the quotations received from other dealers in accordance with condition no. 8, including: The names of the dealers;
the prices quoted; and the times and dates the quotations were received. The records required by this condition will
be maintained and preserved in the same manner as records required under rule 31a&hyph;1(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Maximum Purchase Amount will be the percentage of each Fund's net assets upon which the applicants from time
to time may agree, which percentage may fluctuate but shall not exceed 15%. As to a particular Fund on a particular day,
the amount invested pursuant to the exemption will not exceed the amount swept into such Fund on such day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. All records pertaining to the sweep program will be preserved for a period of not less than six years, the first two
years in an easily accessible place, from the end of the fiscal year in which any sweep transaction occurred.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. In connection with overnight repurchase agreement transactions pursuant to the Master Repurchase Agreement,
FNBC will maintain at all times during operation of the ``sweep'' program in a segregated sub-custodian account in
the name of each Fund collateral comprised only of U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes or Bonds valued at least equal to the Required
Collateral Amount. In addition, FNBC or its affiliates will transfer such collateral through the book entry system
of the Federal Reserve and, in connection therewith, the Fund's sub-custodian account with FNBC's Trust Department
will be designated by Fedwire as the recipient of such securities and FNBC's internal records and written confirmations
will indicate that the collateral is being held on behalf and in such Fund's name. The relevant Fund thereby will acquire
a security interest in the collateral.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Before any transaction may be conducted pursuant to the exemption, the participating Fund or FNBC must obtain such
information as it deems necessary to determine that the price test set forth below has been satisfied. Before any repurchase
agreements are entered into pursuant to the exemption, the participating Fund or FNBC must obtain and document competitive
quotations from at least two other dealers with respect to repurchase agreements comparable to the type of repurchase
agreement involved (including size, which would be at least equal to the Maximum Purchase Amount, maturity and collateral),
except that if quotations are unavailable from two such dealers only one other competitive quotation is required.
In addition, the transactions for which quotations are sought will be conventional overnight repurchase agreements
in which the funds would be transferred by the participating Fund on the same day that the transaction is entered into,
and then returned by the counterparty on the following day. Before entering into a transaction pursuant to the exemption,
a determination will be required in each instance, based upon the information available to the participating Fund
and FNBC, that the income to be earned from the repurchase agreement is at least equal to that available from the other
dealers from which quotes were obtained.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council is a twenty-one member Federal advisory council that advises the Coast Guard on matters relating to the
prevention of vessel collisions, rammings, and groundings, including, but not limited to: Inland Rules of the Road,
International Rules of the Road, navigation regulations and equipment, routing measures, marine information,
diving safety, and aids to navigation systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applications will be considered for seven (7) expiring terms. The Council consists of 21 members who have expertise,
knowledge and experience in the Navigation Rules of the Road (International and Inland), aids to navigation, navigational
safety equipment, vessel traffic service, and traffic separation schemes and vessel routing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To achieve the balance of membership required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Coast Guard is especially
interested in receiving applications from minorities and women. To assure balanced representation of subject matter
expertise, members are chosen, insofar as practical, from the following groups: (1) Recognized experts and leaders
in organizations having an active interest in the Rules of the Road and vessel and port safety; (2) representatives
of owners and operators of vessels, professional mariners, recreational boaters, and the recreational boating
industry; (3) individuals with an interest in maritime law; and (4) Federal and state officials with responsibility
for vessel and port safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three-year membership term begins July 1, 1994, and assuming that the Council is continued beyond September 30,1995,
will expire June 30, 1997. Those persons who have submitted previous applications must reapply as no applications
received prior to this solicitation will be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council meets twice each year at various sites in the continental United States. Members serve without compensation
from the Federal Government, although travel reimbursement and per diem may be provided.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard announces it will be participating in a meeting sponsored by Underwriters Laboratories to discuss
the development of a consensus standard for inflatable personal flotation devices (PFDs) for use on recreational
boats. The technical requirements for both the inflatable PFD and its inflation mechanism will be discussed. This
meeting is intended for technical experts knowledgeable in the field who have volunteered to participate in the development
effort and so notified the Coast Guard or Underwriters Laboratories.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9, 211.41 and 211.45, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) has received a request for a waiver of compliance with certain requirements of the Federal safety laws and regulations.
The individual petition is described below, including the party seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved,
the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Renfe Talgo of America, Incorporated (RTAX) requests waivers of compliance with certain provisions of the Railroad
Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR part 223) under Docket Number RSGM&hyph;94&hyph;2 and Railroad Safety Appliance
Standards (49 CFR part 231), under Docket Number SA&hyph;94&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RTAX seeks these waivers in order to permit operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TALGO Pendular Train (TALGO) under two conditions. It is intended that the train will be operated (1) in non-revenue
demonstration runs and (2) in revenue service as part of a regularly scheduled service operated by National Railroad
Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) in the Pacific Northwest High Speed Rail Corridor. The non-revenue demonstration
runs of the TALGO train will involve a cross-country movement from its assembly point in Washington, DC to Seattle,
Washington, in March 1994. It is anticipated that the train will be on public display in Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago,
St. Louis, and Seattle. The revenue operations in passenger service are to be conducted as part of Amtrak's regularly
scheduled service between Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, which are scheduled to begin in April 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trainset would be comprised of 12 TALGO Pendular cars. The 12 cars will include 1 head-end power car which will not
carry passengers, 8 passenger coach cars, 1 cafeteria car, 1 dining car, and 1 rear-end service car which will not carry
passengers. The TALGO equipment has a total weight of approximately 400,000 pounds. With the Amtrak locomotive,
the total length of the train will be approximately 575 feet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RTAX petition seeks a waiver from compliance with the Railroad Glazing Standards, (49 CFR 223.15(b)), which requires
that all side facing glazing on passenger cars must meet the FRA Type II testing criteria. RTAX states that the side
facing glazing of the TALGO train may in fact meet the FRA requirements for FRA Type II, but it has not been subjected
to the test specified in the regulation. The windows in the sides of the cars are double glazed with tempered safety
glass. Each layer is 6 mm. (.24 inches) thick with an air space in between the two layers. RTAX says that there is not sufficient
time to retrofit windows in the TALGO train prior to shipment from Spain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RTAX petition seeks a waiver from compliance of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards, (49 CFR 231.14) and sections
2 and 4 of the Safety Appliance Act (45 U.S.C. 2 and 4), which requires that each passenger car must be equipped with side
handholds, end handholds, and uncoupling levers. The passenger cars have side handholds at the doors for the assistance
of passengers, but there are no side handholds or end handholds which the rules contemplate for use in switching operations
or coupling and uncoupling. RTAX states that the 12 cars in the TALGO train constitute a single unit, in that the cars
will not be uncoupled from one another, except at specified maintenance facilities. The individual cars are joined
by swivel type traction couplers which will not uncouple in normal operations and because of this configuration there
is no need for uncoupling levers. Standard AAR Type E couplers will be installed at the ends of the front and rear service
cars.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties are invited to participate in this proceeding by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with this proceeding since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number SA&hyph;94&hyph;1) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
Federal Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications
received before March 17, 1994 will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that
date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available
for examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.&hyph;5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street
SW., Washington, DC 20590.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 8, 1993, the President signed the ``North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act.'' The Customs modernization portion of this Act (Title VI of Public Law 103&hyph;182), popularly known as the
Customs Modernization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act or ``Mod Act,'' became effective when it was signed. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the public with a general ``Mod Act'' briefing, share ``strawmen'' implementation proposals, and invite
informal dialogue relative to implementation plans and issues, Customs will hold an open meeting in Washington on
March 8&hyph;9, 1994. Between 10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. on March 8, a general briefing covering operational, automation
and enforcement issues will be conducted. This general briefing will be similar to those conducted in Washington
on February 9 and 10, 1994. Following the general briefing, senior Customs managers will conduct a series of presentations
focussing on their proposals for implementing specific Mod Act provisions. Among the topics to be discussed in these
focussed sessions will be regulatory audit, drawback, penalties, carriers, importer activity summary statements
and reconciliation. Participants will be given ample opportunity to ask questions and provide suggestions during
each session. Persons planning to attend are requested to pre-register by FAX with Mr. Dale Snell at 202&hyph;482&hyph;6994.
Individuals not having access to facsimile equipment may pre-register by calling Mr. Snell at 202&hyph;482&hyph;6990.
To meet Commerce Department building access requirements, attendees are encouraged to arrive approximately 30
minutes in advance of the meeting. Each individual attending Customs Mod Act Implementation meeting on March 8 and
9, 1994, will be required to sign a Commerce Department register and present photo-identification.

First Union National Bank of North Carolina, Charlotte, North Carolina (First Union) filed a notice with the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on November 1, 1993 (First Union Notice), pursuant to 12 CFR 5.34,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 advising the OCC of First Union's intent to establish three operating subsidiaries. The First Union Notice describes
First Union's intent to acquire, through First Union's proposed operating subsidiaries, two affiliated investment
advisory companies, Lieber &amp; Company, a New York general partnership, and Evergreen Asset Management Corp.,
a Delaware corporation, (collectively referred to as ``Lieber'').

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC's regulation concerning operating subsidiaries, &sect;5.34, provides that national banks may establish
or acquire operating subsidiaries to engage in activities that are part of or incidental to the business of banking.
Where a national bank intends to engage in new activities in an operating subsidiary, it must notify the OCC. The OCC
reviews the bank's proposal to determine whether the proposed activities are legally permissible for a national
bank's operating subsidiary and to ensure that the proposal is consistent with prudent banking principles and OCC
policy which considers customer needs and fair treatment.

Mellon Bank, N.A., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Mellon) filed a notice with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC) on December 30, 1993 (Mellon Notice), pursuant to &sect;5.34, advising the OCC of Mellon's intent to establish
certain operating subsidiaries. The Mellon Notice describes Mellon's intent to acquire, through operating subsidiaries,
most of the assets, operations and activities of The Dreyfus Corporation, a New York corporation (Dreyfus). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The First Union and Mellon Notices propose activities for operating subsidiaries that have been approved for national
banks. The magnitude of the Mellon transaction, however, is significant. Because the First Union Notice involves
the acquisition of entities that engage in activities similar to Dreyfus, the OCC considers it appropriate to consolidate
the two notices for the purpose of soliciting public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although notices filed pursuant to &sect;5.34 do not require public comment under existing OCC regulations, the
OCC has reserved the right, pursuant to &sect;5.2(b), to adopt procedures different from those specifically provided
in its corporate applications regulations if the OCC deems such actions appropriate in acting on a particular application
or filing. The OCC considers it appropriate to seek comments from the public concerning the First Union and Mellon
Notices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First Union has assets of approximately $20 billion. Both First Union and its holding company, First Union Corporation
(FTU), which has assets of approximately $71 billion, already have substantial involvement in trust and investment
activities, including mutual fund administration, brokerage, master trust and custody, institutional investment
management and personal trust. FTU currently administers approximately $43 billion in assets and manages approximately
$27 billion in assets. The Evergreen family of 15 mutual funds currently has assets of approximately $3.6 billion.
Lieber principally provides investment advice and administrative services to the Evergreen funds, several large
institutional investors and a number of high net worth individuals. The First Union Notice details the functions
currently performed by Lieber for its clients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mellon has assets of approximately $28 billion. Both Mellon and its holding company, Mellon Bank Corporation (MBC),
which has assets of approximately $36 billion, already have substantial involvement in trust and investment activities,
including mutual fund administration, brokerage, master trust and custody, institutional investment management
and personal trust. MBC currently administers approximately $615 billion in assets and manages approximately $135
billion in assets. Dreyfus, the sixth-largest mutual fund company in the United States, provides investment advice
and administrative services to over 130 mutual funds with approximately $80 billion in assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Mellon Notice details the function of each of the existing Dreyfus corporations and subsidiaries and sets forth
which entities will be acquired as operating subsidiaries of Mellon, which will be acquired as operating subsidiaries
of MBC, and which will be sold or liquidated. Pursuant to Mellon's proposal, several of the Dreyfus entities will become
operating subsidiaries of Mellon. The Dreyfus operations currently include subsidiaries which provide investment
advisory, brokerage, and administrative services to registered investment companies which are known to the public
as the Dreyfus family of mutual funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCC invites public comment on the First Union and Mellon Notices in order to provide interested parties with an
opportunity to express their views concerning the proposed acquisitions that may assist the OCC in making a final
determination concerning the First Union and Mellon Notices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The First Union and Mellon Notices and any public comments submitted are available for inspection by appointment
at the OCC headquarters in Washington, DC. Appointments may be made by calling the Disclosure Unit at the telephone

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The weekly FC&hyph;1 and monthly FC&hyph;2 reports must be filed throughout the calendar year by each foreign exchange
market participant which had more than $50 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business
day of any calendar quarter during the previous year (ending March, June, September, or December) calculated using

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
By this Notice the Department of the Treasury is informing the public that it is conducting a mandatory survey of United
States residents' ownership and/or custody of selected financial claims on foreigners other than long-term debt
or equity securities. The purpose of this survey is to reassess the value of various classes of portfolio capital positions
on foreigners as currently reported by United States persons under the Treasury International Capitol reporting
system. The data will be used to ensure the quality and completeness of international financial statistics which
are vital components used in determining the international investment position and in compiling the official balance
of payments accounts of the United States. These data are also important in the formulation of the U.S. Government's
international financial and monetary policies. The survey has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget
pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act under OMB Control No. 1505&hyph;0150.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This survey has been designed to collect systematic and consistent information on selected classes of financial
claims on foreigners owned by U.S. persons as of March 31, 1994, while holding the reporting requirements to a minimum.
The survey's approach is to collect data from global custodians located in the United States to the extent possible.
Data are requested only by type of instrument. Data are not required on individual claims and financial instruments,
nor on the geographical distribution of such assets. The survey collects data on certain types of claims on foreigners
owned by U.S. persons that represent portfolio investment. Reportable claims include deposits with foreign institutions,
financial instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, and loans to foreigners. Excluded are direct
investments, equity holdings, debt securities with an original maturity of more than one year, contingent claims,
and off-balance sheet contracts, including unsettled spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, options, and
warrants. More detailed information on the categories of claims and financial instruments to report is provided
in the survey form and instructions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Notice constitutes legal notification to all United States persons that they must respond to, and comply with,
this survey if they are subject to the reporting requirements set forth below in Who Must Report. United States persons
who are required to report but who do not receive a set of the ``Survey of Selected Foreign Financial Assets ``forms
and instructions, should obtain copies by contacting the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at (212) 720&hyph;8238,
or the Department of the Treasury at (202) 622&hyph;2250.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Citizen Exchanges (E/P) of the United States Information Agency proposes a two-way exchange program
for Brazilian decision-makers to develop strategies to address human resource management problems in Brazil. This
exchange will involve two components: a two-week U.S. study tour by a delegation of 12&hyph;16 Brazilian leaders
selected from the national government, the national employers organizations, and labor unions; and a follow-on
visit to Brazil by U.S. human resource management experts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These study tours will explore methods of human resource development based on private sector initiative that involve
the cooperation of labor, management, and government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the U.S. Departments of Labor and Education support such models as solutions to resolve labor-management
conflict. In Brazil, coordination will be with the Ministry of Labor's Secretary For Training and Professional Development,
the national employer's organizations, and the Labor Central.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other goals of this program are to aid in modernizing Brazil's economy, ensure the growth of its democratic institutions,
and increase public awareness of the vital policy-making role that labor can play in the general well-being of a dynamic
society.

Program Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Structural unemployment, technological change, and the pressure of global competition, combined with a poorly
educated work force, have magnified Brazil's lack of a coherent approach to human resource development. Currently,
the formation of human capital is financed by payroll taxes and run by the business community, ostensibly with government
approval. However, there is no manpower development strategy in Brazil that involves all parties: labor, management,
and the government. With Brazil's ever-increasing levels of unemployment and social unrest the optimum use of labor
is essential in modernizing the country's economy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Labor-management human resource development in the U.S. telecommunications, automobile, construction and steel
industries provides practical models for the situation in Brazil. The following case studies are suggested as sources:
The AT&amp;T/CWA Alliance project; the pioneering work of the UAW and the automobile industry; and the entry level
programs of the construction industry in tandem with the building trades organizations of the AFL&hyph;CIO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The research of former Labor Secretary Ray Marshall and Dr. Barry Bluestone could also be consulted, in addition to
more recent efforts by U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich. Other sources include labor studies centers such as those
at George Washington University and the University of the District of Columbia; the AIFLD education program at the
George Meany Center for Labor Studies; the AFL&hyph;CIO's Human Resource Institute; the National Association of
Manufacturers; and the Conference Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Models used to illustrate effective labor-management-government relations must include those involving currently-employed
individuals, the chronically unemployed, and new entrants into the labor pool.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decisive and expanding role of labor-management cooperation should be emphasized as a key element in meeting
the competitive challenges of the global economy. The program should also emphasize the coordination between human
resource development delivery methods and the constant change that occurs in business and industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Selection of Participants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants must be policymakers who can influence changes in Brazil, not management experts and professionals.
Participants will be selected by the grantee, or its local co-sponsoring organization, in consultation with USIS
posts. This two-way support will ensure effective discussion of new models for cooperation and innovation; these
models should encourage more participation between labor and management, supporting Brazil's effort to secure
more private sector initiative resulting in a more competitive market economy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This project will be executed by a U.S. not-for-profit institution that, through its proposal, illustrates extensive
experience and success in coordinating international exchange programs. U.S. organizations with established
working relationships with counterpart institutions in Brazil will receive priority under this competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the conclusion of the exchange, the grantee will conduct participant evaluations and submit a final report to USIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Competition for USIA funding support is intense. Selection of a grantee institution is based on the substantive nature
of the program proposal; the applicant's professional capability to carry the program through to successful conclusion;
the cost effectiveness such as in-kind contributions and the ability to keep overhead costs at a minimum. USIA can
devote up to $175,000 for this project; however, organizations with fewer than four years of successful experience
in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000, and their budget submission should correspond
to this limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All proposals should demonstrate in-depth, substantive knowledge of the relevant issues, established connections
with partner institutions, and the capacity to organize and conduct the program. Organizational abilities include:
appropriate orientation activities for the participants; detailed work plan for all phases of the project; tentative
agendas for study tours, workshops, and internships; letters of commitment from internship hosts; and selection
procedures.

USIA will give priority to proposals from U.S. organizations with partner organizations in the American Republics
that can help ensure the program meets its goals and objectives. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate partner
relationships by providing copies of correspondence or other materials as appendices to proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, these partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing or significant in-kind contributions
such as local housing, transportation, interpreting, translating and other local currency costs and to assist with
the organization of projects.

Materials Development
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USIA encourages the development, where needed, of written, audio and video materials in the local language to enhance
the programs. For example, if not already available, glossaries of specialized terms in local government or public
administration might be developed.

Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals should limit their focus to local governance. Proposals for programs that are broader in scope will be eligible,
but are less likely to receive USIA support. USIA encourages proposals that feature ``train the trainers'' models;
the creation of indigenous training centers; schemes to create professional networks or professional associations
to disseminate information; and other enduring aspects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Participant Selection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All grant proposals must clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process
by which participants will be selected. Programs in support of internships in the U.S. must include letters tentatively
committing host institutions to support the internships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the selection of all foreign participants, USIA and USIS Posts retain the right to nominate participants and to
accept or deny participants recommended by the program institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they may also include separate sub-budgets
for each program component, phase, location, or activity. Competition for USIA funding support is keen.

Interpreters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Interpreters for the U.S. program are provided by the U.S. State Department Language Services Division. Generally,
two simultaneous interpreters are provided for every four visitors who need interpretation. USIA grants do not pay
for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations from their home country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant proposal budgets should contain a flat $140/day per diem for each Department of State (DOS) interpreter, as
well as home-program-home air transportation of $400 per interpreter plus any U.S. travel expenses during the program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This project will encourage Africans to support conflict resolution within the region as an activity in the common
interest of all, fostering stability and economic development in the region as a whole. The project should help strengthen
relevant regional organizational capabilities, and the grantee is expected to work closely with an Africa-based
multilateral organization interested in conflict resolution for this purpose. Together with that body and area
U.S. Information Service (USIS) posts, the grantee will identify key government, military and NGO leaders to participate
in the exchanges; these participants should represent several African countries as well as the regional organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project will include at least two phases: (1) A U.S. phase designed to introduce African participants to American
specialists and approaches to local and international conflict resolution and (2) one or more visits of American
specialists to Africa to conduct consultations, workshops or other activities with local counterparts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As Israelis and Palestinians work toward implementing the declaration of principles, the U.S. Mission in Israel
is encouraging greater cooperation among Israeli-Arabs and Jews. This project will contribute to the overall peace
process and resolution of conflict between the two ethnic groups by encouraging interaction and advancing successful
Arab integration into Israeli society. Bringing mayors and municipal officials from both sides together with American
counterparts, the program will enhance leadership skills, including the skills of negotiation and conflict resolution,
and emphasize the economic and social benefits of increased intermunicipal cooperation.

Arbitration: Building Dispute Resolution Mechanisms in Palestinian Society
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
USIA will accept proposals designed to support the development of a two-way exchange program to assist Palestinian
lawyers and legal institutions in establishing internationally credible dispute and conflict resolution mechanisms
in the fields of commerce, labor, and civil matters. The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $125,000. For
technical information, interested organizations may contact E/P Program Specialist Charlotte Peterson at (202)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Background/Objectives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Palestinian society has traditionally depended on a dispute arbitration mechanism centered on prominent figures,
such as clan or village leaders, to mediate and resolve commercial, social, and family disputes. While other Middle
Eastern societies have moved beyond this traditional process of mediation_at least for resolution of commercial
and legal disputes_Palestinians have, in the absence of a rational legal structure in the occupied territories,
continued to rely almost exclusively on this informal, consensual process. As the peace process evolves toward Palestinian
autonomy, it has become critical that Palestinians adopt internationally credible models of dispute resolution
as a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sine qua non 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for attracting the international investment essential to bolster Palestinian autonomy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project should be designed to:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Familiarize Palestinian legal experts_many of whom are now working on the general outlines of a constitution and
legal framework to govern the autonomous regions_with the types of arbitration organizations and mechanisms Americans
rely on to resolve commercial, labor, and other disputes. This introduction should be squarely placed within a framework
of the judicial system in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Promote cooperation between Palestinian and American experts in formulating and proposing specific dispute resolution
mechanisms for the Palestinian autonomous regions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Provide, as a third exchange component, internships with an American arbitration group for a small group of Palestinians
closely involved with the evolution of dispute resolution mechanisms within the autonomous authority, so that they
might learn how arbitration mechanisms actually work in American society.

Recommended Structural/Procedural Objectives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_A visit to the United States, to take place as early as possible, for six to eight Palestinian legal experts to become
familiar with arbitration organizations and conflict resolution mechanisms. A three-week program, with visits
to at least three cities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Travel of three or four American legal experts involved in the first component of the exchange, to take place after
a lapse of several months, to work for four to six weeks in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza with legal experts on formulating
dispute resolution mechanisms for the Palestinian autonomous regions.

Background for Nicaragua
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nicaraguans historically have found it hard to resolve their own conflicts. They have often tried to enlist outsiders,
frequently from the U.S., as partisans in their disputes, or turned to them for mediation and arbitration when all
else has failed. This dynamic has been a source of instability for over 150 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some Nicaraguans recognize this failing and are trying to remedy it. In the past year, two university-linked research
institutes have been formed to study conflict resolution. A local environmental group sponsored a workshop organized
by professional U.S. mediators on resolving environmental disputes, hosted by the new binational center. Still,
if Nicaraguans are to complete this process successfully, they need training and support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. policy today is to encourage Nicaraguans to resolve their internal conflicts without looking to the U.S. for
assistance and/or intervention. With this in mind, the Post proposes a project to strengthen Nicaraguan conflict
resolution. USIA will work with the grantee and local organizations to identify a bipartisan (the only conceivable
approach) pool of trainees who could conduct conflict resolution training for other Nicaraguans and provide mediation
services and related activities (fact-finding, curriculum development, etc.). This program would respond to a
historic need in Nicaragua.

Background for Guatemala
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Guatemala's 33 year-old civil war has cost more than 100,000 lives, has severely hindered democratic and social development
in the country, and has adversely affected the fortunes of every government of Guatemala since the war's inception.
Although heated constitutional and political battles dominate daily headlines, this conflict continues to cast
a long shadow over the country's future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Media co-sponsorship would be desirable, such as by the centrist daily Siglo XXI and its publisher, Jorge Reuben Zamora;
the issues-oriented talk show ``Libre Encuentro'' and its host, Dionisio Gutierrez; and Guatemala's newest daily,
La Republica, which, though it probably has the smallest readership, is well-written and tightly edited, and is supported
by the media family, Marroquin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Post envisions meetings and workshops at a neutral site, such as Miami, which is both easily accessible to Guatemalans
and equipped with the resources necessary to support such a program. A site such as Miami, which is also home base to
many CentAm beat reporters, would likely generate considerable regional coverage and encourage the participation
of key participants such as Rigoberta Menchu and Frank LaRue, as well as younger members of the URNG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program must focus on specific issues (i.e. refugee resettlement, land tenure, political participation by the
URNG), and be managed by professionals. Innovation is absolutely necessary to avoid the dry and meaningless ``round
tables'' and seminars that are so common in Guatemala itself.

U.S. foreign policy in Asia is receptive to the concept of regional security consultations. The ASEAN&hyph;U.S.

Russia has been invited to participate in ARF, along with China, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea. The USG has also
welcomed the holding of symposia sponsored by the private sector on Northeast Asia security.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants are encouraged to view these security dialogues as conflict resolution arrangements where potential
adversaries talk to each other rather than form blocs against a common adversary. Proposals should present ideas
as to how to extend the dialogue to encompass the entire East Asia and Pacific region or how to enhance the evolving subregional
dialogues (e.g. ASEAN, North Asia). Proposals should treat conflict resolution as preventive diplomacy, including
reducing tensions, building confidence, and deterring arms races in addition to contributing to the solution of
specific conflicts or potential specific conflicts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security (and thus, conflict resolution) may be broadly defined to include regional issues that directly or indirectly
contribute to security (or the lack thereof), such as economic growth and other conditions affecting trade and social
stability, including environmental and energy issues, and population questions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conflict resolution project focussed on Northeast Asia should account for private as well as public sector interests,
and should be aimed toward stimulating participants' appreciation of the benefits to the East Asia and Pacific community
as a whole to be derived from discussions of both the opportunities for cooperation and the potential conflicts in
the subregion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

USIA is interested in supporting programs which will lay the groundwork for new and continuing links between American
and foreign professional organizations and non-governmental organizations in the area of conflict resolution
and in the specific fields mentioned in the above project descriptions. Proposals which are overly ambitious and
those which are very general will not be competitive. Therefore, institutions should provide strong evidence of
their ability to accomplish a few tasks exceptionally well. General structural or procedural objectives for all
of the above projects include the following:

Bureau grants are not given to support projects whose focus is limited to technical issues, or for research projects,
developing publications for dissemination in the United States, individual student exchange, film festivals,
or exhibits. Neither does the Office of Citizen Exchanges provide scholarships or support for long-term (a semester
or more) academic studies. Competitions sponsored by other Bureau offices are also announced in the

All grant proposals should clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process
by which participants will be selected. However, USIA and USIS posts retain the right to nominate all foreign participants
and to accept or deny participants recommended by grantee institutions. Grantee institutions will often provide
support, as requested by USIA, in the nomination of participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grantee should provide the names of American participants and brief, relevant biographical data. American participants
should be selected on the basis of their experience and expertise in the thematic field. Relevant language ability,
experience in communicating to foreign audiences and general knowledge of the regions and countries involved in
the respective projects are highly desirable.

Programmatic Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the legislation authorizing the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, programs must maintain
a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social
and cultural life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA will give priority to proposals from U.S. organizations with relevant institutional contacts in the countries
involved in the various projects described above. Partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing
or significant in-kind contributions such as local housing and transportation, interpreting, translating and
other local currency costs. These institutions are also encouraged to assist with the organization of various program
activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grantee will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include selecting speakers,
themes, and topics for discussion; organizing a coherent progression of activities; providing international and
domestic travel arrangements for all foreign participants and U.S. domestic travel for escort-interpreters; making
lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors; orienting and debriefing participants; preparing
any necessary support materials; and working with host institutions and individuals to achieve maximum program
effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the start of the U.S. portion of a program, the grantee should conduct an orientation session for the visiting delegation
which addresses substantive details of the program as well as geographic, historical, and cross-cultural factors
which they should consider to enhance program success.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon conclusion of the program the grantee will be required to submit a report to E/P summarizing results of the entire
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Program monitoring and oversight will be provided by appropriate USIA elements. Per Diem support from host institutions
during an internship component is strongly encouraged. However, for all programs which include internships, a nonprofit
grantee institution which receives funds from corporate or other cosponsors should then use those monies to provide
food, lodging, and pocket money for the participants. In no case could the intern receive a wage or ``be hired'' by the
sponsoring institution. Internships should also have an American studies/values orientation component at the
beginning of the exchange program in the U.S. Grantee institutions should try to maximize cost-sharing in all facets
of their program design, and to stimulate U.S. private sector (foundation and corporate) support.

Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Organizations with less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are
limited to $60,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Competition for USIA funding support is keen. The final selection of a grantee institution will depend on assessment
of proposals according to the review criteria delineated below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While applicants must provide on all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they are also encouraged to include separate
sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location or activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: (1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular
No. A&hyph;133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions; (2) complies with
the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No.
92&hyph;9; and (3) includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental
schedule of indirect cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The audit costs shall be identified separately for: (1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting
services; and (2) preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133,
AICPA SOP 92&hyph;9, and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USIA will consider funding the following project costs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs (e.g., airport taxes); ground transportation costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Per diem: For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for international participants
or the published Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates for individual American cities. NOTE: U.S. escorting
staff must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities overseas, the Standard Government
Travel Regulations per diem rates must be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Interpreters: For the U.S. program interpreters are provided by the U.S. State Department Language Services Division.
Typically, a pair of simultaneous interpreters is provided for every four visitors who need interpretation. USIA
grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations from their home country. Grant proposal budgets
should contain a flat $140/day per diem for each DOS interpreter, as well as home-program-home air transportation
of $400 per interpreter plus any U.S. travel expenses during the program. Salary expenses are covered centrally and
should not be part of an applicant's proposed budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Book and cultural allowance: Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus
a book allowance of $50. Escorts are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these
benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Consultants: May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Honoraria generally do not
exceed $250 per day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written contract(s) must be
included in the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Room rental: Generally should not exceed $250 per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Materials Development: Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop and translate materials for participants.
USIA reserves the rights to these materials for future use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. One working meal per project: Per capita cost may not exceed $5&hyph;8 per lunch and $14&hyph;20 per dinner, excluding
room rental. The number of invited guests may not exceed the number of participants by more than a factor of two to one.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Return travel allowance: $70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred during
international travel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Other costs necessary for the effective administration of the program, including salaries for grant organization
employees, benefits, and other direct and indirect costs per detailed instructions in the application package.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E/P encourages cost-sharing, which may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient must maintain
written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing
and Matching,'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not meet the minimum amount
of cost-sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion
to the Recipient's contribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please note: All delegates will be covered under the terms of a USIA/sponsored health insurance policy. The premium
is paid by USIA directly to the insurance company.

Application Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals must be structured in accordance with the instructions contained in the Application Package. Confirmation
letters from U.S. and foreign co-sponsors noting their intention to participate in the program will enhance a proposal.

Review Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the Application Package.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. All eligible proposals will
be reviewed by the appropriate geographic area offices and the budget and contract offices. Proposals may also be
reviewed by the Office of General Counsel or other Agency offices. Funding decisions are at the discretion of the Associate
Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for grant awards resides with USIA's contracting
officer. The award of any grant is subject to availability of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject any or all applications received. USIA will not pay for design and
development costs associated with submitting a proposal. Applications are submitted at the risk of the applicant;
should circumstances prevent award of a grant, all preparation and submission costs are at the applicant's expense.
USIA will not award funds for activities conducted prior to the actual grant award.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Citizen Exchanges (E/P) of the United States Information Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural
Affairs announces a competitive grants program for nonprofit organizations to develop multi-phased exchange programs
for journalism educators. There will be two separate exchange programs, and American organizations are invited
to submit proposals for one or both. One program will be for 10 to 12 educators from the Middle East and North Africa;
the other program will be for 10 to 12 educators from South Asia. The journalism educators will come to the United States
for an intensive, six-week study program in American journalism education, with emphasis on curriculum development,
the relationship of education to the practice of journalism, the development of professionalism in journalism,
and an introduction to American print media, from student publications at the university and secondary school levels
to substantive contact with newspapers. During the second phase of each exchange program, two teams of two American
journalism educators will travel to selected countries for consultations with phase one participants and their
colleagues. Each team will visit two or three countries and will focus on curriculum development and the establishment
of student publications as an educational device. These target countries will be selected through consultations
among USIA, USIS posts and the program organizer after completion of the first program component.

Background/Objectives of This Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The end of colonialism and the consequent dramatic rise in the number of sovereign states in the developing world have
produced an equally dramatic rise in the scope and diversity of available news media, both print and broadcast. However,
much of the reporting disseminated through these media is flawed by the absence of journalistic skills, appropriate
educational background, and appreciation for professional standards among those employed as journalists. In addition,
media throughout the Near East, North Africa, and South Asia are often utilized to mold public opinion, rather than
to provide objective information, and to rally support for the policies of parties holding or seeking power, rather
than to present an independent, credible account or a responsible analysis of social and political phenomena.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary objective of this program is to further the development of journalism education as an independent academic
discipline in North Africa, the Near East, and South Asia, and thereby to strengthen substantive, responsible, and
objective media reporting, reflecting international recognized standards of journalistic professionalism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project proposals should focus on the cultivation of a cadre of journalism educators_both professors and deans of
schools of journalism_from the Near East and North Africa, or from South Asia, who are persuaded of the need for curricular
reform and development in order to train well educated, responsible journalists and who are able and willing to translate
their convictions into efforts to bring about such reform and development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Journalism educators from the Middle East and North Africa who will participate in the U.S. phase of this program will
be provided the service of bilingual escort-interpreters in Arabic, with one interpreter for each five/six participants
and one language-fluent escort for the group (to be facilitated by USIA through the U.S. Department of State). For
American consultants participating in the second component of the Near East/North African exchange, fluency in
Arabic or French, depending on the countries visited and the language preference of the anticipated audiences, would
be desirable. In the absence of language fluency, arrangements should be made by the grantee organization, in consultation
with USIS posts, for interpretation. Participating educators in the South Asian exchange must possess strong English
language skills. American consultants traveling to South Asia during the second component of the program may require
the service of interpreters, depending upon the language facility of the South Asian educators with whom they will
work in the region. Again, the grantee organization should coordinate arrangements for in-country interpreters
with the appropriate USIS posts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants will be nominated through coordination among USIA, U.S. Information Service personal in the region,
and overseas partner institutions. USIA and the participating USIS posts retain the right to nominate all participants
and to accept or reject participants recommended by grantee institutions. The U.S. consultants who will travel abroad
will be selected by the grantee institution in consultation with USIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIS officers in participating countries will facilitate the issuance of visas and other program-related material.

Programmatic Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thematically, each program should:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Analyze the current status of professional journalism and journalism education in the participants' countries
of origin and determine, in conjunction with USIS posts in these countries and with the journalism educators selected
as participants, the needs to be addressed by the exchange;

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Provide the participants both a general and a specific overview of journalism education and the practice of journalism
in the United States, beginning with an historic perspective and a survey of the evolution of the public media in the
context of a socially diverse and politically democratic country;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Conduct for the participants short, intensive, lecture-seminary-discussion courses in journalism education,
focussing primarily on curriculum development, the structuring of apprenticeships or internships as an integral
component of the journalist's training, and the development of student publications as essential to journalism
education.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_And arrange one-week, intensive, participant/observer placements for the journalism educators as a group in the
journalism departments of three universities, preferably reflecting diversity of size, orientation, and geographic
location. These placements should include, in each case, classroom observation, first-hand experience in producing
a student publication, visits to at least one medium-to-large newspaper which features both national and international
reporting, and, if possible, observation of high-school level student journalism classes and publications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the legislation authorizing the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, programs must maintain
a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social
and cultural life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beyond the immediate goals of this exchange, USIA is also interested in supporting programs which will lay the groundwork
for new and continuing links between American and Middle Eastern, North African, and South Asian educational institutions
and professional organizations and which will encourage the further growth and development of democratic institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grantee organization will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include
organizing a coherent progression of activities, providing international and domestic travel arrangements for
all participants, making lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors, orienting and debriefing
participants, preparing any necessary support material, and working with host institutions and individuals to
achieve maximum program effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prepare foreign journalism educators for this project prior to their arrival in the United States, E/P encourages
the grantee organization to develop material that would be sent to USIS offices overseas for distribution to participants.
This material might include a tentative project outline with suggested goals and objectives, relevant background
information, and information about American institutions and individuals involved in the exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the beginning of the program, the grantee organization should conduct an orientation session for the visiting
participants which addresses administrative details of the program and provides general information about American
society and culture which will facilitate the participants' understanding of and adjustment to daily life in the
United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the conclusion of the program, the group should meet in a one-day evaluation and planning session to review what
has been presented to and experienced by the participants and to consider how that which has been learned can most effectively
be applied upon the participants' return to their home countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Program monitoring and oversight will be provided by appropriate USIA elements. The U.S. grantee institution should
try to maximize cost-sharing in all facets of the program and to stimulate U.S. private sector (foundation and corporate)
support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals incorporating participant/observer site visits will be more competitive if letters committing prospective
host institutions to support these efforts are provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Competition for USIA funding support is keen. The final selection of a grantee institution will depend on assessment
of proposals according to a the review criteria delineated below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $165,000 for each of these programs. However, organizations with
less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they are also encouraged to include separate
sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location or activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position
(SOP) No. 92&hyph;9; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect
cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The audit costs shall be identified separately for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting services; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133, AICPA SOP 92&hyph;9,
and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA will consider funding the following project costs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs (e.g., airport taxes); ground transportation costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Per diem: For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat rate of $140/day for international
participants or the published Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates for individual American cities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 U.S. escorting staff must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities in the Middle
East, North Africa and South Asia, the Standard Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates must be used.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Escort-interpreters: Interpretation for U.S.-based programs is provided by the State Department's Language
Services Division. USIA grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations during travel to or from
their home country. Grant proposal budgets should contain a flat $140/day per diem rate for each State Department
interpreter, as well as home-program-home air transportation of $400 per interpreter and any U.S. travel expenses
during the program itself. Salary expenses are covered centrally and are not part of the applicant's budget proposal.
For the second component of the program, a limited amount of grant funds would be available for interpreters, should
interpretation be required. The grant applicant is encouraged to confirm with the appropriate USIS posts the local
costs for interpreters. Grant proposals should reflect these costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Book and cultural allowance: Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus
a book allowance of $50. Escorts are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these
benefits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Consultants: May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Honoraria should not exceed
$250 per day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written contract(s) must be included
in the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Room rental: generally should not exceed $250 per day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Materials: Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop and translate materials for participants. USIA reserves
the rights to these materials for future use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. One working meal per project: Per capita cost may not exceed $5&hyph;8 per lunch and $14&hyph;20 per dinner, excluding
room rental. The number of invited guests may not exceed the number of participants by a factor of more than two to one.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Return travel allowance: $70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred during
international travel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Other costs necessary for the effective administration of the program, including salaries for grant organization
employees, benefits, and other direct and indirect costs per detailed instructions in the application package.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E/P encourages cost-sharing, which may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient must maintain
written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing
and Matching,'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not meet the minimum amount
of cost-sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution.

The meetings are a follow-up to similar meetings conducted by the BIA since 1990. The purpose of the consultation,
as required by 25 U.S.C. 2010(b), is to provide Indian tribes, school boards, parents, Indian organizations and other
interested parties with an opportunity to comment on potential issues raised during previous consultation meetings
or being considered by the BIA regarding Indian education programs. A consultation booklet for the March meetings
is being distributed to Federally recognized Indian Tribes, Bureau Area and Agency Offices and Bureau-funded schools.
The booklets will also be available from local contact persons and at each meeting.
