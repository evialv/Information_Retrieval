SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 905 (7 CFR part 905) regulating the handling
of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order
is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674), hereinafter
referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 100 Florida citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges, grapefruit,
tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and about 11,000 producers of these citrus fruits in Florida. Small agricultural
producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts
of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than
$3,500,000. A minority of these handlers and a majority of the producers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Citrus Administrative Committee (committee) met November 16, 1993, and unanimously recommended this action.
The committee meets prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis
for citrus fruit regulated under the order. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may
express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well
as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules
and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 905.140 (7 CFR 905.140) provides the terms and conditions under which handlers can ship fruit in gift packages
exempt from handling regulations in effect under &sect;&sect;905.52 and 905.53 of the order. Certain gift fruit
packages are exempted from such regulations, since they contain fruit of mixed varieties and non-fruit items, and
thus, would not meet the grade and size requirements of the handling regulations. Prior to the effective date of the
interim rule (58 FR 65538, December 15, 1993), handlers could only ship one or two gift packages per day exempt from
such regulations, depending on the circumstances, to individuals and distributors. The interim final rule increased
the number of gift packages of fruit which handlers can ship under this exemption provision, enabling handlers to
ship an unlimited number of packages of gift fruit to individuals and distributors, provided certain safeguards
are met by the handler of the fruit. These safeguards specify that each gift package must be individually addressed
to the person using the fruit, and that gift packages shipped to any gift fruit distributor must either be individually
addressed or marked ``not for resale''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule was effective on December 9, 1993, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 65538, December 15, 1993). The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending January 14, 1994,
and no comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to relax the exemption provisions
for gift fruit shipments as specified. Such relaxation will enable handlers to ship more packages of gift fruit to
meet consumer needs, exempt from grade and size requirements issued under the order. This action is in the interest
of producers, handlers, distributors, and consumers, and is expected to increase returns to Florida citrus fruit
growers. The Department's view is that this action will have a beneficial impact on Florida citrus fruit producers
and handlers, since it will permit the industry to make additional gift fruit available to meet consumer needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee,
and other information, it is found that the relaxation as set forth below will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule changing reporting requirements prescribed under the California-Arizona navel and Valencia orange
marketing orders. The marketing orders regulate the handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated
parts of California and are administered locally by the Navel and Valencia Orange Administrative Committees (committees).
This rule suspends language in the orders and in the orders' rules and regulations to discontinue the use of Form 8 (Certificate
of Assignment of Allotment) and Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment). These changes reduce
the burden of information collection requirements currently provided for under the marketing orders.

There are approximately 140 handlers of navel oranges and 125 handlers of Valencia oranges who are subject to regulation
under the respective marketing order and approximately 3,750 producers of navel oranges and 3,700 producers of Valencia
oranges in the regulated areas. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration
(13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural producers are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California-Arizona
navel and Valencia oranges may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule finalizes two changes in the reporting requirements prescribed under the California-Arizona orange marketing
orders. This rule suspends language in the orders and in the orders' rules and regulations to discontinue the use of
Form 8 (Certificate of Assignment of Allotment) and Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment).
These changes were unanimously recommended by the committees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An interim final rule on this issue was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 1268, January 10, 1994), with an effective date of January 10, 1994. That rule suspended &sect;&sect;907.58,
907.71, 908.58, and 908.71 of the orders, and &sect;&sect;907.112, 907.141, 908.112, and 908.141 of the rules and
regulations in effect under the orders. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended February 9, 1994. No
comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 907.58 and 908.58 of the navel and Valencia orange marketing orders specify that, for the handling of oranges
other than by rail car (primarily truck shipments), handlers issue to the consignee an assignment of allotment certificate
covering each quantity of oranges so handled. Sections 907.112 and 908.112 of the orders' rules and regulations require
handlers to submit such information on Form 8. Handlers are also required to segregate the information on Form 8 by
size of oranges shipped and destination (i.e., U.S. and Alaska or Canada). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the inception of the orders, the committees have utilized Form 8 primarily for tracking and verifying truck
shipments of oranges that were subject to volume regulation. However, with the volume regulation features of the
orders suspended (58 FR 53,114; October 14, 1993), the committees believe that continued submission of Form 8 creates
an additional burden on handlers that is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the committees, many handlers have long questioned the value of Form 8 (commonly referred to in the industry
as ``the daily truck ticket'') during periods of no volume regulation. Shipment information from Form 8 is transferred
to Form 4 (Weekly Report). Handlers maintain their own manifest records of these shipments and, without weekly volume
regulation, Form 4 provides similar data with the exception of number of cartons shipped by size. The committees plan
on requesting size information from handlers as needed on a voluntary basis and anticipate revising the weekly Form
4 at a later time to provide for the collection of size information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 8, particularly during periods of no volume regulation,
is not necessary. Accordingly, the committees have recommended suspending &sect;&sect;907.58 and 908.58 of the
orders and &sect;&sect;907.112 and 908.112 of the orders' rules and regulations so that Form 8 will be discontinued.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The second change that the committees recommended concerns Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment).
Currently, &sect;&sect;907.71 and 908.71 of the orange orders provide that handlers furnish to the committees information
regarding cartons of oranges handled, segregated by size, within 24 hours of shipment. Handlers must also indicate
whether the shipments were destined to points in the U.S. and Alaska or Canada. Sections 907.141 and 908.141 of the
orders' rules and regulations require handlers to submit this information for rail car shipments on Form 3.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collected on Form 3 is similar to the information collected on Form 8 described earlier, but pertains
to rail car shipments rather than truck shipments. Again, this information has historically been utilized primarily
for tracking and verifying shipments of oranges that were subject to volume regulation. However, with the volume
regulation features of the orders suspended, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 3, like Form
8, creates an additional burden on handlers that is unnecessary. Handlers are also required to submit similar information
on rail car shipments on the weekly Form 4. As with size information pertaining to truck shipments, the committees
plan on requesting size information from handlers for rail car shipments on a voluntary basis until the weekly Form
4 is appropriately revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like Form 8, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 3, particularly during periods of no volume
regulation, is not necessary. Accordingly, the committees have recommended suspending &sect;&sect;907.71 and
908.71 of the orders and &sect;&sect;907.141 and 908.141 of the orders' rules and regulations so that Form 3 will be
discontinued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB numbers
0581&hyph;0116 for navel oranges and 0581&hyph;0121 for Valencia oranges. This rule reduces the reporting burden
on approximately 265 handlers of navel and Valencia oranges who have been completing Form 8, taking about .40 hour
to complete each report. This rule also reduces the reporting burden on about 80 orange handlers who ship by rail at
some point during a season and utilize Form 3, taking about 0.20 hours to complete each report.

After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees,

 This rule suspends all the provisions applicable to pears and certain nomination provisions under Federal Marketing
Order (M.O.) No. 917. This rule also directs that a referendum be conducted among eligible pear producers in California
to determine whether they favor continuance of the pear provisions under M.O. 917. This suspension is being implemented
because the California Bartlett pear industry is now using a California State pear program, and is no longer using
the pear provisions under M.O. 917.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

This rule is issued under the provisions of section 8c(16)(A) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937,
as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act; and of &sect;917.42 (b) of Marketing Order
No. 917 (7 CFR Part 917) regulating the handling of fresh pears and peaches grown in California, hereinafter referred
to as the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The order authorizes minimum grade, maturity, quality, and size requirements; container size, pack, and marking
requirements; and reporting and special purpose shipment requirements. The order also provides for the establishment
of production and marketing research, market development, and paid advertising. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The referendum will be conducted in accordance with the procedure for the conduct of referenda to determine whether
continuation of the order's pear provisions is favored by producers, who during the representative period were engaged,
in the State of California, in the production of pears covered by the order. The procedure applicable to the referenda
is the ``Procedure for the Conduct of Referenda in Connection with Marketing Orders for Fruits, Vegetables, and Nuts
Pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as Amended'' (7 CFR Part 900.400 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The representative production period for the conduct of such referendum is hereby determined to be June 1, 1994,
through November 30, 1994. The referendum will be conducted within the period beginning December 1, 1994, and ending

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 15, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 45 California pear handlers subject to regulation under the order, and about 300 producers of pears
in the production area. Small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than
$3,500,000, and small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified
as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule indefinitely suspends all of the pear provisions in the order, along with the rules and regulations issued
thereunder, including: (1) Provisions pertaining to the administration of the order, including committee nominations
and selections; (2) the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container, and inspection requirements;
(3) the issuance of administrative rules and regulations related to exemptions and special purpose shipments; and
(4) information collection and reporting requirements. The pear provisions being suspended are in &sect;&sect;917.4,
917.15, 917.20, 917.21, 917.24, 917.25, 917.26, 917.28, 917.29, 917.34, and 917.35 of the order; and in &sect;&sect;917.100,
917.121, 917.143, 917.149, 917.176, 917.179, and 917.461 of the rules and regulations issued thereunder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also suspends certain provisions in &sect;917.18 pertaining to nomination of Control Committee members,
to enable the Control Committee to continue to function with only peach members upon suspension of the order's pear
provisions. Since the pear provisions are being suspended, there is no need for the pear industry members to serve
on the Control Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pear Commodity Committee (committee) unanimously recommended suspension of most of the pear provisions under
the order, because such provisions are no longer needed. The California Bartlett pear industry is now functioning
under the California Pear Marketing Program (State pear program), and is no longer using the pear order provisions.
The State pear program, developed by the California Bartlett pear industry and the California Department of Food
and Agriculture, is similar to the Federal pear program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee recommended suspension, not termination, of the order's pear provisions to provide the California
Bartlett pear industry with an opportunity to review operations under the State pear program for an indefinite period
of time. The committee wants to maintain the option of reactivating the Federal pear program, if the State pear program
does not operate satisfactorily. The California pear industry will have the opportunity to examine the effectiveness
of the State pear program until the end of the 1994 marketing season. At that time, the Department will conduct a referendum
of eligible pear producers to determine whether they favor continuance of the Federal pear program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) has the authority to conduct a continuance referendum to determine whether
producers affected by a marketing order favor continuance of their order. The Secretary has determined that continuance
referenda are an effective means for ascertaining whether producers favor continuance of marketing order programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary would consider termination of the order's pear provisions if less than two-thirds of the pear producers
voting in the referendum and producers of less than two-thirds of the volume of pears represented in the referendum,
favor continuance. In evaluating the merits of continuance versus termination, the Secretary would consider the
results of the continuance referendum, other relevant information concerning the operation of the order's pear
provisions, and the relative benefits and disadvantages to producers, handlers, and consumers. Through such analysis,
the Secretary would determine whether continued existence of the order's pear provisions would tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any event section 8c(16)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to terminate an order whenever the Secretary finds
that a majority of all producers favor termination, and that majority produced for market more than 50 percent of the
commodity covered by the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event the Secretary terminates the order's pear provisions, the Control Committee shall, for the purpose of
liquidating the affairs of the committee, continue as trustees of any and all the funds and property in its possession,
or under its control, including claims for any funds unpaid or property not delivered.

Upon termination, the said trustees shall (1) continue in such capacity until discharged by the Secretary; (2) from
time to time account for all receipts and disbursements and deliver all property on hand, together with all books and
records of the committee and of the trustees, to such persons as the Secretary may direct; and (3) upon the request of
the Secretary, execute such assignments or other instruments necessary or appropriate to vest in such person, full
title and right to all of the funds, property, and claims vested in the committee or the trustees pursuant hereto. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person to whom funds, property, or claims have been transferred or delivered, shall be subject to the same obligation
imposed upon the committee and upon the trustees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a statement of total claims and debts, any remaining funds held in the reserve account will be returned, on a pro
rata basis, to those pear handlers who paid assessments under the order during the 1991&hyph;92 fiscal period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby directed that a referendum be conducted in accordance with the procedure for the conduct of referenda
(7 CFR 900.400 et seq.) to determine whether continuance of the order's pear provisions regulating the handling of
pears is approved or favored by producers who during the representative period were engaged in the production of such
pears grown in California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The referendum agents of the Secretary to conduct the referendum are hereby designated as Kurt J. Kimmel and Terry
Vawter, California Marketing Field Office, USDA/AMS, 2202 Monterey St., suite 102&hyph;B, Fresno, California
93721; telephone: 209&hyph;487&hyph;5901. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ballots will be mailed to all pear producers of record. Ballots may also be obtained at County Extension Service Offices,
or by contacting the California Marketing Field Office. Copies of the order may also be obtained by contacting the
California Marketing Field Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), information and collection requirements
for pears under the order have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB Control No.
0581&hyph;0080). The ballot material to be used in the referendum herein ordered has been submitted to and approved
by OMB, and it has been estimated that it will take an average of 30 minutes to read and complete the ballot for each of
the approximately 300 producers who elect to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the committee's recommendations, and other
available information, it is found and determined that the pear provisions in the order and the rules and regulations
issued thereunder, along with certain provisions in &sect;917.18 pertaining to the nomination of members to the
Control Committee, do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act at this time, and that such provisions should
be suspended. It is further found that suspending all the rules and regulations pertaining to pears issued under the
order will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document suspends, for 23 months, the 45 percent delivery requirement for a plant operated by a cooperative association
that is located within the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area. The suspension was requested by Gulf Dairy Association,
Inc., which operates a manufacturing plant at Kentwood, Louisiana. The association states that without the suspension
it will be forced to make inefficient qualifying shipments of milk merely to keep the milk of its producers qualified
for pooling under the order.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens
the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to
have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. This action does not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date
of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of the
order regulating the handling of milk in the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 10, 1994 (59 FR 1307), concerning a proposed suspension of certain provisions of the order. Interested
persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views, and arguments thereon. No comments were received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice, and other available information,
it is hereby found and determined that for the period commencing with publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and extending through December 31, 1995, the following provisions of the order do not tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1094.7(c), the words ``45 percent or more of the''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statement of Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The order will suspend through December 1995 the 45 percent delivery requirement for a cooperative association plant
that is located in the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulf Dairy Association, Inc., which operates a manufacturing plant at Kentwood, Louisiana, that is regulated under
Order 94, submitted the suspension request. The cooperative stated that because of the present 45 percent delivery
requirement applicable to a cooperative association that wishes to qualify a manufacturing plant for pooling, it
has had to shift some of its producers to neighboring Greater Louisiana (Order 96) pool plants to keep its Kentwood
plant qualified as a pool plant under Order 94. It indicated that Order 96 requires that six days' production of a producer
must be received at pool plants each month in order to qualify the milk for pooling by diversion to a nonpool plant. Accordingly,
it has had to move the milk of selected producers to Order 96 pool plants six days per month. Since this milk is not actually
needed by these pool plants, the cooperative has then had to back-haul the milk to its Kentwood manufacturing plant
for processing. The problem is now particularly acute, according to the cooperative, because two Order 94 pool plants
have notified Gulf Dairy Association that they will no longer purchase milk from them after February 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulf Dairy Association noted that the problem it is experiencing could be resolved through the proposed merger of
milk orders that is now under consideration by the Department. It urged that the proposed suspension be effective
pending the completion of that proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suspension is found to be necessary for the purpose of assuring that producers' milk will not have to be moved in
an uneconomic and inefficient manner to assure that producers whose milk has long been associated with the New Orleans-Mississippi
marketing area will continue to benefit from pooling and pricing under the order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary
and contrary to the public interest in that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The suspension is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions
in the marketing area, in that such rule is necessary to permit the continued pooling of the milk of dairy farmers who
have historically supplied the market without the need for making costly and inefficient movements of milk; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) This suspension does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective
date; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written
data, views or arguments concerning this suspension. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective less than 30 days from the date of publication in the

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) Models
C75, C85, C90, C125, C145, O&hyph;200, O&hyph;300, and GO&hyph;300 series reciprocating engines, that requires
inspection of the cylinder rocker shaft bosses for cracks, and inspection of the cylinder rocker shaft for looseness
and replacement, if necessary, with a serviceable part. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracked or improperly
repaired cylinder rocker shaft bosses. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent engine power loss
and engine failure.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) Models C75, C85, C90, C125, C145, O&hyph;200, and O&hyph;300 series
reciprocating engines was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 2, 1993 (58 FR 31348). That action proposed to require fluorescent penetrant or etching inspections of the
cylinder rocker shaft bosses for cracks, and dimensional inspections of the cylinder rocker shaft bosses for looseness,
at the next overhaul, in accordance with TCM Overhaul Manual Form X&hyph;30013, dated June 1982, applicable to TCM
Models C125, C145, and O&hyph;300 series engines; and TCM Overhaul Manual Form X&hyph;30010, dated January 1984,
applicable to TCM Models C75, C85, C90, and O&hyph;200 series engines. If the cylinder rocker shaft bosses are cracked,
the cylinder must be replaced. Modified cylinders must be further inspected for cracks that may have been introduced
during the repair process. Cylinders with loose rocker shafts must be replaced with serviceable cylinders, or modified
by installing bushings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that the AD should require compliance at the next 100 hour or annual inspection, whichever occurs
first. The commenter further states that the AD should require visual inspection for wear, broken bosses, or loose
bushings at the earlier compliance time because cylinders with cracked bosses or loose bushing will likely fail before
the cylinder requires overhaul. The FAA does not concur. Service Difficulty Reports and engineering analysis do
not indicate that the shorter compliance time is necessary, and the comment did not include any data as a basis for the
shorter compliance time. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a visual inspection without disassembly could detect
cracks or looseness in the cylinder rocker shaft bosses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that the TCM GO&hyph;300 series engines should be included in the AD. Production of new
cylinders has been standardized by manufacturing the TCM GO&hyph;300 type cylinder only for use on all C&hyph;75
through C&hyph;145, as well as the O&hyph;200 and O&hyph;300 series engines. The commenter maintains that used GO&hyph;300
cylinder assemblies may find their way onto other engines. The GO&hyph;300 shares nearly identical valve train components
with the other engines and is subject to the same type of rocker boss wear and possible failures. The FAA concurs. The
GO&hyph;300 cylinders have been added to the applicability paragraph of this AD.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter further states that TCM Service Bulletin (SB) No. M73&hyph;13 specifies a minimum edge thickness for
the center rocker bosses only. The commenter argues that this requirement for minimum thickness should be redefined
to be a minimum thickness anywhere on any boss because many cylinders have bosses with adequate material on the edges
of the center bosses, but very little material between the edges. The commenter concludes by stating that outer bosses,
also require close scrutiny for thickness, and if an outer boss fails, the center boss will likely be overloaded and
also fail. The FAA does not concur. The center bosses are thinner by design and will therefore wear to the limit sooner
than the outer bosses. If the center bosses have the correct edge to wall thickness, then the outer bosses will be correct
also. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that consideration should be given to securing rocker boss repair bushings with a dowel
pin to prevent rotation after installation. The commenter argues that any lack of concentricity between bushing
ID and OD can severely overload bosses if one or more bushings rotate after installation. The FAA does not concur. If
the repair is accomplished correctly, the bushing will be pressed in and this press fit will prevent rotation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that when performing inspections for cracked bosses on cylinders that have been removed
from the engine, dye penetrant inspection should be allowed in addition to the fluorescent penetrant inspection.
The commenter maintains that dye penetrant inspection is quite effective and reliable when properly performed and
is in widespread use by approved cylinder head repair facilities. The FAA concurs. Dye penetrant inspection has been
added to the AD as an option for compliance. In addition, the FAA has added industry-accepted procedures to the AD for
performing dye penetrant, fluorescent penetrant, and etching inspections in order to standardize the method of
inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 35,600 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this AD, approximately
20,000 four-cylinder engines and 15,600 six-cylinder engines. The FAA estimates that it will take approximately
one-half work hour per cylinder to inspect or install the bushings, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts will cost approximately $11 per cylinder. Based on these figures, the cost impact of the AD for four-cylinder
engines is estimated to be $154 per engine, the cost impact of the AD for six-cylinder engines is estimated to be $231
per engine, and the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $6,683,600. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action

per square centimeter as measured with an appropriate black light meter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) All parts shall be cleaned and dried in such a manner as to leave them free from grease, oil, soaps, alkalies and
other substances which would interfere with inspection. Vapor degreasing is generally suitable for this purpose.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Parts shall be immersed in the penetrant or shall be sprayed or brushed with the penetrant and shall be allowed
to remain immersed in the penetrant or to stand for sufficient time to allow satisfactory penetration into all discontinuities.
This time shall, unless otherwise specified, not be less than 5 minutes. The time for immersion or standing will depend
upon the character and fineness of the discontinuities, the effectiveness of penetration increasing with time.
Parts may be resprayed or re-immersed after standing to increase sensitivity and aid in removal of penetrant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Parts shall be removed from the penetrant and cleaned thoroughly using a medium which will remove penetrant
from the surface of parts; washing with water shall be used when the penetrant is water washable or when an emulsifying
agent is applied to surfaces of parts to render the penetrant water washable. When emulsifiers are used, the parts
shall be dipped in the emulsifier and removed slowly for draining or shall be sprayed with emulsifier and drained.
Unless otherwise specified, the combined dipping and draining time shall be 1 to 5 minutes. When other than water washable
penetrants are used, the penetrant shall be removed with a suitable cleaner or a suitable cleaner and lint-free cloths.
During cleaning, the parts may be viewed under a suitable black light to ensure removal of the penetrant from the subrace
of the part. Excessive cleaning which would remove the penetrant from discontinuities shall be avoided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) When a wet developer is used, the developer shall be applied to the parts, immediately after washing, by immersing
the parts in the tank containing the water-suspended powder or by spraying or flowing the suspension onto the parts.
The suspension shall be suitably agitated either during or immediately prior to application to parts. Immersed parts
shall be removed from the wet developer; excess developer shall be allowed to drain off all parts. Special care shall
be taken to remove excess developer from pockets, recesses, holes, threads, and corners so that the developer will
not mask indications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) When a dry developer or no developer is used, the parts shall be dried as thoroughly as possible by exposure to clean
air. Drying of parts may be accomplished by evaporation at room temperature or by placing the parts in a circulating
warm air oven or in the air stream of a hot air dryer. Excessive drying time or part temperatures higher than 80
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (180
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) should be avoided to prevent evaporation of the penetrant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) When a dry developer is used, the developing powder shall be applied uniformly over the areas of the parts to be
inspected by either dusting or powder-box immersion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) After sufficient time has been allowed to develop indications, parts shall be examined under a black light.
Examination shall be made in a darkened enclosure unless AMS 3157 penetrant is used, in which case examination may
be made under normal shop lighting but shaded from direct sunlight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xiii) When greater sensitivity is desired, the parts may be heated to 65
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;&hyph;85
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (150
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;&hyph;185
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) before immersion in the penetrant and/or before black light examination. To prevent evaporation, preheated
parts shall remain fully immersed in the penetrant until cooled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xiv) Parts shall be cleaned, as necessary, to remove penetrant and developer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xv) Interpretation of the indications revealed by this inspection procedure and final disposition of the parts
shall be the responsibility of only qualified personnel having experience with fluorescent penetrant inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xvi) Parts having discontinuities (cracks) shall be rejected.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 27, 1993, the Secretary of Transportation approved a reorganization of the Office of the Secretary by creating
a new position of Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy and a new position of Assistant Secretary for Aviation
and International Affairs. The title of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs was also changed by this reorganization
to the Assistant to the Secretary and Director of Public Affairs. Thus, it is necessary to amend the relevant parts
of the CFR in order to: (1) Clarify which current CFR delegations apply to the new Assistant Secretary for Transportation
Policy and which apply to the new Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs; (2) reflect the new
title of the head of the Office of Public Affairs; and (3) bring certain other provisions of 49 CFR part 7 into conformity
with 49 CFR 1.57b, now entitled, Delegations to the Assistant General Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights, and
General Law. Until now, all of these CFR parts have referred either to the Assistant Secretary for Policy and International
Affairs, or to the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. A summary of the CFR parts affected follows.

One CFR part (44 CFR part 403), which places restrictions on transportation movements and the transportation of goods
to North Korea or the Communist-controlled area of Vietnam, is jointly administered by the Department of Transportation
and the Department of Commerce. This part will be the subject of joint agency rulemaking at a later date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14 CFR parts 300, 302, 303, 325 and 385 are procedural and organizational regulations concerning aviation economic
proceedings. All references to the Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs are being changed to
the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, and a minor editorial change is being made to &sect;302.22a(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49 CFR part 1 describes the organization of the Department of Transportation and provides for the performance of duties
imposed upon, and the exercise of powers vested in, the Secretary of Transportation by law. Delegations to the Assistant
Secretary for Policy and International Affairs are being transferred to the Assistant Secretary for Transportation
Policy and to the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, as appropriate. Delegations to the
Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs are being transferred to the Assistant to the Secretary and Director of Public
Affairs. Further, &sect;&sect;1.22 and 1.23 are being revised not only to reflect the structure and responsibilities
of the Office of the Secretary as a result of these delegations, but also to reflect the structure and responsibilities
of the Office as a result of earlier reorganizations. Finally, minor editorial changes are being made to &sect;&sect;1.43(c)
and 1.65(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49 CFR part 7 implements the Freedom of Information Act, and prescribes rules governing the availability to the public
of records of the Department of Transportation. Consistent with the delegation of authority to the Assistant General
Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights, and General Law in 49 CFR 1.57b, references to the Assistant Secretary for
Public Affairs in part 7 are being changed to the Assistant General Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights, and General
Law. A minor editorial change is also being made to &sect;7.53(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49 CFR part 8 sets forth procedures for the classification and declassification of national security information
and material. Authority to classify information is being transferred from the Assistant Secretary for Policy and

Since this rule relates to departmental management, organization, procedure, and practice, notice and public comment

Chemical Co., Eastman Kodak Co., P.O. Box 511, Kingsport, TN 37662, proposing that the food additive regulations
in &sect;178.3297 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Colorants for polymers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 178.3297) be amended to provide for the safe use of 2,2
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-(1,2-ethenediyldi-4,1-phenylene)bis(benzoxazole) as an optical brightener for food-contact polymers.
Subsequently, after a company reorganization, Eastman Chemical Co. is no longer part of Eastman Kodak Co.; it is now
referred to only as Eastman Chemical Co.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed food additive
use is safe, and that 21 CFR 178.3297 should be amended as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before April 4, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 28, 1991, the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 3061) by cross reference to temporary regulations (56 FR 3034) that proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations
under section 6851 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These regulations implemented section 1001(d) of the Technical
and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;647, 102 Stat. 3342. Comments responding to the notice
of proposed rulemaking were received but no public hearing was requested or held. After consideration of the written
comments, the IRS adopts the proposed regulations as revised by this Treasury decision.

Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations exempt certain alien students, industrial trainees, and exchange visitors, and their spouses and
children, from the requirement of obtaining a certificate of compliance with the U.S. income tax laws before they
depart the United States. Aliens exempt from the requirements are those admitted to the United States solely on an
F&hyph;1, F&hyph;2, H&hyph;3, H&hyph;4, J&hyph;1, or J&hyph;2 visa, who have received no gross income from U.S.
sources other than: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowances to cover expenses incident to study in the United States, (2) the value of any services or accommodations
furnished incident to that study, (3) income derived in accordance with the employment authorizations in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)
and (c) that apply to the alien's visa or (4) interest on deposits described in section 871(i)(2)(A). Furthermore,
aliens admitted solely on an M&hyph;1 or M&hyph;2 visa who have received no gross income other than that derived in
accordance with the employment authorization in 8 CFR 274a.12 (c)(6) or described in section 871(i)(2)(A) are also
exempt from the requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments received were very positive. Accordingly, the regulations adopt the provisions of the notice of proposed
rulemaking, with only minor changes. In response to a comment, the words ``or training'' are added immediately after
the word ``study'' in &sect;1.6851&hyph;2(a)(2)(ii) (A) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

) and (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to clarify that the regulations apply to payments incident to training as well as study. In addition, a commentator
suggested that the exemption should apply to amounts, such as travel allowances, that may be received by students
or trainees when not physically present in the United States. These regulations clarify that such amounts are covered
by the exemption as well, assuming that the other requirements of the regulations have been met. The final regulations
also provide that the exemption covers amounts received that are exempt from United States taxation under section
871(i)(2)(A), relating to certain interest on deposits.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.

determining gross rent; and the inclusion of the cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain services in gross rent. The regulations incorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and expand upon the guidance provided by Notice 89&hyph;1, 1989&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C.B. 620, and Notice 89&hyph;6, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 625. This information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will assist State and local housing credit agencies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayers in complying with the requirements of section 42. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations affect taxpayers that apply for or claim the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income housing tax credit and State and local housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit agencies.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 29, 1992, the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 61852) proposing amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 42 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. These amendments provide guidance on several requirements of the low-income housing tax
credit and incorporate and expand upon the guidance provided by Notices 89&hyph;1 and 89&hyph;6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments responding to the notice of proposed rulemaking were received. A public hearing was scheduled for
February 16, 1993, pursuant to a notice of public hearing published simultaneously with the notice of proposed rulemaking.
However, the IRS received no requests to speak at the public hearing by the designated date. On February 8, 1993, the
IRS published a notice (58 FR 7497) cancelling the public hearing on the proposed regulations. After consideration
of the comments received, the proposed regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision.

Carryover Allocations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 42 provides for a low-income housing credit that may be claimed as part of the general business credit under
section 38. In general, the credit is allowable only to the extent that the owner of a qualified low-income building
receives a housing credit allocation from a State or local housing credit agency (Agency). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 42(h)(1)(E), an allocation may be made to a qualified building that has not yet been placed in service,
provided the building is placed in service not later than the close of the second calendar year following the calendar
year of the allocation (a carryover allocation). Section 42(h)(1)(E)(ii) defines a qualified building as any building
that is part of a project if the taxpayer's basis in the project (as of the close of the calendar year of the allocation)
is more than 10 percent of the taxpayer's reasonably expected basis in the project (as of the close of the second calendar
year following the calendar year of the allocation). For these purposes, the taxpayer's basis equals the taxpayer's
basis in land and depreciable property. See 2 H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1104, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. II&hyph;82 (1988), 1988&hyph;3
C.B. 572. A carryover allocation may also be made to a multiple-building project under section 42(h)(1)(F). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commentators requested clarification on when a carryover allocation is treated as if it had never been made. The final
regulations clarify that only a failure to satisfy a requirement of section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F) that must be satisfied
by the close of the calendar year of allocation will cause a carryover allocation to be treated as if it had not been made.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations provide that a taxpayer does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have carryover-allocation basis in a project unless, by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close of the calendar year of allocation, the taxpayer is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner, for federal income tax purposes, of land or depreciable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
real property expected to be part of the project. The final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations do not explicitly contain this requirement. After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further consideration, the IRS believes that satisfaction of the requirements of &sect;1.42&hyph;6 is sufficient
to ensure that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer intends to complete a qualified low-income housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project. For example, if a taxpayer has basis in land or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depreciable property that is reasonably expected to be part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a project and the requirements of &sect;1.42&hyph;6 are otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfied, the taxpayer has carryover-allocation basis with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the land or depreciable property. This basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes all items that are properly capitalizable with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the land or depreciable property. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notwithstanding the rule in Notice 89&hyph;1 to the contrary, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonrefundable downpayment for, or an amount paid to acquire an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option to purchase, land or depreciable property may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in carryover-allocation basis if properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capitalizable into the basis of land or depreciable property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is reasonably expected to be part of a project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commentators objected to the exclusion of credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application fees from carryover-allocation basis and requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the final regulations permit these fees to be included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryover-allocation basis. On further consideration, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appears that an absolute prohibition against the inclusion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application fees (and compliance monitoring fees, which were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also not included) in carryover-allocation basis is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted. Accordingly, the final regulations subject credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application and compliance monitoring fees to the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards imposed upon other fees under the regulations. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, if a fee is properly capitalizable as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer's basis in land or depreciable property that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably expected to be part of a project, the fee is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in carryover-allocation basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Verification of Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations provide verification requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and procedures that an Agency must follow to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum basis requirement that is required to be met by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close of the year of allocation is, in fact, met. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commentator suggested that the basis verification requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are too burdensome to Agencies and that Agencies lack the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise to verify the costs includible in basis. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IRS does not expect Agencies to audit projects or make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal determinations. Rather, the proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that an Agency may verify the basis requirement by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring the taxpayer to obtain a certification from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attorney or certified public accountant that the taxpayer has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred the minimum required basis by the close of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year of allocation. Accordingly, the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations adopt the basis verification requirement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Requirements for Making Carryover Allocations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations provide guidance on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information needed for carryover allocation documents. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commentator suggested that the final regulations clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a newly constructed building that receives an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation of credit in different calendar years must have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate Form 8609 for each allocation and, if so, whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same building identification number (B.I.N.) should be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations clarify that, in this and similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations, a separate Form 8609 is necessary for both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocations and that the B.I.N. assigned to the building for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first allocation also is used for the subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Use by the General Public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislative history of section 42 provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residential rental units must be for use by the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public. Residential rental units are not for use by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general public, for example, if the units are provided only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for members of a social organization or provided by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer for its employees. The proposed regulations provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an exception for an employer-provided resident manager unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is a facility reasonably required by a project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commentators suggested that the exception for a resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager unit be expanded to include a unit occupied by a full-time maintenance person. After further review, IRS the
Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Treasury have concluded that the reference to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident manager unit in the proposed regulations was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate because the general public use requirement only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies to residential rental units. A unit that is occupied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a full-time resident manager or a full-time maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person is not a residential rental unit but is a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably required by a project. See Rev. Rul. 92&hyph;61, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992&hyph;2 C.B. 7. Accordingly, the final regulations remove the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to a resident manager unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Utility Allowances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commentator suggested that the final regulations provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that in areas where there is a utility allowance increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without a corresponding increase in area median gross income, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an owner may adjust the rent upwards so that rent receipts do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not decrease below the minimum rent floor of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42(g)(2)(A). Because a change of this nature requires an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment to the statute, the final regulations do not adopt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code, the notice of the proposed rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their impact on small business.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Carryover allocations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A carryover allocation is an allocation that meets the requirements of section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F). If the requirements
of section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F) that are required to be satisfied by the close of the calendar year are not satisfied,
the allocation is treated as if it had not been made. For example, if the taxpayer's basis in the project as of the close
of the calendar year of allocation is not more than 10 percent of the taxpayer's reasonably expected basis in the project
as of the close of the second calendar year following the year of allocation, the carryover allocation is not valid
and is treated as if it had not been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Carryover-allocation basis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Subject to the limitations of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a taxpayer's basis in a project for purposes of section
42(h)(1) (E)(ii) or (F) (carryover-allocation basis) is the taxpayer's adjusted basis in land or depreciable property
that is reasonably expected to be part of the project, whether or not these amounts are includible in eligible basis
under section 42(d). Thus, for example, if the project is to include property that is not residential rental property,
such as commercial space, the basis attributable to the commercial space, although not includible in eligible basis,
is includible in carryover-allocation basis. The adjusted basis of land and depreciable property is determined
under sections 1012 and 1016, and generally includes the direct and indirect costs of acquiring, constructing, and
rehabilitating the property. Costs otherwise includible in carryover-allocation basis are not excluded by reason
of having been incurred prior to the calendar year in which the carryover allocation is made.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_For purposes of determining carryover-allocation basis under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the following
limitations apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Taxpayer must have basis in land or depreciable property related to the project. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A taxpayer has carryover-allocation basis to the extent that it has basis in land or depreciable property and the land
or depreciable property is reasonably expected to be part of the project for which the carryover allocation is made.
This basis includes all items that are properly capitalizable with respect to the land or depreciable property. For
example, a nonrefundable downpayment for, or an amount paid to acquire an option to purchase, land or depreciable
property may be included in carryover-allocation basis if properly capitalizable into the basis of land or depreciable
property that is reasonably expected to be part of a project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
High cost areas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Any increase in eligible basis that may result under section 42(d)(5)(C) from a building's location in a qualified
census tract or difficult development area is not taken into account in determining carryover-allocation basis
or reasonably expected basis.

(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Amounts not treated as paid or incurred
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not includible in carryover-allocation basis unless it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as paid or incurred under the method of accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used by the taxpayer. For example, a cash method taxpayer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot include construction costs in carryover-allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis unless the costs have been paid, and an accrual method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer cannot include construction costs in carryover- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation basis unless they have been properly accrued. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section for a special rule for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fees
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A fee is includible in carryover-allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis only to the extent the requirements of paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2)(iii) of this section are met and_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The fee is reasonable; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The taxpayer is legally obligated to pay the fee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The fee is capitalizable as part of the taxpayer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis in land or depreciable property that is reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to be part of the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The fee is not paid (or to be paid) by the taxpayer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) If the fee is paid (or to be paid) by the taxpayer to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related person, and the taxpayer uses the cash method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting, the taxpayer could properly accrue the fee under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the accrual method of accounting (considering, for example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rules of section 461(h)). A person is a related person if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the person bears a relationship to the taxpayer specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 267(b) or 707(b)(1), or if the person and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer are engaged in trades or businesses under common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control (within the meaning of subsections (a) and (b) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 52).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasonably expected basis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Rules similar to the rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the taxpayer's reasonably expected basis in a project (land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and depreciable basis) as of the close of the second calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year following the calendar year of the allocation.

Facts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. C, an accrual-method taxpayer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives a carryover allocation from Agency, the state housing credit agency, in September of 1993. As of that date,
C has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not begun construction of the low-income housing building C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans to build. However, C has owned the land on which C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans to build the building since 1985. C's basis in the land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is $100,000. C reasonably expects that by the end of 1995, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C's basis in the project of which the building is to be a part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be $2,000,000. C also expects that because the project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is located in a qualified census tract, C will be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase its basis in the project to $2,600,000. Before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close of 1993, C incurs $150,000 of costs for architects' fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and site preparation. C properly accrues these costs under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its method of accounting and capitalizes the costs.

. C's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$100,000 basis in the land is includible in carryover-allocation basis even though C has owned the land since 1985.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The $150,000 of costs C has incurred for architects' fees and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site preparation are also includible in carryover-allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. The expected increase in basis due to the project's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location in a qualified census tract is not taken into account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in determining C's carryover-allocation basis. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C's carryover-allocation basis in the project of which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building is a part is $250,000.

second calendar year following the calendar year of allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is $2,000,000. The expected increase in eligible basis due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the project's location in a qualified census tract is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken into account in determining this amount. Because C's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryover-allocation basis is more than 10 percent of C's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably expected basis in the project of which the building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a part, the building for which C received the carryover

. D, an accrual-method taxpayer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives a carryover allocation from Agency, the state housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit agency, on September 11, 1993. As of that date, D has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not begun construction of the low-income housing building D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans to build and D does not have basis in the land on which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D plans to build the building. In 1993, D incurs some costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to the planned building, including architects' fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, at the close of 1993, these costs do not exceed 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of D's reasonably expected basis in the project.

percent of D's reasonably expected basis in the project of

which the building is a part, the building for which D

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of section 42(h)(1)(E)(ii) and paragraph (a) of

is treated as if it had not been made.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Manner of verification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An Agency may verify that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer has incurred more than 10 percent of its reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected basis in a project by obtaining a certification from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the taxpayer, in writing and under penalty of perjury, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the taxpayer has incurred by the close of the calendar year of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the allocation more than 10 percent of the reasonably expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis in the project. The certification must be accompanied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by supporting documentation that the Agency must review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supporting documentation may include, for example, copies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checks or other records of payments. Alternatively, an Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may verify that the taxpayer has incurred adequate basis by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring that the taxpayer obtain from an attorney or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified public accountant a written certification to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency, that the attorney or accountant has examined all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible costs incurred with respect to the project and that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based upon this examination, it is the attorney's or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountant's belief that the taxpayer has incurred more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 percent of its reasonably expected basis in the project by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the close of the calendar year of the allocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Time of verification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An Agency may require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis certification be submitted to or received by the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the close of the calendar year of allocation or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within a reasonable time after the close of the calendar year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of allocation. The Agency will need to verify basis in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to accurately complete the Form 8610, Annual Low-Income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Housing Credit Agencies Report, for the calendar year. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification is not timely made, or supporting documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is lacking, inadequate, or does not actually support the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, the Agency should notify the taxpayer and try 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to get adequate documentation. If the Agency cannot verify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the Form 8610 is filed that the taxpayer has satisfied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis requirement for a carryover allocation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation is treated as if it had not been made and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryover allocation document should not be filed with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form 8610.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Generally, an allocation is made when an Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues the Form 8609, Low-Income Housing Credit Allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certification, for a building. See &sect;1.42&hyph;1T(d)(8)(ii). An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency does not issue the Form 8609 for a building until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building is placed in service. However, in cases where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocations of credit are made pursuant to section 42(h)(1)(E) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(relating to carryover allocations for buildings) or section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42(h)(1)(F) (relating to carryover allocations for multiple-building projects), Form 8609 is not used as the allocating

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document because the buildings are not yet in service. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an allocation is made pursuant to section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F), the allocating document is the document meeting the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, when an allocation is made pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42(h)(1)(F), the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section must be met for the allocation to be valid. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation pursuant to section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F) reduces the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state housing credit ceiling for the year in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation is made, whether or not the Form 8609 is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued in that year.

the year an allocation is first made to the building, regardless of the year that the building is placed in service.
This B.I.N. must be used for all allocations of credit for the building. For example, rehabilitation expenditures
treated as a separate new building under section 42(e) should not have a separate B.I.N. if the building to which the
rehabilitation expenditures are made has a B.I.N. In this case, the B.I.N. used for the rehabilitation expenditures
shall be the B.I.N. previously assigned to the building, although the rehabilitation expenditures must have a separate
Form 8609 for the allocation. Similarly, a newly constructed building that receives an allocation of credit in different
calendar years must have a separate Form 8609 for each allocation. The B.I.N. assigned to the building for the first
allocation must be used for the subsequent allocation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to taxpayers that own projects through partnerships or other flow-through entities (e.g., S corporations,
estates, or trusts), carryover-allocation basis is determined at the entity level using the rules provided by this
section. In addition, the entity is responsible for providing to the Agency the certification and documentation
required under the basis verification requirement in paragraph (c) of this section.

 If land or depreciable property that is expected to be part of a project is transferred after a carryover allocation
has been made for a building that is reasonably expected to be part of the project, but before the close of the calendar
year of the allocation, the transferee's carryover-allocation basis is determined under the principles of this
section and section 42(d)(7). See also Rev. Rul. 91&hyph;38, 1991&hyph;2 C.B. 3 (see &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I), an agreement between a taxpayer and an Agency as to the housing credit
dollar amount to be allocated to a building is considered binding if it_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is in writing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is binding under state law on the Agency, the taxpayer, and all successors in interest; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Specifies the type(s) of building(s) to which the housing credit dollar amount applies (i.e., a newly constructed
or existing building, or substantial rehabilitation treated as a separate new building under section 42(e)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Specifies the housing credit dollar amount to be allocated to the building(s); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Is dated and signed by the taxpayer and the Agency during the month in which the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)
(i) through (iv) of this section are met.

Effect on state housing credit ceiling.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Generally, a binding agreement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is an agreement by the Agency to allocate
credit to the taxpayer at a future date. The binding agreement may include a reservation of credit or a binding commitment
(under section 42(h)(1)(C)) to allocate credit in a future taxable year. A reservation or a binding commitment to
allocate credit in a future year has no effect on the state housing credit ceiling until the year the Agency actually
makes an allocation. However, if the binding agreement is also a carryover allocation under section 42(h)(1) (E)
or (F), the state housing credit ceiling is reduced by the amount allocated by the Agency to the taxpayer in the year
the carryover allocation is made. For a binding agreement to be a valid carryover allocation, the requirements of
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and &sect;1.42&hyph;6 must be met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer may not make an election under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) for a building if an election has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously been made for the building for a different month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, assume a taxpayer entered into a binding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement for allocation of a specific housing credit dollar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount to a building and made the election under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) to apply the appropriate percentage for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month of the binding agreement. If the binding agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequently is rescinded under state law, and the taxpayer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enters into a new binding agreement for allocation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific housing credit dollar amount to the building, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer must apply to the building the appropriate percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the elected month of the rescinded binding agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if no prior election was made with respect to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rescinded binding agreement, the taxpayer may elect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate percentage for the month of the new binding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increases in credit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The election under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I), once made, applies to any increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit amount allocated for a building, whether the increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs in the same or in a subsequent year. However, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case of a binding agreement (or carryover allocation that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as a binding agreement) to allocate a credit amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 42(e)(1) for substantial rehabilitation treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a separate new building, a taxpayer may make the election 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) notwithstanding that a prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) is in effect for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior allocation of credit for a substantial rehabilitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that was previously placed in service under section 42(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Amount allocated. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The housing credit dollar amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eventually allocated to a building may be more or less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount specified in the binding agreement. Depending on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency's determination pursuant to section 42(m)(2) as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the financial feasibility of the building (or project), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency may allocate a greater housing credit dollar amount to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the building (provided that the Agency has additional housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit dollar amounts available to allocate for the calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year of the allocation) or the Agency may allocate a lesser 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit dollar amount. Under section 42(h)(7)(D), in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocating a housing credit dollar amount, the Agency must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify the applicable percentage and maximum qualified basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the building. The applicable percentage may be less, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not greater than, the appropriate percentage for the month the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building is placed in service, or the month elected by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I). Whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate percentage is the appropriate percentage for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
70-percent present value credit or the 30-percent present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value credit is determined under section 42(i)(2) when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building is placed in service.

Examples.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following examples illustrate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of this section. In each example, X is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer, Agency is the state housing credit agency, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryover allocations meet the requirements of &sect;1.42&hyph;6 and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise valid. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) In August 1993, X and Agency enter into an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement that Agency will allocate $100,000 of housing credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollar amount for the low-income housing building X is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructing. The agreement is binding and meets all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement is a reservation of credit, not an allocation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, has no effect on the state housing credit ceiling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On or before September 5, 1993, X signs and has notarized a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written election statement that meets the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The applicable percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the building is the appropriate percentage for the month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of August 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Agency makes a carryover allocation of $100,000 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit dollar amount for the building on October 2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993. The carryover allocation reduces Agency's state housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit ceiling for 1993. Due to unexpectedly high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction costs, when X places the building in service in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1994, the product of the building's qualified basis and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicable percentage for the building (the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage for the month of August 1993) is $150,000, rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than $100,000. Notwithstanding that only $100,000 of credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was allocated for the building in 1993, Agency may allocate an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional $50,000 of housing credit dollar amount for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building from its state housing credit ceiling for 1994. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate percentage for the month of August 1993 is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable percentage for the building for the entire $150,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of credit allocated for the building, even though separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocations were made in 1993 and 1994. Because allocations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were made for the building in two separate calendar years, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency must issue two Forms 8609 to X. One Form 8609 must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the $100,000 allocation made in 1993, and the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form 8609 must reflect the $50,000 allocation made in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) X gives the original notarized statement to Agency on or before September 5, 1993, and retains a copy of the binding

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement, election statement, and carryover allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document. X files a copy of the binding agreement, election 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement, and carryover allocation document with X's Form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8609 for the first taxable year in which X claims credit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Agency files the original of the binding agreement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election statement, and 1993 carryover allocation document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with its 1993 Form 8610. Agency retains a copy of the binding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement, election statement, and carryover allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document. After the building is placed in service in 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency issues to X a copy of the Form 8609 reflecting the 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryover allocation of $100,000 and files the original of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that form with its 1994 Form 8610. Agency also files the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original of the 1994 Form 8609 reflecting the $50,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation with its 1994 Form 8610 and issues to X a copy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1994 Form 8609. Agency retains copies of the Forms 8609 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are issued to X. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) In September 1993, X and Agency enter into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an agreement that Agency will allocate $70,000 of housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit dollar amount for rehabilitation expenditures that X is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurring and that X will treat as a new low-income housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building under section 42(e)(1). The agreement is binding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets all the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. The agreement is a reservation of credit, not an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation, and therefore, has no effect on Agency's state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing credit ceiling. On or before October 5, 1993, X signs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and has notarized a written election statement that meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable percentage for the building is the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage for the month of September 1993. Agency makes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryover allocation of $70,000 of housing credit dollar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount for the building on November 15, 1993. The carryover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation reduces by $70,000 Agency's state housing credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ceiling for 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In October 1994, X and Agency enter into another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
binding agreement meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. Under the agreement, Agency will allocate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$50,000 of housing credit dollar amount for additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation expenditures by X that qualify as a second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate new building under section 42(e)(1). On or before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 5, 1994, X signs and has notarized a written election 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. On December 1, 1994, X receives a carryover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation under section 42(h)(1)(E) for $50,000. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryover allocation reduces by $50,000 Agency's state housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit ceiling for 1994. The applicable percentage for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation expenditures treated as the second separate new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building is the appropriate percentage for the month of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1994, not September 1993. The appropriate percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the month of September 1993 still applies to the allocation of $70,000 for the rehabilitation expenditures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as the first separate new building. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocations were made for the building in two separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar years, Agency must issue two Forms 8609 to X. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form 8609 must reflect the $70,000 allocation made in 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the other Form 8609 must reflect the $50,000 allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) X gives the first original notarized statement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency on or before October 5, 1993, and retains a copy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first binding agreement, election statement, and carryover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation document issued in 1993. X gives the second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original notarized statement to Agency on or before November 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5, 1994, and retains a copy of the second binding agreement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election statement, and carryover allocation document issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1994. X files a copy of the binding agreements, election 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements, and carryover allocation documents with X's Forms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8609 for the first taxable year in which X claims credit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Agency retains a copy of the binding agreements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election statements, and carryover allocation documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency files the original of the first binding agreement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election statement, and 1993 carryover allocation document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with its 1993 Form 8610. Agency files the original of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second binding agreement, election statement, and 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carryover allocation document with its 1994 Form 8610. After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
X notifies Agency of the date each building is placed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service, the Agency will issue copies of the respective Forms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8609 to X, and file the originals of those forms with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency's Form 8610 that reflects the year each form is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also retains copies of the Forms 8609.

the election is made, the appropriate percentage elected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies for the building even if all bonds are not issued in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that month. The requirements of this paragraph (b), including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a residential rental unit in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building is not for use by the general public, the unit is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible for a section 42 credit. A residential rental unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is for use by the general public if the unit is rented in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner consistent with housing policy governing non-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination, as evidenced by rules or regulations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (24 CFR subtitle A and chapters I through XX). See HUD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Handbook 4350.3 (or its successor). A copy of HUD Handbook 4350.3 may be requested by writing to: HUD, Directives Distribution
Section, room B&hyph;100, 451 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, if a residential rental unit is provided only for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member of a social organization or provided by an employer for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its employees, the unit is not for use by the general public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is not eligible for credit under section 42. In addition, any residential rental unit that is part of a hospital,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing home, sanitarium, lifecare facility, trailer park, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediate care facility for the mentally and physically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handicapped is not for use by the general public and is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible for credit under section 42. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Treatment of units not for use by the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The costs attributable to a residential rental unit that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not for use by the general public are not excludable from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible basis by reason of the unit's ineligibility for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit under this section. However, in calculating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable fraction, the unit is treated as a residential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rental unit that is not a low-income unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inclusion of utility allowances in gross rent. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of any utilities (other than telephone) for a residential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rental unit are paid directly by the tenant(s), the gross rent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for that unit includes the applicable utility allowance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined under this section. This section only applies for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of determining gross rent under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42(g)(2)(B)(ii) as to rent-restricted units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Applicable utility allowances
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FmHA-assisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
buildings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a building receives assistance from the Farmers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Administration (FmHA-assisted building), the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility allowance for all rent-restricted units in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building is the utility allowance determined under the method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building. For example, if a building receives assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under FmHA's section 515 program (whether or not the building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or its tenants also receive other state or federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance), the applicable utility allowance for all rent-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restricted units in the building is determined using Exhibit A&hyph;6 of 7 CFR part 1944, subpart E (or a successor
method of determining utility allowances). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Buildings with FmHA assisted tenants. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If any tenant in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a building receives FmHA rental assistance payments (FmHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tenant assistance), the applicable utility allowance for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rent-restricted units in the building (including any units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupied by tenants receiving HUD rental assistance payments) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the applicable FmHA utility allowance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD-regulated buildings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If neither a building nor any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tenant in the building receives FmHA housing assistance, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rents and utility allowances of the building are reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by HUD on an annual basis (HUD-regulated building), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable utility allowance for all rent-restricted units in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the building is the applicable HUD utility allowance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other buildings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a building is neither an FmHA-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assisted nor a HUD-regulated building, and no tenant in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building receives FmHA tenant assistance, the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility allowance for rent-restricted units in the building is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined under the following methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tenants receiving HUD rental assistance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable utility allowance for any rent-restricted units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupied by tenants receiving HUD rental assistance payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HUD tenant assistance) is the applicable Public Housing Authority (PHA) utility allowance established for the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8 Existing Housing Program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If none of the rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (3), and (4)(i) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to any rent-restricted units in a building, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate utility allowance for the units is the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PHA utility allowance. However, if a local utility company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate is obtained for any unit in the building in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate becomes the appropriate utility allowance for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rent-restricted units of similar size and construction in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building. This local utility company estimate procedure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not available for and does not apply to units to which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules of paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (3), or (4)(i) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Utility company estimate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any interested party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including a low-income tenant, a building owner, or an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency) may obtain a local utility company estimate for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit. The estimate is obtained when the interested party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives, in writing, information from a local utility company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing the estimated cost of that utility for a unit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar size and construction for the geographic area in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the building containing the unit is located. The local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility company estimate may be obtained by an interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party at any time during the building's extended use period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see section 42(h)(6)(D)) or, if the building does not have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended use period, during the building's compliance period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see section 42(i)(1)). Unless the parties agree otherwise, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs incurred in obtaining the estimate are borne by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiating party. The interested party that obtains the local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility company estimate (the initiating party) must retain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the original of the utility company estimate and must furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a copy of the local utility company estimate to the owner of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the building (where the initiating party is not the owner), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Agency that allocated credit to the building (where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the initiating party is not the Agency). The owner of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building must make available copies of the utility company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate to the tenants in the building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Changes in applicable utility allowance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If at any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time during the building's extended use period (or, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building does not have an extended use period, the building's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance period), the applicable utility allowance for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit changes, the new utility allowance must be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compute gross rents of rent-restricted units due 90 days after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change. For example, if rent must be lowered because a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local utility company estimate is obtained that shows a higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility cost than the otherwise applicable PHA utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowance, the lower rent must be in effect for rent due more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 90 days after the date of the local utility company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The furnishing to tenants of services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than housing (whether or not the services are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant) does not prevent the units occupied by the tenants from qualifying as residential rental property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible for credit under section 42. However, any charges to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income tenants for services that are not optional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally must be included in gross rent for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 42(g).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service is optional if payment for the service is not required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a condition of occupancy. For example, for a qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income building with a common dining facility, the cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meals is not included in gross rent for purposes of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42(g)(2)(A) if payment for the meals in the facility is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required as a condition of occupancy and a practical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative exists for tenants to obtain meals other than from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the dining facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Continual or frequent services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If continual or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent nursing, medical, or psychiatric services are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided, it is presumed that the services are not optional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the building is ineligible for the credit, as is the case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a hospital, nursing home, sanitarium, lifecare facility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or intermediate care facility for the mentally and physically

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services that are required as a condition of occupancy must be

Section

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for supportive services. For purposes of section

42(g)(2)(B)(iii), a supportive service is any service provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a planned program of services designed to enable

residents of a residential rental property to remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent and avoid placement in a hospital, nursing home, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or intermediate care facility for the mentally or physically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handicapped. For a building described in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42(i)(3)(B)(iii) (relating to transitional housing for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends &sect;301.6611&hyph;1 on Procedure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration. The amendments clarify the period during which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest is allowed on overpayments credited against a taxpayer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability for interest and certain additions to the tax. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments are necessary as a result of changes to the law made by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. The amendments affect all taxpayers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that have overpayments credited against underpayments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This document amends the regulations on Procedure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration (26 CFR part 301) under section 6611 of the Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Code (Code) to clarify the period during which interest is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed on overpayments that are credited against a taxpayer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability for interest and certain additions to the tax. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments conform the regulations to section 344 of the Tax Equity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) (Pub. L. 97&hyph;248, 96 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stat. 635), and section 158 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(DEFRA) (Pub. L. 98&hyph;369, 98 Stat. 696). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 25, 1992, the IRS published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (57 FR 38457). The IRS did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive any comment letters in response to that notice nor was a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public hearing requested. The proposed regulations are adopted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Treasury decision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6611(a) of the Code provides that interest shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed and paid on any overpayment in respect of any internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revenue tax at the overpayment rate established under section 6621. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 6402(a), the Secretary may credit any overpayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including any interest allowed thereon) against any liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed under the Code on the taxpayer. Under section 6611(b)(1), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest is allowed on an overpayment that is so credited from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of the overpayment to the due date of the taxpayer's liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against which the overpayment is credited. For purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest computation, specific due dates are provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;301.6611&hyph;1(h). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, section 6601(f) provides that once an overpayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is credited to satisfy a taxpayer's liability, interest no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrues on that liability. Section 344 of TEFRA added section 6622 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Code, which requires interest imposed by the Code to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounded daily. The effect of section 6601(f) on the compounding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement of section 6622 is that once an overpayment is credited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to satisfy the taxpayer's liability for interest, that credit cuts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off any further compounding of that interest (i.e., interest no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer accrues on the taxpayer's interest liability against which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the credit has been made). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, it is appropriate that no interest liability to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer accrues on the overpayment once the overpayment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credited to satisfy the taxpayer's liability for interest. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;301.6611&hyph;1(h)(2)(v) is amended to clarify that interest does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to accrue on any portion of an overpayment that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credited against the taxpayer's liability for interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to DEFRA, interest only accrued on additions to the tax from the date of notice and demand, and then only if not
paid within 10 days from the date of notice and demand. In section 158 of DEFRA, Congress added section 6601(e)(2)(B)
to the Code, which requires taxpayers to pay interest on certain additions to tax from the due date of the relevant return
(including any extensions) until the addition to the tax is paid. The number of additions to the tax that bear interest
from the due date of the return was increased by Congress in 1988 and again in 1989. Thus, &sect;301.6611&hyph;1(h)(2)(vi)
is amended to clarify that no interest is allowed on any portion of an overpayment that is credited against certain
additions to the tax for any period after the due date of the return (including extensions) to which the addition to
the tax relates.

Prior Regulations Obsolete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations are effective for credits made on or after August 25, 1992. It should be noted that, since the enactment
of section 6622 of the Code in TEFRA, the IRS has treated &sect;301.6611&hyph;1(h)(2)(v) of the prior regulations
as obsolete. Likewise, the Service has treated &sect;301.6611&hyph;1(h)(2)(vi) of the prior regulations as obsolete
with respect to certain additions to the tax since the enactment of section 6601(e)(2)(B) in DEFRA. Thus, the IRS has
computed and is currently computing interest in a fashion consistent with these amendments.

Effect on Other Documents

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1984, the IRS published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (49 FR 39566 [LR&hyph;280&hyph;82, 1984&hyph;2 C.B. 860]) proposed amendments to &sect;301.6611&hyph;1 and &sect;301.6601&hyph;1
on Procedure and Administration. The proposed amendments revised &sect;301.6611&hyph;1 to reflect section 346
of TEFRA and section 714(n) of DEFRA, eliminated certain deadwood provisions, and reorganized &sect;301.6611&hyph;1.
The proposed amendments did not, however, include revisions to take into account section 344 of TEFRA or section 158
of DEFRA because those sections were beyond the scope of that regulation project. The proposed amendments have not
been adopted as final regulations. If the proposed amendments are adopted as final regulations, their rules (and,
to the extent necessary, their effective dates) will be modified to be consistent with these regulations.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is reinstating the temporary regulations governing the operation of the Evergreen Point Bridge (State
Route 520) across Lake Washington between Seattle and Bellevue, Washington. This rule will be in effect through June
30, 1994. The amended regulations will provide for the reasonable needs of navigation and allow the bridge owner to
provide openings only during periods of reduced vehicular traffic if 12 hours notice is furnished. The purpose of
this measure is to avoid risking failure of the drawspan in the open position during commuter hours as has previously
occurred. The hours of limited operation insure sufficient time for the owner to restore the retractable span to the
closed position before road traffic becomes heavy. During the period that this rule is in effect malfunctions of the
draw mechanism will be analyzed and repaired.

Regulatory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This same regulation was put into effect on September 21, 1992. It has since expired. On November 2, 1993, the Coast
Guard published a proposed rule (58 FR 58518) to consider the reinstatement of the temporary regulations. The Commander,
Thirteenth Coast Guard District, also published a public notice on November 19, 1993. Both articles solicited comments
from interested parties until December 17, 1993. No objections to the temporary regulations were received. A public
hearing was not requested and was not held.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The temporary regulations allow the bridge owner to limit openings for the passage of vessels to late at night. These
restricted hours of operation enable the owner to restore the bridge to the closed position in the event of a malfunction
prior to the daylight hours of heavy commuter traffic. Openings during the day are excluded. With 12 hours notice,
the bridge will be opened from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday night through Friday morning and from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Friday night
through Sunday morning. The hours for opening on weeknights are more restricted to give greater time to restore the
drawspan in the event of a failure prior to the start of heavy commuter traffic.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This temporary final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not
significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,
1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impacts of this rule to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.
We base our decision on the light and infrequent commercial traffic on the subject waterways during the hours affected
by this rule.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) the U.S. Coast Guard must consider whether rules will
have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act. Because this final rule imposes no new requirements on small
businesses and will result in partial relief from a regulatory burden on the owner or operator of these bridges, the
Coast Guard does not expect this rule to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is categorically
excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination has been prepared and
placed in the rulemaking docket.

 The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone in the Intracoastal Waterway at Bakers Haulover Inlet Florida. This
safety zone is needed to protect vessels from a safety hazard associated with severe shoaling in the channel between
Biscayne Bay daybeacon 6 (light list number 41185) and Biscayne Bay light 9 (light list number 41210). Entry into this
safety zone by tugs towing or pushing barges with drafts exceeding four feet, beams exceeding 16 feet, and all barges
carrying oil, or hazardous material is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Miami, Florida or
his designated representative.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This safety zone is needed to protect vessels from a safety hazard associated with severe shoaling in the channel between
Biscayne Bay daybeacon 6, (light list number 41185) and Biscayne Bay light 9 (light list number 41210). There have
been several recent tug and barge groundings caused by the current channel conditions, and the potential for a severe
marine casualty is great if unrestricted commercial vessel traffic is allowed to continue. This area of the channel
is scheduled to be dredged to its published depth between February 7, 1994 and April 11, 1994. Until the channel is dredged,
entry into this safety zone by tugs towing or pushing barges with drafts exceeding four feet, beams exceeding 16 feet,
and all barges carrying oil, or hazardous material is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Miami,
Florida or his designated representative.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant
under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). The economic
impact of this proposal is expected to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. The safety zone
will only be in effect 5 hours of one day, February 11, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

 This document contains corrections to a final rule which was published on April 8, 1981 relating to approval of a Minnesota
State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision consisting of a sulfur dioxide control plan and emission limitations contained
in revised operating permits for the Rochester and Twin Cities nonattainment area. This technical amendment corrects
an error of codification in the CFR and prevents further confusion in citing the Minnesota SIP revision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 8, 1981, (46 FR 20996), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approved a Minnesota State
Implementation Plan (SIP) revision consisting of a sulfur dioxide control plan and emission limitations contained
in revised operating permits for the Rochester and Twin Cities nonattainment area. USEPA erroneously codified its
approval at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 52.1220(c)(16). Paragraph (c)(16) had already been utilized to codify USEPA's March 4, 1981 (46 FR 15138) approval
of a revision to provide for modification of the Minnesota air quality surveillance network.

 NASA guidance on Contractor Performance Summary (CPS) was adopted in 57 FR 3137, 01/28/92, and amended in 57 FR 60737,
12/22/92. This rule removes CPS guidance because the guidance is burdensome. This rule makes no change to the guidance
on evaluating proposal risk which was also added by 57 FR 3137, 01/28/92, to Subpart 1870.3, Appendix I, to 1870.303

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 4, 1993, an interim rule to amend the NASA FAR Supplement to streamline the major system acquisition process
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for comment (58 FR 58791&hyph;58798). In addition to pointing out errata and inconsistencies that are corrected
in the final rule, the public comments on the interim rule addressed several substantive issues and suggested NASA
consider revising its policy to address them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first of these issues is that the NASA interim rule, by prohibiting the establishment of contractual requirements
for subsequent phase proposals, may not provide a mechanism to ensure that the contractors in the initial phase of
the procurement complete their efforts and submit proposals for the subsequent phase in a timely and responsive manner.
The comment suggests that, absent the appropriate leverage, contractors could ``game'' the system to gain a competitive
advantage in the down-selection by delaying proposal submission until their designs matured. The comment recommends
that NASA revise its interim rule to ensure the integrity of the process in this area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the comment correctly cites the NASA prohibition against establishing a contract requirement for subsequent
phase proposals, it apparently misunderstands the NASA policy relative to requesting these proposals and ensuring
their timely submittal. As stated in the interim rule, NASA will request proposals for the subsequent phase of the
procurement from the preceding phase contractors (and any outside source that wishes to submit one) at a defined point
during initial phase performance. This request will advise offerors that proposals will be required by a date certain
and that FAR 52.215&hyph;10, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Proposals, applies. This clause
states that any proposal received after the required submission date will not be considered unless one of the specified
exceptions applies. Consequently, if an initial phase contractor does not submit a proposal by the due date and one
of the exceptions in FAR 52.215&hyph;10 does not apply, they forfeit the opportunity to continue in the competition,
and the procurement will proceed without them. NASA believes that this procedure best suits our goals. We are not interested
in requiring a contractor to submit a proposal if that offeror believes its design approach is not competitive. To
do so would be to force a contractor to expend its resources in pursuit of a contract it has no reasonable expectation
of winning, and the resultant ``competition'' could fairly be labeled a sham. Moreover, we expect contractors in
progressive competition procurements to be committed to satisfying our requirements, and to work diligently toward
providing, at the times specified, the products required for the Government's down-selection decisions. It is not
in their interests to do otherwise. The hypothetical instance described in the public comment of a contractor attempting
to ``game'' the system is effectively precluded by the proposal request procedures described above that would eliminate
them from consideration for subsequent phase awards. No revision to our policy is necessary in this area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second public comment requested clarification of the interim rule to address the issue of proposals submitted for
subsequent phases by sources other than the preceding phase contractors and how they would be treated. By way of example,
the comment questioned whether such outside offerors have the right to protest and debriefing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NASA's progressive competitions are full and open competitions throughout the process. All proposals received,
whether from preceding phase contractors or from outside sources, are considered to be solicited and are given full,
unbiased evaluation under NASA SEB procedures. Since outside offerors enjoy the same standing as the preceding phase
contractors, they have the full rights of any offeror on a NASA procurement, including protest and debriefing. To
accord a diminished set of rights to outside offerors would compromise both the commitment to full and open competition
and the agency's source selection process. Even-handed treatment of all offerors is inherent in both our SEB procedures
and the progressive competition policy, and no revision to our policy is necessary to address the public comment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A third public comment requested further definition of the proposal preparation information that will be provided
to offerors who are not preceding phase contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASA interim rule specifies that such information includes the ``previously issued solicitation; the preceding
phase contracts; the preceding phase system performance and design requirements; all proposal preparation instructions;
and evaluation factors, subfactors and elements''. NASA considers this list to be adequately inclusive for a policy
that must address a wide range of programs. Individual programs will have unique information that will be provided
to outside offerors, but these requirements cannot be anticipated at this time. No revision to our policy is necessary
in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last substantive public comment recommended clarification of the procedure in 1834.005&hyph;1(d)(7) by which
subsequent phase offerors other than initial phase contractors are eliminated from the competition if their proposals
do not demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the preceding phase contracts. The comment suggested that
this process be explicitly linked to the competitive range standard in FAR 15.609(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elimination of an offeror is technically a competitive range determination. Accordingly, we believe that explicit
linkage of 1834.005&hyph;1(d)(7) and FAR 15.609(b) is unnecessary. Furthermore, NASA source selection procedures
in 1815.613&hyph;71(b) already discuss elimination of offerors with more precision than a cross reference to the
FAR would provide. Under these procedures, offerors may be eliminated at several points during the selection process,
the first of which is through an initial identification of unacceptable proposals. This process occurs during initial
review, before the proposal is formally scored or evaluated against the evaluation factors. At this time, if a proposal's
deficiencies are clearly of such a magnitude that it warrants discontinuance of the evaluation, NASA eliminates
that proposals from further consideration. The procedures of 1834.005&hyph;1(d)(7) cited in the public comment
relate to this process. For those proposals still under consideration, NASA performs a full evaluation against the
evaluation factors and makes a competitive range determination based on that evaluation. These long-standing procedures
provide a clear description of the NASA evaluation process. Adoption of the public comment recommendation would
only cloud this description, and no change is made to the interim rule in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NASA is adopting as a final rule the text set out in the interim rule with minor changes that have no significant effect
on the substance of the interim rule. First, the interim rule did not specify dates for the two clauses added to the NASA
FAR Supplement, 1852.234&hyph;70 and 1852.234&hyph;71. These clauses are dated November 1993 in this final rule.
Second, the interim rule included a number of references to NASA Management Instruction (NMI) 7102.4, ``Management
of Major System Programs and Projects.'' Several of these references should also have cited the NMI's companion NASA
Handbook (NHB) 7120.5, ``Management of Major System Programs and Projects Handbook''. These NHB references are
included in this final rule. Third, a number of editorial changes are made to correct errata and inconsistencies in
the publishes interim rule.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NASA formal SEB procedures apply to all competitive negotiated procurements of $25 million or more, except for specific
categories of procurements (e.g., NASA Research Announcements) that require their own unique procedures. For actions
under $25 million, the formal procedures are optional. Existing agency regulations on this issue are not clear, and
the NASA FAR Supplement is revised to clarify the applicability of formal SEB procedures. These revisions affect
internal procedures only and have no direct impact on external entities. The revisions are issued as a final rule to
ensure immediate implementation.

crab in Zone 1 for the trawl rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category, which is defined at &sect;675.21(b)(1)(iii)(B)(2), was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established as 110,000 crabs by the final 1994 initial specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with &sect;675.21(c)(1)(i), that the prohibited

In accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(7)(ii), the TAC of pollock for vessels catching pollock for processing by the
offshore component in the AI was established by the final 1994 initial groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February
16, 1994), as 31,272 metric tons (mt). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has determined, in accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(8), that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollock TAC for the offshore component in the AI soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established
a directed fishing allowance of 27,772 mt after determining that 3,500 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed
fishing for other species in the AI. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by operators
of vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the AI, effective from 12 noon A.l.t., March
1, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 24, 1991, the FAA issued a final rule concerning part 157 of the Federal Aviation Regulations that deleted an
impending requirement to provide 90 days advance notice of construction, alteration, activation, and deactivation
of certain temporary airports and heliports located within a specified distance from another airport; revised the
applicability section of part 157 to exclude proposals involving the intermittent use of sites that are not established
airports; and clarified that telephone notice for certain emergency or unreasonable hardship situations be directed
to the appropriate Airports District/Field Office or Regional Office. The final rule revised certain provisions
contained in a previous amendment to this part before the effective date of that amendment. The final rule became effective
on August 30, 1991. The public was invited to submit comments on the final rule by November 21, 1991. Based on the comments
received, the FAA has determined that no further rulemaking action is necessary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On October 4, 1988, the FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (notice No. 88&hyph;15, 53 FR 39062) that addressed
certain safety issues concerning the construction, alteration, activation, and deactivation of airports. On August
27, 1990, the FAA published a final rule (amendment No. 157&hyph;4, 55 FR 34994), based on the proposals contained
in Notice No. 88&hyph;15 and the public comments to that notice. Amendment No. 157&hyph;4: (1) Established a requirement
to provide notice to the Administrator prior to establishing or changing a traffic pattern or traffic pattern altitude;
(2) defined a new term, ``private use of public lands or waters;'' (3) eliminated the term ``personal use'' as an airport
use designation; and (4) revised the applicability section of part 157 regarding notice criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to Amendment No. 157&hyph;4, part 157 notice criteria applied to any proposal to construct, alter, activate,
or deactivate a civil or joint-use (civil/military) airport except for those proposals involving: (1) Certain projects
for which Federal aid had been requested, and (2) a ``temporary'' airport or aircraft landing or takeoff area. The
term ``temporary'' meant that the airport or aircraft landing or takeoff area was intended to be used solely in visual
flight rules (VFR) conditions for less than 30 days, with no more than 10 operations a day. Amendment No.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
157&hyph;4 revised the temporary airports exclusion from the notice requirements of part 157. The amendment provided
that only the following temporary airports and heliports would be excluded from the part 157 notice provisions: (1)
Temporary private use airports for fixed-wing aircraft and ultralight vehicles that are located beyond specified
distances from other airports, and (2) temporary private use heliports and helicopter landing areas that are located
outside a control zone, a residential, business, or industrial area, and beyond specified distances from other airports
and heliports.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
After the publication of Amendment No. 157&hyph;4, and before its original effective date of February 27, 1991, the
FAA received comments from aviation organizations and operators regarding the potential impact of the revised notice
requirement for temporary airports and landing areas. To provide time to review and possibly revise Amendment No.
157&hyph;4, the FAA delayed its effective date until August 30, 1991 (Amendment No. 157&hyph;5, 56 FR 8674, February
28, 1991).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 24, 1991, the FAA published a final rule (Amendment No. 157&hyph;6, 56 FR 33994) that eliminated the impending
requirement to provide 90 days advance notice of construction, alteration, activation, and deactivation of certain
temporary airports and heliports. Amendment No. 157&hyph;6 also revised the applicability section of part 157 to
exclude proposals involving the intermittent use of sites that are not established airports. The ``intermittent
use of a site'' means that the site is used or intended to be used in VFR conditions for no more than three days in any one
week with no more than 10 operations a day. Finally, Amendment No. 157&hyph;6 clarified that telephone notice for
certain emergency or unreasonable hardship situations should be directed to the appropriate FAA Airports District/Field
Office or Regional Office. Amendment No. 157&hyph;6 and Amendment No. 157&hyph;4 (with the revisions noted above)
became effective on August 30, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA invited comments on amendment No. 157&hyph;6. The FAA stated that the request for comments to Amendment No.
157&hyph;6 did not represent a reopening or reconsideration of the proposals in notice No. 88&hyph;15, or of the revisions
resulting from amendment No. 157&hyph;4 that were not revised or otherwise affected by amendment No. 157&hyph;6.
Therefore, issues relating to the notice requirement for a change to, or the establishment of an airport traffic pattern;
the elimination of the term ``personal use'' as an airport use designation; and other changes resulting from amendment
No. 157&hyph;4 will not be specifically addressed in this document.

Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA received eleven comments to amendment No. 157&hyph;6. Eight commenters address changes resulting from amendment
No. 157&hyph;4 that were not revised or affected by amendment No. 157&hyph;6. As discussed above, such changes will
not be discussed in this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter does not believe that there was a need for regulations to require notice of temporary aircraft operations
to and from a landing site that is not intended to be used as a permanent airport or heliport. Amendment No. 157&hyph;6
provides that notice of temporary airports and landing or takeoff areas would be required if the airport will be used
(other than on an intermittent basis) for a period of more than 30 days, or if more than 10 operations will be conducted
a day. The FAA believes that a level of activity in excess of 10 operations a day warrants closer examination for appropriate
consideration of the potential impact to adjacent airspace users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters believe that the 90-day advance notification requirement would cause economic hardship for
certain operators, particularly emergency medical service and other helicopter operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 157.5(b)(1) provides that ``in an emergency involving essential public service, public health, or public
safety or when the delay arising from the 90-day advance notice requirement would result in an unreasonable hardship,
a proponent may provide notice to the appropriate FAA Airport District/Field Office or Regional Office by telephone
or other expeditious means as soon as practicable in lieu of submitting FAA Form 7480&hyph;1.'' The FAA believes that
this provision provides for adequate relief from the 90-day advance notice requirements for emergency medical service
helicopter operations and other similar emergency or unreasonable hardship situations.

One commenter disagrees with the provision that excludes from the applicability section of part 157 a proposal involving
the intermittent use of a site that is not an established airport. The commenter believes that the provision ``lowers
standards'' pertaining to notice of construction, alteration, activation, or deactivation of landing areas. Further,
the commenter believes that the change could provide a ``loop hole'' for operators whose landing intentions are to
rustle cattle, transport drugs, or illegally dispose of chemicals. This provision was promulgated because there
may be a number of reasons for multiple operations to a site with no intent to establish an airport within the meaning
of part 157. For example, medical, firefighting, law enforcement, construction, logging, and agricultural functions
may require repeated flights to and from an accident, incident, construction, or other temporary landing site. Certain
construction, agricultural, and logging functions may not require the continuous use of a site over the course of
the project but would instead involve occasional and infrequent return visits to the site. Prior to Amendment No.
157&hyph;4, proponents who intended to operate to and from a site on an intermittent or sporadic basis for more than
30 days were required to notify the FAA 90 days before conducting such an operation. Such notice would be required even
in a situation involving only two operations to the same site when the return visit is conducted 30 or more days after
the first operation. The FAA believes that the majority of such operations would not require or result in the establishment
of an airport nor constitute an intent to establish an airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the commenter's concern that the intermittent-use exclusion could affect the ability to deter certain
illegal activities, the primary purpose of part 157 is to establish notice requirements for the construction, alteration,
activation, or deactivation of certain airport, heliport, and aircraft landing area proposals. Such notice provides
the FAA with an opportunity to conduct an aeronautical study of an airport proposal to determine the effects of that
proposal on neighboring airports, existing or contemplated traffic patterns at neighboring airports, and existing
airspace environment and projected FAA programs. Further, the FAA studies the effects that existing or proposed
man-made objects and natural objects within the affected area would have on the airport proposal. As such, part 157
is not intended or designed to assist law enforcement agencies or otherwise prevent or deter illegal activity. However,
the FAA agrees with the commenter regarding the general need for reasonable measures to monitor and deter illegal
activities. Accordingly, the FAA cooperates with agencies such as the United States Customs Service, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Defense and other Federal and state agencies in support of their law enforcement
and national security missions.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has determined, after carefully considering the comments submitted in response to amendment No. 157&hyph;6,
that no further rulemaking action is necessary at this time. Amendment No. 157&hyph;6 remains in effect as prescribed
by the July 24, 1991, final rule.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Jet
Route J&hyph;512 from the Kalispell, MT, VOR/DME to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, excluding that airspace within Canada.
This action would enhance traffic flow between the United States and Canada. This action would also amend V&hyph;351
from Kalispell, MT, to the United States/Canadian Border to reduce controller workload. Jet routes and domestic
VOR Federal airways are published in paragraphs 2004 and 6010(a), respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17,
1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993.
The jet route and domestic VOR Federal airway listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Justice (``Department'') is issuing for an additional 30-day comment period a proposed rule governing
the circumstances under which its attorneys may communicate with persons and organizations known to be represented
by counsel in the course of law enforcement investigations and proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule is to impose a comprehensive, clear and uniform set of regulations on the conduct of
government attorneys during criminal and civil investigations and enforcement proceedings. The rule is intended
to ensure that government attorneys adhere to the highest ethical standards, while eliminating the uncertainty
and confusion arising from the variety of interpretations of state rules, some of which have been incorporated by
reference as local court rules in a number of federal district courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule establishes a general prohibition, subject to limited enumerated exceptions, against contacts
with ``represented parties.'' This prohibition derives from the American Bar Association (``ABA'') Code of Professional
Responsibility and its successor, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. The proposed rule generally permits
investigative contacts with represented individuals or organizations who have not yet been named as defendants
in a civil or criminal enforcement proceeding or arrested as part of a criminal proceeding. However, the rule would
not permit contacts with represented persons without the consent of counsel for the purpose of negotiating plea agreements,
settlements or other similar legal arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department intends to issue substantial additions to the United States Attorneys' Manual (``Manual'')
to provide additional direction to Department attorneys when they deal with represented individuals and organizations,
in order to accommodate more fully the principles and purposes underlying the bar rules. Those provisions further
restrict government attorneys when they contact targets of criminal or civil law enforcement investigations who
are known to be represented by counsel, and when they communicate with other represented persons. The intended additions
to the United States Attorneys' Manual are provided for reference as part of this commentary.

I. General Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department issued for notice and comment a proposed rule on the same subject on two previous occasions. See 57 FR
54737 (Nov. 20, 1992) and 58 FR 39976 (July 26, 1993). The Department received many thoughtful comments from members
of the bar, state courts, bar counsel, federal and state prosecutors and others during those comment periods. The
current version of the proposed rule includes substantial revisions based on those comments. Accordingly, the Department
is issuing the rule again for comments to ensure that all the interested parties have an opportunity to comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal reflects the Department's commitment to fostering ethical behavior consistent with the principles
informing DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility and Rule 4.2 of the Model Rules of Professional
Conduct, while setting forth clear and uniform national guidelines upon which federal attorneys can rely in carrying
out their responsibilities to enforce federal laws. The regulations make clear that federal attorneys generally
continue to be subject to state bar ethical rules where they are licensed to practice, except in the limited circumstances
where state ethical rules clearly conflict with lawful federal procedures and practices. With respect to willful
violations of the contacts rules as embodied in the Attorney General's proposed regulations, federal attorneys
would remain subject to state bar disciplinary sanctions. This new proposal is the product of extensive review, comments
and vigorous debate among judges, federal government attorneys, members of the private bar, disciplinary officials,
academics and ethicists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In essence, the proposed regulations would permit federal prosecutors and agents to continue to conduct criminal
and civil investigations in routine fashion against all individuals, whether or not those persons are represented
by counsel. They would allow Department attorneys to continue to make or direct undercover or overt contacts with
individuals and organizations represented by counsel for the purpose of developing factual information up until
the point at which they are arrested or charged with a crime or named as defendants in a civil law enforcement action.
However, the regulations generally would not permit federal prosecutors to attempt to negotiate plea agreements,
settlements or similar arrangements with individuals represented by counsel outside of the presence or without
the consent of their attorneys. These regulations also would preclude, with certain very narrow exceptions, any
contacts with represented parties after an arrest, indictment, or the filing of a complaint on the subject matter
of the representation. The principal exception to these general prohibitions occurs when the defendant voluntarily
and knowingly initiates a contact with the government attorney, in which case the regulations would require the government
attorney to take the matter before a district judge or magistrate judge to obtain approval for the communication or
to obtain the appointment of substitute counsel for the defendant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States Attorneys' Manual will set forth further guidance. The proposed Manual provisions, which are set
out in their entirety at the end of this commentary, prohibit overt approaches by federal attorneys to represented
targets of criminal or civil enforcement proceedings without the consent of counsel, unless certain enumerated
exceptions are met. The Manual also will require that government attorneys receive approval from their supervisors
before communicating with any represented party or represented target. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since early in this century, the rules of professional conduct that govern attorneys have required that lawyers for
one party in a dispute communicate only through an adverse party's lawyer, rather than directly. DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1)
of the ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility provides:

A. During the course of his representation of a client a lawyer shall not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Communicate or cause another to communicate on the subject of the representation with a party he knows to be represented
by a lawyer in that matter unless he has the prior consent of the lawyer representing such other party or is authorized
by law to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 4.2 of the ABA Model Rules states: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a party the lawyer
knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized
by law to do so.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Disciplinary authorities in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia have adopted one of these rules, or a similar
prohibition. Underlying these rules is the recognition that when two parties in a legal proceeding are represented,
it is unfair for an attorney to circumvent opposing counsel and employ superior skills and legal training to take advantage
of the opposing party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, the courts have long recognized that government law enforcement agents must be allowed broad powers,
within constitutional limits, to investigate crime and civil violations of police and regulatory laws. These powers
properly include the authority to conduct undercover operations and to interview witnesses, potential suspects,
targets and even defendants who waive their rights to remain silent. Although the Fifth and Sixth Amendments significantly
restrict contacts with defendants after their initial appearance before a judge or after indictment, these constraints
generally do not apply before a person has been taken into custody or charged in an adversary proceeding. Sound policies
support this substantial power of police to investigate. The general public, victims of crime, and even potential
suspects have a strong interest in vigorous inquiry by law enforcement officers before arrest or the filing of charges.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As long as investigations were treated as within the province of the police alone, the traditional rule forbidding
counsel from directly contacting represented persons did not come into conflict with legitimate law enforcement
activities. In recent years, however, the Department of Justice has encouraged federal prosecutors to play a larger
role in preindictment, prearrest investigations. Some of this increased involvement stems from the wider use of
law enforcement techniques, such as electronic surveillance, which require the preparation of legal filings. Also,
complex white collar and organized crime investigations necessitate more intensive engagement of lawyers, who
present such cases to grand juries. Most important, greater participation of lawyers at the preindictment stage
of law enforcement has been regarded as helpful in assuring that police investigations comply with high legal and
ethical standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This extension of the traditional prosecutor's responsibility has been a salutary development. One by-product,
however, has been uncertainty about whether the traditional professional limitation on attorney contacts with
represented parties should be viewed as a restriction upon prosecutors engaged in investigations and, by extension,
the agents with whom they work. The overwhelming preponderance of federal appellate courts have held that the restriction
on contacts with represented persons does not apply at the preindictment investigation stage. See, e.g.,

, 858 F.2d 834 (2d Cir. 1988). In recent years, state courts and state bar organizations have expressed different views
on the point at which the prohibition on contacts now embodied in DR 7&hyph;104, Model Rule 4.2 and their analogs should
apply to criminal enforcement proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uncertainty about the scope and applicability of DR 7&hyph;104, Rule 4.2 and their state counterparts has directly
affected the investigative activities of agents, including Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement
Administration personnel, who work with prosecutors. An expansive application of these rules in some jurisdictions
may have the effect of blocking preindictment interviews or undercover operations that most courts have held permissible
under federal constitutional and statutory law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This problem is compounded when federal attorneys assigned to the same case are members of different state bars. Under
federal law, a Department attorney must be a member in good standing of a state bar, but he or she need not belong to the
bar in each state in which he or she is practicing for the government. As a result, prosecution teams often comprise
attorneys admitted to different bars. The application of different state disciplinary rules to these individuals
creates uncertainty, confusion and the possibility of unfairness. Indeed, one member of a two-member federal prosecution
team could receive a commendation for effective law enforcement while the other member would be subject to state discipline
for the exact same conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these circumstances, the Department has concluded that a compelling need exists which warrants a uniform
federal rule to reconcile the traditional rule against contacts with a represented person with the obligation of
the Department of Justice to enforce the law vigorously. Indeed, absent a new federal rule, prosecutors have been
forced on occasion to reduce their participation in the investigative phase of law enforcement so as to leave federal
agents unfettered by state disciplinary rules that were never intended to govern police behavior. Such a retreat
from the field by prosecutors serves neither efficiency nor the interest in elevating legal compliance and ethical
standards in all phases of law enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the disciplinary rules themselves invite this type of regulation. Virtually all the states have adopted
rules that include an ``authorized by law'' exception. These proposed regulations are intended to provide legal
authorization in states whose bar rules provide that exception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Department has long maintained, and continues to maintain, that it has the authority to exempt its attorneys
from the application of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and their state counterparts. Furthermore, the Department
maintains that whether, and to what extent, such prohibitions should apply to Department attorneys is a policy question.

O.L.C. 576, 577 (1980). However, in light of the fact that all 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted some
form of a prohibition on contacts with represented parties, and in view of the long history of those rules, the Department
believes that its attorneys should adhere to the principles underlying those rules to the maximum extent possible.
Therefore, even though the Department has the authority to exempt its attorneys from the reach of these rules, the
Department has decided not to implement a wholesale exemption.

Rather, the proposed regulations attempt to reconcile the purposes underlying DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 with effective
law enforcement. Recognizing the importance of the attorney-client relationship and the desirability of an individual
who is represented by counsel being fully advised by counsel before negotiating legal agreements, the regulations
provide that federal attorneys may not negotiate plea bargains, settlement agreements, immunity agreements or
similar arrangements without the participation or consent of the individual's attorney. In this context, the prosecutor's
superior legal training and specialized knowledge could be used to the detriment of the untutored layperson. Thus,
the regulations comport with the principal purpose of DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 by insisting that the individual's
attorney participate in these types of negotiations. At the same time, the regulations would permit direct contacts
at the preindictment, prearrest investigative stage with any individual, whether or not he or she is represented
by counsel, to inquire about the matters under investigation. The regulations are drafted to conform to the approach
of most federal appellate courts that have considered the matter. See, e.g.,

, 485 F.2d 941, 955&hyph;56 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 989 (1974). The Department believes that public
policy and effective law enforcement would not be served if one could exempt himself or herself from lawful, court-sanctioned
investigative techniques simply by retaining an attorney. The Department believes that it is inappropriate to alter
investigative techniques based upon an individual's financial ability to retain counsel before the point at which
a court would appoint counsel for a person not able to afford counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations and the accompanying changes to the United States Attorneys' Manual also would give effect to other
important aspects of the bar rules against contacts with represented parties. For example, the regulations would
preclude federal attorneys from disparaging an individual's counsel or from attempting to gain access to attorney-client
confidences or lawful defense strategy. The guidelines contained in the Manual provisions will also make clear that
once an individual is in a likely adversarial situation with the government and has retained an attorney to represent
him or her with respect to the particular subject matter under investigation, the government attorney must take greater
care before making any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contacts. While the proposed regulations authorize most communications before arrest, the proposed Manual changes
provide that, as a matter of internal policy guidance, federal prosecutors generally should not make overt contacts
with represented targets of investigations. However, the Manual provisions permit overt contacts with a represented
target when initiated by the target; when necessary to prevent death or physical injury; when the relevant investigation
involves ongoing, additional or different crimes from that to which the representation relates; or when a United
States Attorney or an Assistant Attorney General expressly concludes, under all of the circumstances, that the contact
is needed for effective law enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed regulations and Manual provisions also address when a government attorney may communicate
with an employee, officer or director of a represented corporation or organization without the consent of counsel.
The regulations generally prohibit a government attorney from communicating with a current, high-level employee
of a represented organization who participates as a ``decision maker in the determination of the organization's
legal position in the proceeding or investigation of the subject matter'' and the organization has been named as a
defendant in a criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. The Manual provisions further generally prohibit contacts
with controlling individuals of organizations that have not yet been named as defendants but are targets of federal
criminal or civil law enforcement investigations without the consent of counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations recognize that state courts and disciplinary bodies continue to play the primary role in
regulating the conduct of all attorneys, including those who work for the federal government. Further, Department
of Justice attorneys continue to be subject to state bar ethical rules except to the limited extent those rules conflict
with lawful federal procedures and practices. As noted above, however, because of the expanded participation of
federal prosecutors in preindictment investigations, DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 have inevitably affected
and circumscribed the power of federal law enforcement officials to carry out their legally mandated responsibilities.
State courts and disciplinary committees are not the appropriate final arbiters of the scope of federal policing.
The Department of Justice must assume this role, subject to the Constitution and the laws of the United States. The
new regulations would not supplant state discipline. Rather, the regulations would provide that attorneys who comply
with the new federal rule will be shielded from inconsistent state disciplinary rules. On the other hand, attorneys
who willfully violate the new regulations would continue to be subject to the full measure of state disciplinary jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is confident that, taken together, the proposed regulations, Manual amendments and this supplemental
information will promote the public interest in effective law enforcement conforming to the highest standards of
legal ethics.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments received following the second publication of the earlier proposal were similar in many respects to those
received in the first round of comments. As of September 19, 1993, the Department received 219 written comments. Of
those, 159 comments were received from Department of Justice employees. Of those, 144, mostly from federal prosecutors
from around the country, supported promulgation of the earlier proposal; 1 opposed the rule; and 14 others provided
miscellaneous comments. The Department also received 21 comments from federal officials outside the Department,
18 of whom supported the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received 39 comments from individuals and organizations outside of the federal government. These
writers included private attorneys, public defenders, state court judges, bar associations, disciplinary officials
and others. Twenty-eight writers in that group expressed opposition to the rule while 3 supported the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those writing in support of the earlier proposal generally emphasized three major points. First, they stated that
a clear rule governing communications by federal attorneys with represented individuals was critical to the vigorous
enforcement of federal law. Several writers stated that the lack of clarity on the matter created by a variety of court
and bar association opinions has had a chilling effect on federal enforcement efforts. They stated that some federal
prosecutors fearful of the uncertain state of the law and unwilling to risk their licenses to practice law have decided
not to engage in routine discussions with represented individuals. Second, several writers described the practice
of some attorneys to claim representation of all the employees of a corporate client. They argued that this practice,
along with the uncertainty of the state of the disciplinary rules, often makes it exceedingly difficult to investigate
wrongdoing by corporations or other organizations. Third, several supporters of the previous proposal stated that
they did not believe that it was the intention of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 to apply to criminal investigations.
Furthermore, they argued that if the prohibitions in those rules apply to all federal criminal and civil investigations
the result will be twofold: (1) Federal attorneys will be forced to reverse the trend of the last 20 years and become
less involved in investigations; and (2) federal agents will stop consulting with federal attorneys during investigations.
Both of these trends will result in less effective law enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received several comments critical of the earlier proposal. Those criticisms fall generally in four
categories. First, several individuals stated that they believed the proposal would exempt Department attorneys
from ethical requirements that apply to all other attorneys, thus creating a double standard. Furthermore, they
argued that the proposal improperly equated constitutional minimums with ethical conduct. Second, several writers
argued that the Attorney General did not have the authority to promulgate such a regulation. They argued that the proposal
unfairly impinged on the traditional right of state supreme courts to monitor and discipline attorneys admitted
to practice before them. They also questioned whether the drafters of the ``authorized by law'' exceptions could
have intended that the Attorney General would be empowered to release Department attorneys from the obligations
of the rules simply by issuing a regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, several people argued that the proposed regulation was not necessary for the vigorous enforcement of the law.
And fourth, several writers commented on various aspects of the proposal itself. The most common objection was to
the ``controlling individual'' test that the proposal used to determine whether communications with a particular
employee of a represented corporation would be permissible. They argued that the test was much too narrow and would
only apply to a corporation's general counsel and a small handful of very senior executives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has reviewed, analyzed and carefully considered all the comments it received and has made substantial
revisions to its earlier proposal based on these comments. The Department believes the current proposal, in combination
with the proposed additions to the United States Attorneys' Manual, appropriately addresses the concerns of the
commenters critical of the earlier proposal, while preserving the Department's ability to enforce federal laws.
Due to the significant nature of the changes made, the Department determined that an additional comment period is
appropriate.

III. Section-by-Section Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 77.1&blank;Purpose and Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes no material changes from the rule published earlier. It does, however, include additional
discussion regarding the purpose of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General's authority to establish standards of conduct for Department of Justice attorneys derives
from two distinct sources: Section 301 of title 5, United States Code, and title 28 of the United States Code, which,
through a variety of provisions, authorizes the Attorney General and the Department of Justice to enforce federal
law. Section 301 states that ``[t]he head of an Executive department or military department may prescribe regulations
for the government of his department, the conduct of its employees, [and] the distribution and performance of its
business.'' Authority to promulgate this rule also is implicit in the Attorney General's statutory power to ``supervise
all litigation'' to which the United States is a party and to direct United States Attorneys and other subordinate
attorneys in the ``discharge of their respective duties.'' 28 U.S.C. 519. Other specific statutory references are
indicated in the text of the rule.

Section 77.2&blank;Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section is substantially similar to the definitional section of the previous proposal. Two changes, however,
are worthy of attention: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
``Attorney for the Government'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, the definition of ``attorney for the government'' has been refined explicitly to exclude from the definition
those law enforcement agents employed by the Department of Justice who are also members of state bars, if they are employed
as, and are performing the function of, agents rather than attorneys. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement
Agency and other investigative agencies have long recruited individuals with advanced degrees_including, for
example, engineering, business and law degrees_to serve as agents. The Department strongly encourages the recruitment
of educated and specially trained individuals for positions as agents. An agent's bar membership should not adversely
affect his or her ability to conduct comprehensive investigations and otherwise to fulfill his or her law enforcement
functions. Therefore, the proposed rule specifically exempts attorney-agents from its scope if they are employed
by the government as investigative agents and not as attorneys.

``Undercover Investigation'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the section now includes a definition of the term ``undercover investigation.'' Under this definition,
the hallmark of an ``undercover operation'' is an investigation in which an individual ``whose identity as an official
of the government or a person acting at the behest thereof is concealed or is intended to be concealed.'' This definition
is intended to be read broadly to include virtually every type of law enforcement investigation in which the identity
of a government employee, or the fact that an individual is cooperating with the government, is concealed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section differs significantly from the corresponding section in the earlier proposal in order more closely
to follow the language in DR 7&hyph;104(a)(1) and Rule 4.2, which establish general prohibitions against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with a represented party, and to differentiate between those individuals who are represented by counsel
and have become a party to a proceeding, and those represented individuals who are not parties to any relevant proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual is considered to be a ``represented party'' under these rules if: (1) The person is represented by counsel;
(2) the representation is current and concerns the subject matter in question; and (3) the person has either been arrested
or charged in a federal criminal case or is a defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding concerning the subject
matter of the representation. If the person is currently represented in fact regarding the subject matter in question,
but has not been charged or arrested, that person is considered a ``represented person.'' Thus, witnesses, suspects
and targets of investigations who have not been indicted or arrested are considered represented persons under this
rule and in the United States Attorneys' Manual guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 77.5 of this rule generally prohibits government attorneys from initiating 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with represented parties, but does not prohibit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with represented persons. (However, &sect;&sect;77.8 and 77.9 prohibit some contacts with represented
persons as well.) This distinction between represented parties and represented persons is consistent with the rulings
of the vast majority of federal courts to consider the issue.

This section is substantially similar to the corresponding section in the earlier proposal. The section has been
revised slightly to make clear that although the proposed rule does not supersede the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, this limitation does not extend to other rules regarding procedure in

bar rules, are not included in this limitation.

Section 77.5&blank;General Rule for Civil and Criminal Enforcement; Represented Parties

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

This section, as well as sections 77.6 through 77.9, differs substantially from corresponding sections contained
in the earlier proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section closely tracks the language of DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Rule 4.2 and applies similar prohibitions to
attorneys for the government. The section prohibits an attorney for the government from communicating with a represented
party, as defined in &sect;77.3, about the subject matter of the representation without the consent of that individual's
attorney. The prohibition applies, however, only if the attorney for the government knows that the represented party
is, in fact, represented by counsel. Therefore, communications by an attorney for the government with a represented
party will not violate this rule if the attorney for the government is unaware of the fact of representation.

This section also prohibits an attorney for the government from causing another individual to communicate with a
represented party. Accordingly, a government investigator acting at the attorney's direction and control may not
do what the attorney himself or herself is prohibited from doing. Conversely, a government attorney will not be personally
responsible for the actions of agents in communicating with represented persons unless, in doing so, the agents were
acting as the attorney's ``alter ego.''

an inappropriate communication takes place, regardless of whether or not the communication results in eliciting

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section describes the circumstances under which Department attorneys may communicate, or cause others to communicate,
with a represented party who the Department attorney knows is represented concerning the subject matter of the representation
without first obtaining the consent of the represented party's counsel. The exceptions enumerated in this section
are similar to, but not identical with, the exceptions enumerated in &sect;77.7 of the earlier proposal.

Paragraph (a): Determination if Representation Exists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This exception recognizes the fact that there is no reason to prohibit a limited inquiry about whether an individual
is, in fact, represented by counsel regarding the relevant subject matter. Such an inquiry does not involve the kind
of communication about which courts have expressed concern and has little potential for undermining the attorney-client
relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There may be uncertainty about the existence of representation with respect to whether it has been established, whether
it may have been terminated, and whether a particular subject falls within the scope of the representation. The first
issue may arise when a judicial or other appearance has not occurred, but the government attorney has some information
suggesting that the person may be represented. It may also arise when an attorney purports to represent a group of persons,
such as all the employees of a corporation. Uncertainty about the termination of the representation may arise when
substantial time has passed since it was made known that the person was represented by counsel or when the attorney
for the government has reason to believe that the representation has ceased. It is unlikely, however, that such uncertainty
will arise when there are pending judicial proceedings, since the court must approve termination of representation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When inquiring about the status of representation, government attorneys and agents generally must refrain from
stating whether it is necessary or desirable to be represented by counsel. After the right to counsel has attached,
a statement or implication suggesting that counsel is not providing proper or effective representation could violate
the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. See

This exception is not intended to and does not create a duty on the part of the attorney for the government to inquire
about the status of representation. However, if the attorney for the government has any reason to believe that the
individual is represented by counsel with regard to the relevant subject matter, he or she should, as a matter of course,
make the appropriate inquiries before engaging in substantive discussions with the individual.

and may have counsel present if desired during the proceeding (except, of course, while testifying before a grand

Paragraph (c): Initiation of Communication by Represented Party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the concerns most frequently raised by Department attorneys during the comment period on the previous proposal
was the lack of clarity under current law regarding the propriety of communicating with a represented party, in the
absence of that party's counsel, when the communication is initiated by the party. A defendant may wish to communicate
with the government outside the presence of counsel for many valid reasons. Department attorneys repeatedly cited
the situation in which a defendant wants to cooperate with the government but does not want his or her attorney to know
for fear that the attorney will disclose the defendant's intentions to others. This situation typically arises when
the defendant questions the loyalty of his or her attorney, who is being paid by another individual involved in a criminal
enterprise. The same problem may arise when a single attorney represents multiple parties who are part of the same
criminal enterprise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the desire of a defendant or arrestee to speak with the attorney for the government outside the presence of his
or her counsel is ``voluntary, knowing and informed,'' there is no valid reason to prohibit the government from engaging
in such communications. In fact, the Department believes that it would be a dereliction of its obligation to enforce
vigorously federal law if it promulgated a rule that would prohibit such communications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is well established that an individual who is entitled to counsel under the Fifth Amendment or the Sixth Amendment
may waive that right and choose to communicate with the government outside the presence of his or her attorney, ``provided
the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.''

that are allowed by the Constitution by a disciplinary rule that was intended to protect that individual in the first
place. Neither common sense nor the principles underlying DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 require such a result.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph amends the previous proposal by adding procedural protections designed to ensure that such waivers
are in fact voluntary, knowing, and informed. After a represented individual has been arrested or charged in a criminal
proceeding or is named as a defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding, the proposed rule requires that several
steps be taken before any substantive discussions take place. First, the government attorney must inform the individual
of his or her right to speak through his or her attorney and to have that attorney present for any communications with
the government attorney. Second, the represented party must waive his or her right to counsel in such a way as to indicate
that the waiver is voluntary, knowing and informed. If at all possible, the attorney for the government should obtain
a signed written waiver. Third, the attorney for the government must bring the matter before the appropriate district
court judge, magistrate or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction. The court should be asked for a determination:
That the waiver satisfies the provisions of this rule; or that substitute counsel is in place and that counsel consents
to the communication; or, in the alternative, that it is appropriate for the court to appoint counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule does not, however, require that the waiver take place before the judge or magistrate. In exceptional circumstances,
it may be impractical or unsafe to bring the defendant before a judge or magistrate to secure the waiver. In those cases,
the tribunal must determine in advance of substantive discussions, based on the evidence before it, whether the waiver
was made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the initiation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contacts by represented parties frequently occurs in the context of the ``fearful defendant'' whose attorney has
been chosen by a third party, often an individual above the defendant in the criminal hierarchy. Such a defendant may
wish to cooperate with the government but may fear that his life or safety will be endangered if his attorney learns
of the cooperation. Although the need for a mechanism by which a represented party can initiate contacts with the government
is particularly acute in this context, paragraph (c) is not limited to this setting. Rather, the proper inquiry is
whether the represented party's waiver of the right to counsel is voluntary, knowing, and informed_not whether the
represented party has established some overriding justification for his or her decision.

Paragraph (d): Waivers at the Time of Arrest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c) of this section provides the general rule regarding how a represented party may waive any protections
otherwise provided under this regulation. This paragraph provides for a more specific rule dealing with a waiver
at the time of arrest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph provides that a government attorney may communicate directly with a represented party without the
consent of that party's counsel at the time of his or her arrest if the represented party has been fully informed of his
or her Constitutional rights at that time and has waived them. The government attorney need not comply with any of the
additional requirements of paragraph (c) in such a situation. However, it is generally prudent to obtain a written
waiver at the time of arrest if possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exception is intended to preserve the ability of government attorneys to interview individuals immediately
following arrest as an effective and important law enforcement tool. A substantial body of law has developed regarding
the post-arrest waiver of various Constitutional rights. The Department believes that the Constitutional requirements
identified in that decisional law adequately protect represented individuals following arrest. Furthermore,
the effectiveness of post-arrest interviews would be significantly curtailed if the procedural requirements of
paragraph (c) applied. Accordingly, this paragraph is intended to preserve this investigative tool without adding
any additional procedural requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with a represented party if the contacts involve the investigation of offenses as to which the represented
party has neither been arrested nor charged in a criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. The Department believes
this approach is wholly consistent with DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and the cases interpreting them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this section provides that communications may be made in the course of investigations of additional,
different or ongoing criminal or unlawful activity, even though the individual is represented by counsel with respect
to conduct for which he or she has already been arrested or charged. Such additional criminal or unlawful conduct is
typically one of three varieties: (1) Conduct that is separate from the original wrongful conduct; (2) crimes that
are intended to impede the trial of the charged crime or unlawful conduct, such as subornation of perjury, obstruction
of justice, jury tampering, or murder, assault, or intimidation of witnesses; and (3) conduct that is a continuation
of the charged crime, such as a conspiracy or scheme to defraud that continues past the time of indictment. The new or
additional criminal or wrongful activity may have occurred in the past or may be ongoing at the time of the investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By definition, communications pursuant to this exception will take place when the represented party is the subject
of pending criminal or civil enforcement charges for which he or she is represented by counsel. Government attorneys
must take extreme care to avoid violating the Sixth Amendment right to counsel whenever they invoke this exception
in the criminal context. In particular, care must be taken to avoid the deliberate elicitation of incriminating information
regarding any pending criminal charges.

] prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination''). Paragraph (f)
recognizes an analogous exception to the general prohibition against communications with represented parties
in the absence of their counsel. It is the Department's intention that this exception be invoked only in rare circumstances
and only for the purpose of protecting human life or safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exception has three requirements: (1) The attorney for the government must have a good faith belief that the safety
or life of any person is threatened; (2) the purpose of the communication must be to obtain information to protect against
the risk of injury or death; and (3) the attorney for the government must, in good faith, believe that the communication
is reasonably necessary to protect against such risk. These requirements are imposed to ensure that the exception
is invoked only to protect human life or safety, and not as a routine matter in violent crime prosecutions. For example,
the fact that potentially dangerous firearms have not been recovered would not in and of itself be sufficient under
ordinary circumstances to constitute a threat to safety under this exception. Furthermore, the communication must
be for the purpose of protecting human life or safety, and may not be designed to elicit testimonial evidence. However,
information thus obtained may be used for any purpose consistent with Constitutional limitations.

law. These communications are subject, however, to the restrictions set forth in &sect;&sect;77.8 and 77.9. Furthermore,
proposed changes to the United States Attorneys' Manual included in this commentary will provide additional guidance
to Department attorneys in such situations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section prohibits government attorneys from initiating or engaging in negotiations of certain specified legal
agreements with any individual who the government attorney knows is represented by counsel, without the consent
of that individual's counsel. Even when substantive discussions with a represented party or represented person
are permissible under these regulations, it ordinarily would be improper for a government attorney to initiate or
negotiate a plea agreement, settlement, immunity agreement or any other disposition of a claim or charge in the absence
of the individual's counsel. The one exception to this prohibition occurs when the communication is initiated by
the represented person or represented party and the procedural safeguards provided for in &sect;77.6(c) are satisfied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that this section is vitally important for the preservation of the attorney-client relationship.
One of the primary purposes informing Rule 4.2 and DR 7&hyph;104 is that an individual represented by counsel should
be protected from overreaching by an attorney for an adversary. The Department believes the risk of such overreaching
is greatest during negotiations over plea agreements, settlements and other key legal agreements. The training,
experience and knowledge of the law possessed by an attorney is particularly valuable in such situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prohibition contained in this section includes all discussions of the terms of a particular plea agreement, settlement
agreement or other agreement covered by the section. However, this section does not prohibit an attorney for the government
from responding to questions regarding the nature of such agreements, potential charges, potential penalties or
other subjects related to such agreements during an otherwise permissible discussion. Nevertheless, an attorney
for the government should take care in such situations not to go beyond providing information on these and similar
subjects and should generally refer the represented person to his or her counsel for further discussion of these issues.
The government attorney should also make it clear that he or she will not negotiate any agreement with respect to the
disposition of criminal charges, civil claims or potential charges or claims or immunity without the presence or
consent of counsel.

DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Rule 4.2 protect a represented party's right, if he or she so chooses, to communicate with
his or her adversary only through counsel. The rules do not compel one to make that choice, and the represented party
may elect to speak directly with the government despite his or her attorney's advice not to do so. As a further protective
measure, federal courts have recognized that it is improper for an attorney for the government to disparage counsel
for the represented party or otherwise to seek to disrupt the relationship between that party and his attorney. See,

, 599 F.2d 730, 740 (5th Cir. 1979); id. at 740&hyph;41 (Godbold, J., specially concurring). This paragraph codifies
those basic principles by prohibiting communications that: (1) Attempt to elicit information regarding lawful
defense strategies; (2) disparage the represented party's counsel; or (3) otherwise disrupt the attorney-client
relationship. These prohibitions apply in every phase of criminal and civil enforcement investigations and proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the paragraph also accommodates an important exception to this prohibition. Courts have held that a government
attorney may not permit legal proceedings to go forward if he or she is aware of a conflict of interest between a represented
party and his or her lawyer. See

, 786 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 1986). Under these circumstances, the attorney for the government ordinarily should move
to disqualify the lawyer involved, if legal proceedings have already commenced. If it is not feasible to move for disqualification
or otherwise challenge the representation, this paragraph allows an attorney for the government to communicate
with the represented individual for the limited purpose of apprising the represented individual of the perceived
conflict. However, any substantive discussion of the subject matter of the representation is permissible only insofar
as it is authorized by some other provision of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that this provision is used only in rare circumstances, the rule would require prior authorization
for such communications from the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General,
an Assistant Attorney General or a United States Attorney. The authorization should be in writing if at all possible.
Furthermore, before providing approval, the authorizing officer must find: (1) A substantial likelihood of a conflict;
and (2) that it is not feasible to obtain a court order on the matter.

Paragraph (b): Attorney-Client Meetings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attendance of an undercover agent or a cooperating witness at lawful meetings of an individual and his or her attorneys
is ordinarily an improper intrusion into the attorney-client relationship. The courts have recognized, however,
that such attendance occasionally will be required when the operative is invited to participate and his or her refusal
to do so would effectively reveal his or her connection to the government. See, e.g.,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attendance at such meetings, however, intrudes into the attorney-client relationship and impairs the right of the
defendant to a fair trial. Accordingly, this section provides that undercover agents or cooperating witnesses may
participate in such meetings, but only when requested to do so by the defense and when reasonably necessary to protect
their safety or life, or the confidentiality of an undercover operation. See Weatherford, 429 U.S. at 557 (informant
went to meeting ``not to spy, but because he was asked and because the State was interested in retaining his undercover
services on other matters and it was therefore necessary to avoid raising the suspicion that he was in fact the informant
whose existence [the defendant and his counsel] already suspected''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, even when an undercover operative's attendance at such a meeting is authorized to protect his or her cover
and safety, any information acquired regarding lawful defense strategy or trial preparation may not be communicated
to government attorneys or otherwise used to the substantial detriment of the represented party. See Weatherford,
429 U.S. at 558; Ginsberg, 758 F.2d at 833; Mastroianni, 749 F.2d at 906. As a safeguard, this rule provides that such
information should not be communicated to the attorneys for the government or law enforcement agents who are participating
in the trial of the pending criminal charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When there is reasonable cause to believe that the purpose of the meeting is not the lawful defense of the underlying
charges, but the commission of a new or additional crime (such as bribery of a witness or subordination of perjury),
attendance by informants or undercover agents at attorney-client meetings is permissible pursuant to &sect;77.6(e).
The belief, however, must be based on reasonable cause, not mere suspicion or conjecture. See Mastroianni, 749 F.2d
at 906. Furthermore, the prohibition against communication of lawful defense strategy to the prosecution should
be observed if, in fact, such strategy is imparted to the informant or agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government attorneys should give serious consideration to the extreme sensitivity of permitting agent and informant
attendance at defense meetings. Agents and informants should be instructed to avoid participating in such meetings,
and to minimize their participation when attendance is required, if it is possible to do so without arousing suspicion.
Agents or witnesses who attend defense meetings should also be instructed to avoid taking any role in the shaping of
defense strategy or trial preparations. Finally, agents and informants should be instructed to avoid imparting
defense strategy or trial preparation information to any other law enforcement officials if reasonably feasible
to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this restriction applies only to law enforcement officials and cooperating witnesses who are acting as
``agents for the government'' at the time of the communication. If one of several co-defendants who attended an attorney-client
defense strategy meeting later testifies for the government at trial, no violation will have occurred as long as the
co-defendant was not a government agent at the time of the meeting.

Section 77.10&blank;Organizations and Employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section is similar in structure to &sect;77.13 of the previously published proposal. However, it includes several
substantive changes based on comments received during earlier comment periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue addressed by this section_when should a communication with an employee or member of a represented organization
be considered a communication with the organization itself_is one of the most difficult issues addressed by these
regulations. It was also perhaps the most commented upon provision during the comment period. Several federal prosecutors
commented that they regularly encounter attorneys who assert that they represent every individual in a large corporation
or organization. Others stated that these blanket claims of representation extend to all the former employees as
well. These prosecutors argued for a bright line rule to prevent such abuse and generally commented favorably on the
earlier proposal. Others argued that the earlier proposal was too narrow in scope and would deprive corporations
and other organizations of the effective assistance of counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that this section, and particularly the definition of ``controlling individual'' in &sect;77.10(a),
strikes an appropriate balance, one that ensures government attorneys the ability to enforce federal law, while
preserving the opportunity for corporations and other organizations to secure effective assistance of counsel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a): Communications With Current Employees; Organizational Representation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph states that a communication with a current employee of an organizational party or person should be
treated as a communication with the organization for purposes of this part only if the employee is a controlling individual.
If a communication with a current employee is considered to be a communication with a represented organization under
these rules (that is, if the communication is with a controlling individual), then that communication is subject
to the same limitations that would apply if the communication were directly with the represented organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accord with the basic structure of this part, which distinguishes between represented parties and represented
persons, this paragraph effectively provides that when an organization is a represented party, an attorney for the
government shall not communicate, or cause another to communicate (subject to the exceptions enumerated in &sect;77.6),
with any controlling individual of the organization without the consent of the organization's attorney. In contrast,
when an organization qualifies as a represented person, an attorney for the government may communicate, or cause
another to communicate, with any controlling individual if the communication does not involve negotiations of a
plea agreement, settlement, statutory or non-statutory immunity agreement, or other disposition of actual or potential
criminal charges or civil enforcement claims, or sentences or penalties, as prohibited by &sect;77.8, and if the
communication does not violate the provisions of &sect;77.9.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``controlling individual'' is intended to encompass those individuals who typically are part
of the organization's control group. A controlling individual under this definition must: (1) Be a current employee
or member of the organization; (2) hold a high level position with the organization; (3) participate ``as a decision
maker in the determination of the organization's legal position in the proceeding or investigation of the subject
matter''; and (4) be known by the government to be engaged in such activities. This definition attempts to identify
those limited number of individuals affiliated with the organization who actually are involved in determining the
organization's position with regard to the legal proceeding or investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 are intended to protect the attorney-client relationship from unnecessary interference
and to protect represented parties from overreaching by opposing counsel. Communications with those high-level
individuals affiliated with or employed by an organization who are responsible for employing and directing the organization's
counsel and for determining legal positions taken by the organization are the type of communications prohibited
by DR 7&hyph;104. Accordingly, this paragraph defines ``controlling individual'' consistent with the principles
underlying the disciplinary rules on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of all the issues pertaining to 7&hyph;104(A)(1), the issue of organizational representation has engendered the
greatest confusion and disagreement among the lower federal courts. Courts considering the question have applied
a variety of modes of analysis, either singly or in combination. The Department believes the best approach is that
adopted by those courts that have attempted to identify an organization's ``control group.'' See, e.g.,

contacts with corporate defendant's ``control group,'' defined as ``those top management persons who had the responsibility
of making final decisions and those employees whose advisory roles to top management are such that a decision would
not normally be made without those persons' advice or opinion or whose opinions in fact form the basis of any final decision'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the ``control group'' approach most accurately reflects the values underlying DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1)
and Rule 4.2. This approach properly seeks to identify those employees who exercise such sufficient authority within
the organization that communications with them should be regarded as communications with the organization itself.
The Department also believes that the alternative approaches would impose unacceptable constraints on federal
law enforcement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

This paragraph authorizes communications with former employees of represented organizations. Because former
employees do not direct the affairs of the organization and therefore cannot be considered members of the ``control
group'' or any other controlling entity of an organization, communications with them are not considered communications
with the organization for purposes of the proposed rule. This reasoning is consistent with the conclusion of the majority
of federal courts that have held that DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) does not bar communications with former employees of a represented
corporate party. See, e.g.,

Paragraph (c): Communications With Former or Current Employees; Individual Representation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This paragraph provides that if a former or current employee or a member of an organization retains his or her own counsel,
the government shall provide the same protection to him or her that would be provided under this part to any other represented
person or represented party. Communications with that individual are subject to the limitations set forth in this
part. Although this section provides the general rule for such communications, paragraph (d) addresses the specific
situation in which a controlling individual of a represented organization retains separate counsel.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This paragraph also provides that the government will not accept, for purposes of this rule, blanket claims by counsel
that he or she represents all or a large number of employees of the organization. It is important to note that this provision
is only relevant when the attorney for the government would be prohibited by some other provision of this part from
contacting an individual falling under the broad claims of representation under question. For example, an attorney
for the government may contact a low-level employee of a corporation, without consent of that employee's counsel
or the corporation's counsel, regarding a matter for which the corporation has already been indicted as part of an
undercover or overt factual investigation, if that individual has not been arrested or named as a defendant in a criminal
or civil law enforcement proceeding. Therefore, the fact that an attorney has stated that he or she represents that
individual will have no bearing on whether the communication is proper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if a particular communication with an individual employee included in such a claim of representation would
be improper under these regulations if he or she were in fact represented by counsel (for example, communications
to negotiate a plea agreement), then this paragraph provides that a government attorney must first inquire whether
the employee is in fact represented before undertaking substantive communications with the employee. As part of
this inquiry, the government attorney is not required to disclose to the employee the fact that counsel has asserted
that he or she represents the employee. If the employee indicates that he or she is not represented by counsel, it is
proper for the government attorney to treat the employee as unrepresented. If the employee indicates that he or she
is represented by counsel with regard to the relevant subject matter, the attorney for the government shall treat
that employee as a represented person or represented party, and any further communications with that individual
shall be governed by this part.

Paragraph (d): Communications With Separately Represented Controlling Individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This paragraph ensures that communications with a controlling individual of an organization that qualifies as a
represented party are subject to basically the same limitations, regardless of whether the controlling individual
has retained separate counsel on the same subject matter. Thus, this paragraph only applies in the circumstances
in which a controlling individual of a represented organizational party retains separate counsel. In such circumstances,
a government attorney may not communicate with the controlling individual without the consent of that individual's
separate counsel unless the communication satisfies one of the exceptions contained in &sect;&sect;77.6 or 77.9
of this part. The paragraph also allows such communications if the individual does not qualify as a represented party,
initiates the communication, and waives the presence of counsel. Thus, the same rules apply to contacts with controlling
individuals of represented organizational parties who retain separate counsel as apply to controlling individuals
of represented organizational parties who are not separately represented.

This paragraph addresses a relatively narrow circumstance: when a controlling individual who is not individually
represented by counsel initiates a communication with the government outside the presence of counsel for the organization.
An attorney for the government may participate in such communications if: (1) The controlling individual indicates
that he or she is speaking exclusively in his or her personal capacity and not as a representative of the organizational
party; and (2) he or she indicates that the waiver of counsel is voluntary, knowing and informed and, if willing, signs
a statement to that effect. The fact that the controlling individual indicates that he or she is speaking in his or her
personal capacity does not mean, however, that incriminating testimony received from the controlling individual
cannot be used against the represented organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the controlling individual is also a named defendant in a civil enforcement proceeding or has been arrested or charged
in a criminal action, the requirements set forth in &sect;77.6(c) must be satisfied before any substantive communications
are made.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In order to ensure consistency and uniformity in the interpretation of the proposed rule, this paragraph provides
that the Attorney General shall have exclusive authority to enforce these regulations. Thus, neither state courts
nor state disciplinary boards may impose sanctions on a Department attorney for violations of this rule or state or
local rules governing communications with represented parties except as provided in &sect;77.12. This paragraph
further provides the framework for investigating allegations that a Department attorney has violated these regulations.
It provides that the Department's Office of Professional Responsibility (``OPR'') shall have jurisdiction to investigate
such allegations and that violations will be treated as matters of attorney discipline. See 28 CFR 0.39 (establishing
and defining duties of OPR). It also makes clear that the Attorney General's determination as to whether a violation
has occurred shall be final and conclusive except to the extent that the Department attorney enjoys a right of review
provided by other laws.

This paragraph provides that the proposed regulations are not intended and will not create any substantive rights
for any person other than an attorney for the government. In particular, a violation of the rule will not provide a basis
for the dismissal of civil or criminal charges or for the suppression of evidence that is otherwise admissible. This
provision accords with existing law. Traditionally, matters relating to communications with represented persons
have been treated as matters of attorney discipline without granting substantive rights to defendants or any other
persons. See, e.g., ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, Preliminary Statement; ABA Model Rules of Professional
Conduct, Scope. Of course, when the communication with a represented person or represented party violates the Constitution,
the federal courts retain the power to fashion appropriate remedies.

Section 77.12: Relationship to State and Local Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Both DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 provide that communications that are ``authorized by law'' are not prohibited
by the rule. Virtually all the states have adopted some version of DR 7&hyph;104 or Model Rule 4.2 that includes an ``authorized
by law'' exception. These proposed rules, as substantive regulations duly promulgated by the Attorney General pursuant
to statutory authority, have the force and effect of law. See e.g. Batterton

Francis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). Accordingly, communications with represented persons that are undertaken pursuant
to these rules should be considered ``authorized by law'' within the meaning of rules adopted by the various states.
Such communications will therefore be consistent with state rules wherever state bar authorities have adopted a
rule containing the ``authorized by law'' exception. Furthermore, no conflict will arise between state and federal
law in those jurisdictions with regard to communications with represented persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those states that do not currently include an ``authorized by law'' exception or repeal current provisions, the
proposed rule may conflict with their provisions governing communications with represented parties. The second
sentence of this section provides that in those cases the proposed regulations will preempt the application of conflicting
state and local rules as they relate to contacts by Department of Justice attorneys. The longstanding position of
the Department is that the Supremacy Clause bars ``any attempt by a state bar association to impose sanctions on a government
attorney who is acting lawfully and in pursuance of his federal law enforcement responsibilities.'' See Ethical
Restraints of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility on Federal Criminal Investigations, 4B Op. O.L.C. 576,
601&hyph;02 (1980). It is clear that a Department regulation published after notice and comment constitutes ``federal
law.'' See, e.g.,

rule is binding upon state authorities and supersedes contrary provisions of state law. The Supreme Court has recognized
that ``[f]ederal regulations have no less pre-emptive effect than federal statutes.''

Accordingly, to the extent the proposed regulations conflict with state law, the regulations preempt the conflicting
state law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section does, however, provide an important exception. If the Attorney General finds that a Department attorney
has willfully violated these regulations, preemption will not apply. As a result, a government attorney who willfully
engages in communications that violate these rules will be subject to disciplinary proceedings both by the Department
and by the appropriate state disciplinary authorities.

IV. United States Attorneys' Manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the promulgation of the proposed regulations discussed above, the Department proposes to add several
new provisions to the United States Attorneys' Manual to provide additional guidance to Department attorneys when
dealing with individuals or entities represented by counsel during criminal or civil law enforcement investigations
and proceedings. Those provisions are set forth in full below as part of this commentary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to include some restrictions in the Manual while other restrictions are contained in the rule was an important
one. In the process of determining what the appropriate Departmental policy should be, it became clear that any regulation
would have to apply to a variety of circumstances, including: White collar and organized crime investigations, complex
conspiracy investigations, individuals whose counsel are paid by a third party, and individuals fearful of their
counsel for various reasons. Accordingly, the Department determined that the regulations should be broad in scope
and should provide unambiguous guidance that would not adversely affect federal law enforcement efforts. Thus,
the regulations distinguish between the investigative period before indictment, arrest, or the filing of a complaint
and the period after arrest or the commencement of formal proceedings. They also distinguish between communications
that are part of a factual investigation and negotiations of plea agreements, settlements and similar legal arrangements.
At the same time, the Manual revisions require that government attorneys consider the principles underlying the
basic prohibitions in a much wider variety of circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department expects all Department attorneys involved in criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings to adhere
to these provisions. Failure to do so will result in appropriate departmental discipline.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are two especially important provisions that should be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, &sect;9&hyph;13.240 prohibits a government attorney from communicating with a person known to be represented
by counsel who the government attorney knows is a target of a federal criminal or civil enforcement investigation.
The Manual provides several exceptions to this general prohibition, including the following: When the communication
is initiated by the target; when the communication occurs at the time of arrest and the represented person has waived
his or her Constitutional rights; when the government attorney believes the contact is necessary to protect against
a risk to human life or safety; or when a senior Department official determines that exigent circumstances exist,
making the communication necessary for effective law enforcement. In addition, &sect;9&hyph;13.220 provides
an exception to the general prohibition if the communication is made in the course of an undercover investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Target'' is defined as a ``person as to whom the attorney for the government has substantial evidence linking that
person to the commission of a crime or to other wrongful conduct and as to whom the attorney for the government anticipates
seeking an indictment or naming as a defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding.'' Because an individual who
is a target of a federal investigation is typically in a clearly adversarial relationship with the federal government,
the Department believes that the principles underlying DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 are implicated and an extension
of the prohibition contained in the rule is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its enforcement of this provision, the Department intends to give substantial deference to a federal attorney's
good faith judgment regarding the likelihood that a particular person will ultimately become a defendant. Even if
the attorney for the government believes that an individual will probably be named as a defendant, that individual
is not considered a target until the government has actually obtained substantial evidence linking that individual
to the commission of a crime or to unlawful conduct. The government attorney's uncorroborated belief that an individual
will ultimately be named as a defendant is not enough. Thus, an individual is not considered a target under this rule
until both the attorney for the government believes that he or she will probably be named as a defendant and substantial
evidence has been obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second provision that should be noted is the approval procedure provided in &sect;9&hyph;13.250. Under that
provision, before an attorney for the government communicates with any represented party or target, the government
attorney should obtain the approval of the United States Attorney if the attorney is an Assistant United States Attorney,
or the approval of another appropriate supervisor. The provision also permits contacts when prior approval is not
feasible, and requires post-contact documentation.

Additions to the United States Attorneys' Manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The entire text of the planned additions to the Manual follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following new section is added to title 9, chapter 13. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

9&hyph;13.210&blank;Generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
28 CFR part 77 generally governs communications with represented persons in law enforcement investigations and
proceedings. This section sets forth several additional departmental policies and procedures with regard to such
communications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Justice attorneys should recognize that communications with represented persons at any stage may
present the potential for undue interference with attorney-client relationships and should undertake any such
communications with great circumspection and care. This Department as a matter of policy will respect bona fide attorney-client
relationships whenever possible, consistent with our law enforcement responsibilities and duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules set forth in 28 CFR part 77 are intended, among other things, to clarify the circumstances under which government
attorneys may communicate with represented persons. They are not intended to create any presumption that communications
are necessary or advisable in the course of any particular investigation or proceeding. Whether such a communication
is appropriate in a particular situation is to be determined by the government attorney (and, when appropriate, his
or her supervisors) in the exercise of his or her discretion, based on the specific circumstances of the individual
case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the application of this section, like the application of 28 CFR part 77, is limited to communications
between Department of Justice attorneys and persons known to be represented by counsel during criminal investigations
and proceedings or civil law enforcement investigations and proceedings. These provisions do not apply to Department
attorneys engaged in civil suits in which the United States is not acting under its police or regulatory powers. Thus,
state bar rules and not these provisions will generally apply in civil suits when the government is a defendant or a
claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attorneys for the government are strongly encouraged to consult with appropriate officials in the Department of
Justice when the application or interpretation of 28 CFR part 77 may be doubtful or uncertain. The primary points of
contact at the Department of Justice on questions regarding 28 CFR part 77 and this section are the Assistant Attorneys
General of the Criminal and Civil Divisions, or their designees.

9&hyph;13.220&blank;Communications During Investigative Stage

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 77.7 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, generally permits communications with represented persons
outside the presence of counsel that are intended to obtain factual information in the course of criminal or civil
law enforcement investigations before the person is a defendant or is arrested in a federal criminal case, or is a defendant
in a federal civil enforcement proceeding. Such communications must, however, have a valid investigative purpose
and comply with the procedures and considerations set forth below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the investigative stage of a case, an attorney for the government may communicate, or cause another to communicate,
with any represented person, including a ``target'' as defined in section 9&hyph;13.240, concerning the subject
matter of the representation if the communication is made in the course of an undercover investigation of possible
criminal or wrongful activity. Undercover communications during the investigative stage must be conducted in accordance
with 28 CFR &sect;77.2(f), and relevant policies and procedures of the Department of Justice, as well as the guidelines
for undercover operations of the federal law enforcement agency conducting the investigation (e.g., the Attorney
General's Guidelines on FBI Undercover Operations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overt communications during the investigative stage are subject to the procedures and considerations set forth
in sections 9&hyph;13.230 - 9&hyph;13.233 and 9&hyph;13.240 - 9&hyph;13.242, below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the investigative stage of a criminal or civil enforcement matter, an attorney for the government as a general
rule should communicate overtly with represented persons outside the presence of counsel only after careful consideration
of whether the communication would be handled more appropriately by others. Attorneys for the government may not,
however, cause law enforcement agents to make communications that the attorney would be prohibited from making personally.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28 CFR 77.8 prohibits an attorney for the government from initiating or engaging in negotiations of a plea agreement,
immunity agreement, settlement, sentence, penalty or other disposition of actual or potential civil or criminal
charges with a represented person without the consent of counsel. Discussion of the terms of a particular plea agreement,
immunity agreement or other agreement covered by the rule is prohibited. However, the attorney for the government
is not prohibited from responding to questions regarding the general nature of such agreements, potential charges,
potential penalties or other subjects related to such agreements. In such situations, an attorney for the government
should take care not to go beyond providing information on these and similar subjects, and generally should refer
the represented person to his or her counsel for further discussion of these issues, as well as make clear that the attorney
for the government will not negotiate any agreement with respect to the disposition of criminal charges, civil claims
or potential charges or claims or immunity without the presence or consent of counsel.

During the investigative stage, and absent compelling law enforcement reasons, an attorney for the government should
not deliberately initiate an overt communication with a represented person outside the presence of counsel if the
attorney for the government has provided explicit assurances to counsel for the represented person that no such communication
will be attempted and no intervening change in circumstances justifying such communications has arisen.

Except as provided in section 9&hyph;13.241 or as otherwise authorized by law, an attorney for the government should
not overtly communicate, or cause another to communicate overtly, with a represented person who the attorney for
the government knows is a target of a federal criminal or civil enforcement investigation and who the attorney for
the government knows is represented by an attorney concerning the subject matter of the representation without the
consent of the lawyer representing such person. A ``target'' is a person as to whom the attorney for the government
has substantial evidence linking that person to the commission of a crime or to other wrongful conduct and as to whom
the attorney for the government anticipates seeking an indictment or naming as a defendant in a civil law enforcement
proceeding. An officer or employee of an organization that is a target is not to be considered a target automatically
even if such officer's or employee's conduct contributed to the commission of the crime or wrongful conduct by the
target organization; likewise, organizations that employ, or employed, an officer or employee who is a target are
not necessarily targets themselves.

if one or more of the following circumstances exist:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Determination if Representation Exists. The communication is to determine if the target is in fact represented
by counsel concerning the subject matter of the investigation or proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Discovery or Judicial Administrative Process. The communication is made pursuant to discovery procedures or
judicial or administrative process, including but not limited to the service of a grand jury or trial subpoena, testimony
before a grand jury, service of a summons and complaint, notice of deposition, taking of a deposition, administrative
summons or subpoena or civil investigative demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Initiation of Communication by Represented Person. The represented person initiates the communication directly
with the attorney for the government or through an intermediary and, prior to the commencement of substantive discussions
on the subject matter of the representation and after being advised by the attorney for the government of the represented
person's right to speak through his or her attorney and/or to have the attorney present for the communication, manifests
that his or her waiver of counsel for the communication is voluntary, knowing and informed, and, if willing to do so,
signs a written statement to this effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Waivers at the Time of Arrest. The communication is made at the time of the arrest of the represented person, and
he or she is advised of his or her constitutional rights and voluntarily and knowingly waives them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Investigation of Additional, Different or Ongoing Crimes or Wrongful Conduct. The communication is made in the
course of an investigation of additional, different or ongoing criminal or wrongful conduct that is separate from
or committed after the criminal or wrongful activity as to which the person is a target.

of any person; the purpose of the communication is to obtain or provide information to protect against the risk of harm;
and the attorney for the government believes that the communication is reasonably necessary to protect against such
risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Effective Performance of Law Enforcement Functions. The Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before communicating, or causing another to communicate, with a target the attorney for the government knows is represented
by counsel regarding the subject matter of the communication, the attorney for the government should write a memorandum
describing the facts of the case and the nature of the intended communication. The memorandum should be sent to and
approved by the appropriate supervisor before the communication occurs. In United States Attorney's Offices, the
memorandum should be reviewed and approved by the United States Attorney. If the circumstances of the communication
are such that prior approval is not feasible, the attorney for the government should write a memorandum as soon after
the communication as practicable and provide a copy of the memorandum to the appropriate supervisor. This memo should
also set forth why it was not feasible to obtain prior approval. The provisions of this section do not apply if the communication

This part ensures the Department's ability to enforce federal law effectively and ethically, consistent with the
principles underlying Rule 4.2 of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, while eliminating
the uncertainty and confusion arising from the variety of interpretations given to that rule and analogous rules
by state and federal courts and by bar association organizations and committees. (Copies of the ABA Model Rule are
available through Order Fullfillment Office, American Bar Association, 750 North Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL
60611.

(b) Attorney-client meetings. An attorney for the government may not direct or cause an undercover law enforcement
agent or cooperating witness to attend or participate in lawful attorney-client meetings or communications, except
when the agent or witness is requested to do so by the represented person or party, defense counsel, or another person
affiliated or associated with the defense, and when reasonably necessary to protect the safety of the agent or witness
or the confidentiality of an undercover operation. If the agent or witness attends or participates in such meetings,
any information regarding lawful defense strategy or trial preparation imparted to the agent or witness shall not
be communicated to attorneys for the government or to law enforcement agents who are directly participating in the
ongoing investigation or in the prosecution of pending criminal charges, or used in any other way to the substantial
detriment of the client.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with current employees; organizational representation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A communication with a current employee of an organization that qualifies as a represented party or represented person
shall be considered to be a communication with the organization for purposes of this part only if the employee is a controlling
individual. A ``controlling individual'' is a current high level employee who is known by the government to be participating
as a decision maker in the determination of the organization's legal position in the proceeding or investigation
of the subject matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with former employees; organizational representation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A communication with a former employee of an organization that is represented by counsel shall not be considered to
be a communication with the organization for purposes of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with former or current employees; individual representation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A communication with a former or current employee of an organization who is individually represented by counsel may
occur only to the extent otherwise permitted by this part. However, a claim by an attorney that he or she represents
all or a large number of individual current and/or former employees of an organization does not suffice to establish
that those employees are represented persons or represented parties under this part. In such circumstances, prior
to engaging in communications that would be prohibited under this part as a result of the individual representation,
the attorney for the government shall communicate with the individual current or former employee to determine if
in fact that employee is represented by counsel concerning the subject matter of the investigation or proceeding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with separately represented controlling individuals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When this part would preclude discussions with a controlling individual as defined in &sect;77.10(a) and the controlling
individual has retained separate counsel on the relevant subject matter, an attorney for the government may communicate
with such individual in the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the controlling individual's separate counsel consents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the communication falls within one of the exceptions set forth in &sect;&sect;77.6 or 77.9; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the case in which the individual does not qualify as a represented party, if the individual initiates the communication
and states that he or she is communicating exclusively in his or her personal capacity and not on behalf of the represented
organizational party, and manifests that his or her waiver of counsel for the communication is voluntary, knowing
and informed, and, if willing to do so, signs a written statement to this effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with unrepresented controlling individuals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, an attorney for the government may communicate with a controlling
individual who is not individually represented as to the subject matter of the communication when the controlling
individual initiates the communication and states that he or she is communicating exclusively in his or her personal
capacity and not on behalf of the represented organizational party, and manifests that his or her waiver of counsel
for the communication is voluntary, knowing, and informed, and, if willing to do so, signs a written statement to this
effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple representation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nothing in this section is intended or shall be construed to affect the requirements of Rule 44(c) of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure, or to permit the multiple representation of an organization and any of its employees, or the
multiple representation of more than one such employee, if such representation is prohibited by any applicable law
or rule of attorney ethics.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exclusive enforcement by Attorney General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Attorney General shall have exclusive authority over this part and any violations of it, except as provided in
&sect;77.12. Allegations of violations of this part shall be investigated exclusively by the Office of Professional
Responsibility of the Department of Justice, and shall be addressed when appropriate as matters of attorney discipline
by the Department. The findings of the Attorney General or her designee as to an attorney's compliance or non-compliance
with this part shall be final and conclusive except insofar as the attorney for the government is afforded a right of
review by other provisions of law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
No private remedies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This part is not intended to and does not create substantive rights on behalf of criminal or civil defendants, targets
or subjects of investigations, witnesses, counsel for represented parties or represented persons, or any other
person other than an attorney for the government, and shall not be a basis for dismissing criminal or civil charges
or proceedings against represented parties or for excluding relevant evidence in any proceeding in any court of the
United States.

Relationship to state and local regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Communications with represented parties and represented persons pursuant to this part are intended to constitute
communications that are ``authorized by law'' within the meaning of Rule 4.2 of the American Bar Association Model
Rules of Professional Conduct, DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, and analogous
state and local federal court rules. (Copies of the ABA Model Rules and Code are available through Order Fulfillment
Office, American Bar Association, 750 North Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL 60611.) In addition, this part is intended
to preempt the application of state and local laws or rules to the extent that they relate to contacts by attorneys for
the government, and those acting at their direction or under their supervision, with represented parties or represented
persons in criminal and civil investigations and litigation. This part is designed to govern the conduct of attorneys
for the government in the discharge of their duties to the extent that state and local laws or rules are inconsistent
with this part. When the Attorney General finds a willful violation of any of the rules in this part, however, sanctions
for the violation of this part may be applied, if warranted by the appropriate state disciplinary authority.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On January 24, 1994, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) published a proposed rule proposing
to impose sanctions on Illinois under the discretionary authority granted USEPA under the Clean Air Act as amended
in 1990 (amended Act) for failure by the State to meet its commitment to adopt and submit a basic and enhanced motor vehicle
inspection and maintenance (I/M) State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision as required by the amended Act for the
Chicago and East St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas. The Illinois General Assembly passed the legislation required
to support such a SIP revision and on January 18, 1994, Illinois Governor Edgar signed the legislation. Because of
this favorable action, USEPA is withdrawing the January 24, 1994 proposed rule initiating the process to impose discretionary
sanctions. The USEPA is also canceling the previously announced hearings scheduled for March 2, 1994, in Chicago
and on March 4, 1994, in Collinsville.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On January 24, 1994 (59 FR 3540), USEPA published a proposed rule proposing to impose sanctions on Illinois under the
discretionary authority granted USEPA under section 110(m) of the amended Act for failure by the State to meet its
commitment to adopt and submit a basic and enhanced motor vehicle I/M SIP revision as required by the amended Act for
the Chicago and East St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas. The USEPA had notified Illinois by letter dated December
30, 1993, of its finding that Illinois had failed to submit the required SIP revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Illinois General Assembly subsequently passed the legislation required to support such a SIP revision and on
January 18, 1994, Illinois Governor Edgar signed the legislation. Because of this favorable action, USEPA is withdrawing
the January 24, 1994, proposed rule initiating the process to impose discretionary sanctions. The USEPA is also canceling
the previously announced hearings scheduled for March 2, 1994, in Chicago and for March 4, 1994, in Collinsville.
This withdrawal terminates the discretionary sanctions process initiated by the January 24, 1994, proposed rule.
The mandatory sanctions process under Section 179 of the Act initiated by USEPA's December 30, 1993, finding that
Illinois failed to submit the required SIP revision is not affected by this action. Under that process, USEPA must
impose sanctions within 18 months of that December 30, 1993, finding of failure to submit unless Illinois adopts and
formally submits a complete I/M SIP revision within 18 months of that failure to submit finding.

This proposed regulation would revise the regulations governing the program for Grants for Faculty Training Projects
in Geriatric Medicine and Dentistry authorized by section 777(b) of the Public Health Service Act (the Act), to implement
amendments made by the Health Professions Extension Amendments of 1992 by: (1) Adding a definition for the term ``Geriatric
psychiatry'' to implement the statutory requirement for the expansion of project support to include the training
of physicians who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry; (2) adding a definition for the term ``Relevant advanced training
or experience'' to implement the statutory requirement for dentists who are awarded a 2-year internal medicine or
family medicine fellowship (Dentists must have completed postdoctoral dental training, including postdoctoral
dental education programs or who have ``relevant advanced training or experience''.); and (3) removing a section
in the regulations regarding the period of time for appointments to fellowships to allow for less restrictive requirements
for those individuals who may benefit from further fellowship or retraining experience in a life time. Additionally,
technical and ministerial revisions are being made to conform the existing regulations with the amendments made
by the statute.

This proposed rule amends the existing regulations for Grants for Faculty Training Projects in Geriatric Medicine
and Dentistry, authorized under section 777(b) of the Public Health Service Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 294o). The Health
Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;408) amended and renumbered former section
789(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 295g&hyph;9(b)) to section 777(b).

Section 777(b) of the Act, as amended, authorizes the Secretary to make grants to and enter into contracts with accredited
schools of medicine, schools of osteopathic medicine, teaching hospitals, and graduate medical education programs,
for the purpose of providing support (including traineeships and fellowships) for geriatric training projects
to train physicians and dentists who plan to teach geriatric medicine, geriatric dentistry, or geriatric psychiatry.
programs supported by these grants emphasize the principles of primary care as demonstrated through continuity,
ambulatory, preventive, and psychosocial aspects of the practice of geriatric medicine, dentistry, and psychiatry.

The proposed amendments made by the Health Professions Extension Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;408) to section
777(b) are described below, according to the section numbers and headings of the regulations they affect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 57.4102&blank;Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is proposing to add the following terms to this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Geriatric psychiatry
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' means the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of mental disorders and disturbances seen in older
adults.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition is adapted from the definition used by the American Association of Geriatric Psychiatrists and is
added to the section to incorporate the statutory requirement for the expansion of project support to include the
training of physicians who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relevant advanced training or experience
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' means at least one of the following: (1) Completion of at least a 12-month graduate training program in a health-related
discipline, the basic sciences, or education; or (2) a minimum of 2 years of clinical practice, of which at least 12
months were devoted in part to managing older dental patients in a hospital, long-term care facility, or other setting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition was developed with consultation from an Ad Hoc Committee of Geriatric Dentists and with positive
internal review. The definition is added to the section to incorporate the statutory requirement for the expansion
of fellowship eligibility of dental fellows in the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 57.4111&blank;Duration of fellowships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is proposing to remove this section from the regulations. The regulatory language currently reads:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An appointment to a fellowship may be made for a period not to exceed 12 months. Fellowship assistance for participants
in a 1-year fellowship program and a 1-year retraining program is limited to 12 months. Participants in 2-year fellowship
programs may receive a second 12-month appointment for a total period of 24 months.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 102&hyph;408 no longer provides for a 1-year fellowship program. Further, the language regarding the
period of time for appointments to a fellowship is unnecessarily restrictive to individuals who may benefit from
further fellowship or retraining experience in a life time. For example, a faculty fellow who completed a 1-year retraining
to have the skills required to incorporate geriatrics into course content and clinical rotations may discover 5 years
later that another fellowship experience would provide the opportunity to develop research skills in geriatrics
required to expand the scope and depth of practice-based geriatric research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Private Radio Bureau issued a Public Notice soliciting additional comment and reply comment on written ex parte
presentations received by the Federal Communications Commission from PacTel Teletrac, Southwestern Bell Mobile
Systems, Inc. and Mobilevision in late January and early February 1994. Comments were due on or before February 25,
1994 and reply comments were due on or before March 7, 1994. This Order extends the period in which to comment on these
ex parte presentations through March 15, 1994, and extends the reply comment period through March 22, 1994. This action
provides commenters with additional time to account for alleged difficulty in obtaining the ex parte filings from
the Commission and eliminates ``confusion'' over the scope of comments permitted by stating that comments may be
filed on the ``technical'' issues as well as any other issues raised by these filings.

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has decided to pursue the development of amendments to the Federal poultry
products inspection regulations to define and standardize, or establish other requirements for poultry products
produced by mechanical deboning, including possible provisions for the composition, characteristics, and use
of such products, and requirements for manufacturing and labeling such products. FSIS has formed tentative positions
on the provisions of such amendments. FSIS needs additional public input on the general approach and parameters of
such rulemaking in order to help the regulation development process. FSIS is interested in receiving information
from the meat and poultry industries and industry-related organizations, the scientific community, academia,
consumers and consumer groups, and other interested parties prior to undertaking any such proposed rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Poultry products produced by mechanical deboning are characteristically finely comminuted (i.e., finely ground)
in form and result from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and
other tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses. The products are prepared from various materials, including
necks, backs, and whole carcasses. These starting materials may be raw or cooked, may contain varying amounts of muscle
and/or skin, and may contain kidneys, except when product is made from mature chickens or mature turkeys. Kidneys
of mature chickens or turkeys may not be used as human food (9 CFR 381.65(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technology to mechanically separate and remove most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and other tissue
of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses began in the late 1950's or early 1960's. The Department's initial reaction
was to consider the resulting product adulterated because of the amount of bone present and the physical size of the
bone particles. By the mid-1960's, the industry had modified and improved the equipment used to produce poultry product
by mechanical deboning such that product contained less than 11/2 percent bone solids with an extremely small bone
particle size. This prompted the Department to reevaluate its position. Widespread commercial production of products
containing mechanically deboned poultry began in the early 1970's. By 1975, poultry product produced by mechanical
deboning was being used as an ingredient in poultry and meat food products such as franks, bologna, salami, and rolls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today, poultry products produced by mechanical deboning are used in a wide variety of poultry products, including
cooked poultry sausages (such as chicken frankfurters, turkey salami, and turkey bologna), poultry patties and
nuggets (such as chicken patties and nuggets), and poultry baby foods. The level at which it is used has depended in
part on technological capabilities and has reached 100 percent of the poultry product portion of a number of cooked
poultry sausage products. Poultry product produced by mechanical means is also used at up to 49 percent of the formulations
of certain meat food products, e.g., beef and turkey chili, provided that it is identified in the product name as ``turkey,''
``chicken,'' etc., and used in meat food products including cooked sausages, such as frankfurters and bologna, at
a level of up to 15 percent of the total ingredients, excluding water (9 CFR 319.180).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, the poultry and meat food industries have also referred to poultry products produced by mechanical
means as ``comminuted (i.e., ground) poultry.'' Terminology such as ``finely comminuted,'' ``finely ground,''
and ``mechanically deboned'' have been used on poultry product labels to describe the form of the product according
to 9 CFR 381.117(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poultry products produced by mechanical means are subject to 9 CFR 381.117(d) relating to boneless poultry products.
This regulation requires boneless poultry products to be labeled in a manner that accurately describes their actual
form and composition. The product name must indicate the form of the product, e.g., emulsified or finely chopped,
and the kind name of the poultry from which it is derived. If the product does not consist of natural proportions of skin
and fat, as they occur in the whole carcass, the product name must also include terminology that describes the actual
composition. If the product is cooked, it must be so labeled. Section 381.117(d) also limits the bone solids content
of boneless poultry products to one percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poultry products produced by mechanical deboning also are subject to 9 CFR 381.47(e). This regulation requires that
rooms or compartments containing mechanical deboning equipment must be maintained at 50
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F or less during the mechanical deboning of raw poultry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing regulations do not distinguish between boneless poultry products produced by mechanical deboning and
poultry products produced by traditional methods, e.g., hand-deboning using high-speed knives. Poultry product
produced by mechanical deboning is declared in the ingredients statement of a product in which it is used, along with
any other boneless chicken product used, as ``chicken'' where skin and fat are included but not in excess of their natural
proportions, or as ``chicken meat'' when such components are not included.

Report on Health and Safety of Mechanically Deboned Poultry
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1976, the Department initiated an analytical program to obtain data on a number of nutrients and substances of potential
health concern in poultry products produced by mechanical deboning. Data were also gathered from scientific literature,
industry, other government agencies, and university scientists. Details of the analytical program and a resulting
evaluation were published in a June 1979 report entitled ``Health and Safety Aspects of the Use of Mechanically Deboned
Poultry'' (hereafter referred to as the 1979 health and safety report). An errata supplement correcting certain
items in the report was prepared and published on August 14, 1979 (44 FR 47576). (The June 1979 report and the errata
supplement are available for public inspection in the FSIS Hearing Clerk's office.) On June 29, 1979, the Department
announced the availability of this report and encouraged interested members of the public to comment on its content.
The Department also notified the public that it was particularly interested in receiving comments regarding the
proper labeling of products containing poultry product produced by mechanical deboning and what means, if any, should
be taken to implement the labeling recommendations in the report (44 FR 37965).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Department received 221 comments, most of which were general reactions to the labeling issues raised in the notice,
and health, safety, or economic concerns. Of the 187 commenters that expressed a general opinion on the adequacy of
the regulations concerning mechanically deboned poultry products, 175 were supportive. Some commenter stated
that the regulations have effectively controlled the use of product produced by mechanically deboning over many
years with a wide base of consumer acceptance, that such product is not significantly different from product produced
by hand deboning, that these regulations provide truthful labeling, and/or that the report and scientific literature
support the adequacy of current regulations. Other commenters indicated that mechanically deboned poultry should
be regulated the same as mechanically separated (species) (MS(S)) (then named mechanically processed (species)
product).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1983, the General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report recommending that the Secretary of Agriculture direct
the Administrator of FSIS to establish specific standards on poultry products produced by mechanical deboning and
labeling requirements on products made with such poultry products as had been done for MS(S) and products made with
MS(S). MS(S) is a finely comminuted product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone
from attached skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and parts of carcasses that meets the provisions of 9 CFR 319.5.

Improvements in Machinery for the Poultry Products Produced by Mechanical Deboning

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Agency has monitored the advances in the technology for mechanically deboning poultry products over the last
decade. There have been improvements in the efficiency of the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone
from attached skeletal muscle and tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of poultry carcasses. Today, it has been estimated
that roughly 700 million pounds of raw poultry materials are used to manufacture mechanically deboned poultry which
is used, in turn, to formulate approximately 400 million pounds of poultry sausages (including franks, bologna,
and salami), and 300 million pounds of poultry nuggets and poultry patties.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 There have been major advances in mechanical deboning machinery in terms of the effectiveness of bone removal from
skeletal muscle and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses. This has been accomplished through
enhancements and modifications of the bone-removal devices that are part of the traditional mechanical deboning
machines. There have been continued refinements of certain operational parameters of the machinery, e.g., the ability
for operators to adjust the pressure needed to force ground poultry bones with adhering muscle and other tissues through
screens to separate muscle and other tissues from bone, and the size of the apertures (i.e., holes) in the screens and
sieves through which the ground bones, muscle, and other tissues are pushed. These improvements have resulted in
the ability to decrease the bone solids that are a result of the mechanical deboning process for poultry to less than
the one percent reflected in the current poultry products regulations (9 CFR 381.117(d)).

In 1969, the Department amended the regulations for poultry and poultry products inspection to, among other things,
provide labeling requirements for boneless poultry products, including a prescribed bone solids content of not
more than one percent (34 FR 13991). This limit was based on an evaluation conducted by the Department of the operating
results in a series of poultry plants that used mechanical deboning equipment. Analyses were made of 485 samples of
raw, mechanically deboned product from nine commercial operations that used the three types of machines most often
used in the process. The analyses showed that the equipment, at that time, could be operated under commercial conditions
to produce boneless poultry that contained no more than one percent bone solids, on a raw weight basis, and the Department
concluded that it was demonstrated that it was practical to limit the bone content in deboned poultry to one percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the improvements that have occurred with regard to the machinery used to mechanically separate and remove
most of the bone from the muscle and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses, FSIS recently conducted
a study of the bone solids content of mechanically deboned poultry.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The percentage of bone solids content (determined by calcium analysis) in boneless poultry products produced by
mechanically deboning was collected from approximately 50 plants during August 1993, and represented a sampling
of over 2000 products. The data indicate that the mean bone solids content of the samples of these products was approximately
0.6 percent; generally, half of the percentages were above 0.6 percent and half were below 0.6 percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On June 15, 1993, FSIS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (58 FR 33040) soliciting comments, information,
scientific data, and recommendations regarding the consideration of the need for labeling of poultry product produced
by mechanical deboning and products in which such poultry product is used. FSIS indicated it was considering the need
for rulemaking that would establish regulations on the labeling of poultry product produced by mechanical deboning
and products in which such poultry product is used.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FSIS received 2744 comments in response to the ANPR, most of which were general reactions to the labeling issues. Two
thousand five hundred and ninety comments were submitted by consumers, 113 by food manufacturers/distributors,
17 by food retailers, 14 by trade associations, 4 by individuals from the Federal government, 3 by academia, 2 by food
consultants, and 1 by a law firm. The majority of the commenters responded to whether there was a need to identify mechanically
deboned poultry (MDP) in the ingredients statement on the labels of meat and poultry products in which it is used as
an ingredient.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
One thousand four hundred and eighty-seven commenters supported identifying MDP in the ingredients statement on
the labels of meat and poultry products in which it is used. These commenters include 1452 consumers, 8 food manufacturers/distributors,
17 food retailers, 4 trade associations, 4 individuals, one food consultant, and one law firm representative. The
commenters provided the following general reasons why MDP should be identified on a finished meat or poultry product
label. They stated that: (1) Consumers have a right to know that MDP is present in a product, (2) meat and poultry products
should be labeled the same, i.e., there should be parity in labeling regulations, (3) MDP contains higher amounts
of ``calcium,'' ``cholesterol,'' and/or ``bone particles'' and, therefore, should be identified, and (4) MDP should
be identified because there is ``a difference'' between MDP and hand-deboned poultry. The eight food manufacturers/distributors
and four consumers also stated that consumers should be made aware (through labeling) that MDP contains ``kidneys,''
``sex glands,'' and ``lungs.'' The food manufacturers/distributors also pointed out that mechanical deboning
processes that crush or grind bones should be labeled as such, regardless of kind (i.e., species). Most of the food
manufacturers/distributors encouraged FSIS to work with industry's scientific experts and the meat community
to define ``meat'' and ``poultry'' through standards of ``product safety and nutritional composition.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining 1,257 commenters did not support identifying MDP in the ingredients statement on the labels of finished
meat and poultry products for the following reasons: (1) The Agency's current policy should continue and MDP has a
history of safe use for 25-plus years without labeling it as anything other than ``chicken,'' ``turkey meat,'' etc.,
(2) nutrition labeling will be a means of educating consumers about product composition and will address any concerns
with regard to the nutrient qualities of the products they purchase, (3) listing MDP separately in the ingredients
statement would mislead consumers into thinking they are purchasing products that are inferior to what they have
(historically) purchased, (4) any changes in labeling regulations on MDP would only serve to confuse consumers into
believing something ``has been added to their products'' when, in fact, no changes have been made, and (5) a change
in labeling would result in a severe negative economic impact ``on the entire poultry industry and U.S. economy, as
well as many U.S. trading partners that now use these items as a food source.'' One food manufacturer stated that beef
and pork are different species with obvious differences in bone mass, skeletal size, amount of calcification, and
bone hardness, and, therefore, MDP should not be labeled the same as MS(S), which incorporates bone and the constituents
of bone in the product. Some of the trade associations recommended that if MS(S) meets the same criteria for MDP in 9
CFR 381.117, it should be entitled to analogous labeling. Some of the trade associations also believe that MDP and
MS(S) should not be defined by the process used to make them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The academicians stated that the method of removal of meat tissue from bones of carcasses should not become part of
the name of the product, and, as long as the end products are comparable and meet the ``rules'' for starting materials,
composition, sanitation, etc., the method of processing should not become part of the product name. The commenters
also stated that MDP is an excellent source of protein and calcium.

FSIS's Response to the Comments on the June 15, 1993, ANPR and Issues Regarding Poultry Products Produced by Mechanical
Deboning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In its June 15, 1993, ANPR, FSIS solicited comments, information, scientific data, and recommendations regarding
the consideration of the need for labeling of poultry product produced by mechanical deboning and products in which
such poultry product is based. FSIS did not receive any new data regarding the health and safety aspects of the use of
such products, and, therefore, FSIS believes that there are no new health and safety concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although, many of the commenters of the June 15, 1993, ANPR raised concerns regarding the labeling of calcium and cholesterol
contents of poultry product produced by mechanical deboning, the provisions of the nutrition labeling regulations
(58 FR 632) published by FSIS, which are to be effective July 6, 1994, would be a means of educating consumers regarding
certain nutrients and other components of processed meat and poultry products containing poultry product produced
by mechanical deboning, including calcium and cholesterol. Calcium and cholesterol declaration becomes necessary
on the labeling of most multi-ingredient poultry and meat products upon the effective date. These regulations also
establish a voluntary nutrition labeling program for single-ingredient, raw products, and specify that FSIS will
evaluate significant participation of the voluntary program. If significant participation is not found, FSIS shall
initiate rulemaking to require nutrition labeling on those products under the voluntary program. Therefore, with
certain exceptions, consumers will have complete information about the nutrients in poultry products. Such information
will ensure that consumers are not mislead about the composition of products containing poultry products produced
by mechanical deboning.

FSIS recognizes that not all products sold to consumers at the retail level will carry nutrition labeling. FSIS's
final regulation on nutrition labeling provided for certain exemptions including products produced by small businesses
and products in individually wrapped packages of less than 1/2 ounce net weight, provided that the labels for these
products bear no nutrition claims or nutrition information. However, labeling will be required on most processed
products purchased by consumers in retail stores so that, together with the voluntary program for retail store information
on single-ingredient, raw products, consumers will have information on calcium and cholesterol for most products
purchased for consumption at home.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the comments FSIS received in response to its June 15, 1993, ANPR on the presence of kidneys in poultry products
produced by mechanical deboning, FSIS requires the removal of kidneys of mature turkeys and chickens from their carcasses
before the eviscerating operations during the slaughtering process (9 CFR 381.65(d)). Kidneys of mature poultry
pose a potential health concern because of the possibility of the presence of certain heavy metals. Further, in regard
to the comments made about lungs and sex glands, these are precluded from being present in ``ready-to-cook'' poultry
(i.e., poultry subsequent to the slaughtering process) by the poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR 381.1(b)(44)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS acknowledges that many of the reasons provided by commenters for maintaining the Agency's current policy on
labeling poultry products produced by mechanical deboning are valid. However, a substantial number of comments
reflect the consumer's ``right to know'' that poultry product produced by mechanical deboning is in their food because
of the unexpected presence of bone. FSIS believes that these comments refer to the boneless poultry product produced
by mechanical deboning which has greater than 0.6 bone solids content, but no more than one percent bone solids content.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is now considering issues in regard to the lack of a regulatory definition and standard for certain poultry products
produced by mechanical deboning_products which are deemed to be similar to mechanically separated (species) (MS(S)),
for which a regulatory definition and standard exist (9 CFR 319.5). (``Species'' refers to the species of livestock,
e.g., beef or pork.) MS(S) is defined as ``any finely comminuted product resulting from the mechanical separation
and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and parts of carcasses'' and meeting
the other provisions specified in 9 CFR 319.5. Provisions in the Federal meat inspection regulations provide, among
other things, a definition and standard that classifies MS(S) as a meat food product and a requirement that MS(S) be
separately identified in the ingredients statement of a meat food product in which it is used as an ingredient (9 CFR
317.2 (c) and (f), 319.1, and 319.5). FSIS's 1982 final rulemaking on MS(S) (47 FR 28214) indicates that the Agency
determined that material differences in the consistency and the composition of MS(S) place it outside the scope of
the product traditionally defined as meat (9 CFR 301.2(rr)), and that its differences are such that it should be defined
as a distinctive standardized product. As such, it should be identified by a name that adequately differentiates
it from meat, viz., MS(S). When MS(S) is used in meat food products, it must be separately listed in the ingredients
statement by its standardized name, e.g., ``mechanically separated beef (or pork).''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, the meat and poultry industries have referred to poultry produced by mechanical deboning as ``mechanically
deboned poultry'' and ``comminuted poultry,'' and have declared the product as poultry or poultry meat (e.g., ``chicken''
and ``turkey meat'') in the ingredients statement of the labels of products in which it is used as ingredients. Several
red meat sausage manufacturers have alleged that, without a regulatory definition and standard for poultry products
produced by mechanical deboning, a disparate situation exists between labeling certain poultry products produced
by mechanical deboning and MS(S) which poses an unfair advantage for the manufacturers of poultry products and may
deny consumers useful information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has considered the appropriate course for addressing these issues, and has initiated two actions in response
to them. FSIS is contemplating proposing regulations on poultry products produced by mechanical deboning, and is
soliciting comments and requesting data on various tentative positions in this advance notice of proposed rulemaking.
The other action is a proposal found elsewhere in this issue of the

FSIS is considering, among other things, that certain poultry products produced by mechanical deboning, i.e., those
with greater than 0.6 percent bone solids content, but no more than one percent bone solids content, be separately
identified on the labels of products in which they are used as ingredients by a distinct name. However, because of the
improvements in separating the bone from muscle and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses, FSIS
is considering, among other things, that some boneless poultry products derived from mechanical deboning machinery,
i.e., those with 0.6 percent or less bone solids, be identified on the label of products in which they are used as poultry
or poultry meat, e.g., ``chicken'' and ``turkey meat.'' Until the Agency receives further data and information to
support this position, it cannot take a firm position on the content of a proposed regulation on this topic. Therefore,
FSIS is issuing this ANPR that provides an in-depth discussion, which follows, on the labeling of MDP, as well as other
issues related to boneless poultry product produced by mechanical deboning, and expresses the Agency's tentative
positions regarding these issues. It is FSIS's intent to obtain the information and data necessary to solidify its
position regarding the labeling, use, and production of poultry products produced by mechanical deboning.

A. Tentative position: Definition and standard of identity and composition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS's tentative position is to prescribe a definition and standard of identity for the finely comminuted poultry
product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and
other tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses which has greater than 0.6 percent bone solids content. While
whole carcasses sometimes are used, the starting materials for this type of processing frequently are parts of carcasses,
such as frames, backs and necks, which contain relatively low proportions of skeletal muscle, or parts, such as breast
frames, from which most of the skeletal muscle already has been removed by traditional deboning techniques. This
product is commonly known in the poultry industry as mechanically deboned poultry or MDP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes under consideration would include (1) amending the Federal poultry products inspection regulations
by defining MDP as ``mechanically separated (kind),'' or another appropriate term, using limits for bone solids
content and bone particle size, and criteria for protein quality, and requirements for labeling of the product in
products in which it is used as an ingredient, and (2) amending the poultry products inspection regulations to require
that such poultry products produced by mechanical deboning be kept at temperatures of 40 degrees F or below within
2 hours of the deboning operation. The resulting product differs from poultry products produced by traditional deboning
techniques in its highly comminuted and spread-like consistency and in its content of bone and associated tissue,
as well as muscle, skin, and fat. These differences have a potential consequence for finished product microbiological
quality and, thus, for health and safety. Therefore, certain handling requirements may be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the differences between MDP and boneless poultry derived by traditional methods (e.g., hand-deboning),
it appears inappropriate to continue to include MDP within the category of ``boneless poultry products'' (9 CFR 381.117(d)).
Instead, FSIS is considering defining it as a distinct poultry product ingredient and standardizing its characteristics
under Subpart P of the poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR part 381, subpart P).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS's tentative position is that the boneless poultry products regulation (9 CFR 381.117(d)) no longer would apply
to MDP. Consequently, the current restriction on bone solids content in this regulation_as enforced by limiting
calcium content_would be included with other compositional requirements in a MDP standard. Product failing to meet
the bone particle size, or protein quality requirements of the standard could be used only in producing poultry extractives,
including fats, stocks, and broths, (i.e., processors would be permitted to employ acceptable procedures for extracting
components such as fat, but such product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal process could only
be used for further processing). Mechanically deboned poultry with a protein content of less than 14 percent and/or
a fat content of more than 25 percent would be deemed to be product for processing. Moreover, as a standardized product,
MDP would be differentiated from other poultry product ingredients; and it would be designated in the ingredient
statements on finished product labels by the name specified in its definition and standard, in accordance with 9 CFR
317.2(c)(2) and (f)(1) and 381.118(a).

Tentative position: Product name. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS's tentative position is to consider amending the Federal poultry products inspection regulations to define
the standardized product that results from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from poultry
carcasses and parts of carcasses by a distinctive name. FSIS is tentatively considering that ``Mechanically Separated
(Kind) (MS(K))'' is an appropriate, nonmisleading name for this product. It appears to accurately and concisely
describe the product, indicating the nature of the process by which and the kind of poultry from which it is made, distinguishing
it from poultry product ingredients produced by traditional hand-deboning techniques. The name under consideration
includes ``(kind)'' rather than ``poultry'' to make it clear that the kind of poultry (9 CFR 381.1(b)(40)) from which
the product is made is specified (e.g., ``Mechanically Separated Chicken''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously indicated, FSIS believes that MDP differs sufficiently from boneless poultry products produced by
traditional hand-deboning techniques that it should be regulated as a separate, standardized ingredient. As such,
this product would be defined by its own, distinctive name, and it would be referred to by that name in relevant regulations
and in labeling. In this regard, FSIS is requesting public input on other names that would accurately and appropriately
describe MDP as a distinct ingredient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is aware that other descriptions have been associated with poultry products produced by mechanically deboning.
In addition to the use of terminology such as ``finely comminuted'' poultry to specify the form of the product and ``mechanically
deboned'' poultry, such product has been referred to as mechanically separated poultry within the meat and poultry
industries. FSIS believes that where a primary distinguishing characteristic of a standardized product is its bone
content, it would be inappropriate to define it by a name that includes the term ``deboned'' and use of this term in labeling
might mislead consumers by implying such product contains no bone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons commenting on this portion of the ANPR should be aware that FSIS does not consider that current familiarity
with terminology or its appeal to consumers is dispositive on the question of what terminology is most likely to achieve
its objectives for the name of a standardized product: instantaneous consumer familiarity and acceptance cannot
and should not be expected when labels declare the presence of a product for the first time. However, consumer perceptions
are important in determining whether or not terminology that is technically accurate nevertheless may be confusing
or even misleading. When FSIS establishes a definition and standard for a product with respect to which a specified
name is deemed appropriate, the product must be called by that name in labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Bone solids content. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering that a definition and standard for MDP would incorporate the existing restriction on the bone
solids content of mechanically deboned poultry products, viz., not more than one percent (9 CFR 381.117(d)). Because
this restriction is enforced by limiting calcium content, FSIS is considering that the definition and standard for
MDP should include maximum calcium content levels of not more than 0.235 percent in product made from turkeys or mature
chickens or 0.175 percent in product made from other poultry, as a measure of bone solids content_based on the weight
of product that has not been prepared with heat treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, FSIS adopted the one percent bone solids restriction after appraising the operating results
in a series of poultry plants using mechanical deboning equipment, analyzing 485 samples of raw product, and concluding
that existing equipment can be operated under commercial conditions to produce product which meets this limit (34
FR 13991, 13992). When processors applied the mechanical deboning technology to poultry products such as fowl frames
that have been heat treated using various cooking methods, FSIS modified its procedures to take into account weight
loss that can occur with cooking. Thus, the practice has been to permit an allowance for weight loss in order to reflect
the bone solids content that would have been present if heat treatment has not occurred; and the adjusted level may
not exceed one percent. The ``Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook,'' U.S. Department of Agriculture (section 6.010F,
page 6&hyph;33),
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 currently includes procedures for different degrees of adjustment depending on whether conventional cooking methods
(i.e., open kettle) or other heat treatment (e.g., pressure cooking) are used.

After evaluating data on substances of potential concern that may tend to concentrate in bone, the 1979 report on health
and safety aspects of the use of mechanically deboned poultry did not recommend any change in the existing bone solids
limit. (The report did, however, recommend limitations on the use of product made from fowl because of bone constituents
like fluoride; FSIS's tentative position is to amend the poultry products inspection regulations accordingly,
as discussed below.) Because enforcement is based on calcium content analyses, rather than direct measurements
of bone solids, FSIS is considering that an amended regulation would include the maximum amount of calcium permitted
in determining whether mechanically deboned poultry is in compliance. As discussed below, FSIS is also considering
that production under an approved quality control program is needed to assure that such product is manufactured to
comply with regulatory requirements on a consistent basis and that implementation of a quality control program would
increase the effectiveness of enforcement of the restriction on bone solids content.

FSIS has developed two different calcium content levels for this purpose. Both of these levels account for the fact
that poultry tissues, other than bone, contain some calcium. The higher level_0.235 percent_reflects the greater
proportion of calcium in the bones of mature chickens and turkeys as compared with young chickens (i.e., the lower
ratio of bone solids to calcium). The lower level_0.175 percent_has been used by FSIS in enforcing the one percent
restriction on product made from young chickens. Both of these calcium levels are equivalent to one percent bone solids
using the conversion formulas for calculating bone solids from calcium on a weight basis.

The formula for calculating bone solids from calcium for poultry products is in the ``Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook,''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since FSIS is considering proposing a definition and standard that includes potential types of mechanically deboned
product, FSIS's tentative position is to allow 0.175 percent calcium as the maximum for all MDP that is made from poultry
other than turkeys or mature chickens. FSIS is interested in receiving comments regarding the calcium levels applicable
to MDP made from other kinds of poultry, e.g., ducks, geese, and guineas, especially calcium levels applicable to
mature poultry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the ``Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook'' (section 6.010F, page 6&hyph;33) has been revised to include
a procedure that could be applied to mechanically deboned product made only in part from mature chickens. That procedure
involves a determination of the relative mature and young chicken proportions when product is made from a combination
of young and mature chickens. FSIS is considering, as discussed below, that production of MDP under an approved quality
control program is necessary to assure consistent compliance with regulatory requirements, including the calcium
content requirement utilized in restricting bone solids content. Therefore, as the discussion of the proposed quality
control provision indicates, FSIS's tentative position is that, if mechanically deboned chicken is made from a combination
of young and mature chickens, the application of any intermediate value between 0.175 and 0.235 percent in verifying
compliance would be contingent upon an establishment's program for quality control including methods that support
such value's appropriateness as a measure of a bone solids content to not more than one percent; and without such methods,
the 0.175 percent limit should apply. FSIS wishes to receive comments on the determination of the calcium levels associated
with MDP made from a combination of young and mature poultry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of these calcium content levels in the definition and standard FSIS is considering should not be misinterpreted
as indicating a concern about the amount of the essential nutrient calcium that is provided by poultry and meat food
products. FSIS agrees with the findings in the 1979 health and safety report that, even assuming all further processed
poultry were made with mechanically deboned poultry (i.e., a far greater level of production and use than actually
occurs), the projected calcium contribution such products would represent only a negligible increase in per capita
daily intakes and cannot be considered hazardous, particularly since the dietary intake of a large sector of the population
may be below the recommended level of calcium consumption.

Tentative position: Bone particle size. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering restricting the size of the bone particles in MDP to a maximum of less than 1.5 millimeter (mm) in
the greatest dimension, but permitting up to 5 bone particles per 50 grams of MDP to be from 1.5 mm to less to 2.0 mm in the
greatest dimension. The need to limit the size of bone particles in MDP has been acknowledged since the poultry industry
began to use mechanical methods for manufacturing this product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1979 health and safety report, it was recommended that bone particle size be controlled to ensure that equipment
type of processing does not result in unacceptably large fragments and concluded that, provided this is done, the
bone particles in the product will not present any health hazard because of size or hardness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering that it is appropriate to permit up to 5 particles per 50 grams of product to be from 1.5 mm to less
than 2.0 mm as an acceptable defect in complying product. FSIS is requesting comments and information on the extent
to which manufacturers should be required to control the production of mechanically separated poultry product to
limit the size of bone particles. FSIS will consider any information submitted during the comment period on the size
and distribution of bone particles that may occur with various mechanical deboning procedures conducted in accordance
with good manufacturing practices (e.g., the extent to which deviations or nonconforming particles occur, and data
substantiating the absence of potential health or finished product quality problems with such particles).

Tentative position: Protein quality. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering requiring that MDP meet a minimum protein quality requirement_a protein digestibility-corrected
amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent and to accept as evidence of compliance with this requirement
an alternative measurement_the content of 7 essential amino acids being at least 33 percent of the total of 17 amino
acids present. Protein quality is a measure of the content, proportion, and availability of essential amino acids
in food protein and a measure of the ability of the food protein to support human growth and body protein maintenance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the regulation on MS(S) (a finely comminuted product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of
most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and parts of carcasses that meets the provisions
of 9 CFR 319.5) was published in 1982 (47 FR 28214), one of the methods specified for measuring protein quality was the
Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) procedure. The PER method measures the ability of a protein source to support growth
in young growing rats, and is an expensive and time-consuming assay. FSIS adopted a newer method for measuring protein
quality, in order to assure the value of the protein contributed by meat and poultry to human dietary needs, in its final
regulations on nutrition labeling of meat and poultry products published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 632). The newer procedure, termed the protein digestibility_corrected amino acid score
method, is contained in ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein
Quality Evaluation,'' Rome, 1990 (PDCAAS method).
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The protein digestibility_corrected amino acid score method is based on human amino acid requirements and, therefore,
is more appropriate for evaluating the protein quality of foods for human consumption that the PER which is based on
amino acid requirements of rats. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method measures the ability
of amino acids in food proteins to meet the dietary protein needs of humans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering proposing a requirement that the protein in MDP have a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected
amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent. This value is consistent with nutrition labeling requirements
for protein in foods for children older than one but less than four years of age, as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(7), which
is cross-referenced in its final nutrition regulations (58 CFR 632) in 9 CFR 317.309(b). FSIS believes this value
protects the young consumer from inadequate nutrition and from the use of poor quality protein (i.e., protein that
does not meet the dietary needs for growth), and in turn, protects people other than young consumers. FSIS also believes
that it may be appropriate to assure comparability of MDP with boneless poultry and poultry that is derived by hand-deboning
in terms of the protein contributed to human dietary needs to maintain the quality and integrity of the poultry products
supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing to permit an alternative measurement to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score
method, which requires a digestibility measurement in addition to an amino acid analysis, to control the cost of monitoring
compliance with the protein quality requirement. FSIS is considering proposing that, for the purpose of measuring
the protein quality of MDP, an alternative measurement of protein quality would be allowed that is comparable to the
protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score. This measure would be based on a comparison between the ``essential
amino acid content of MDP'' and ``total amino acids present in MDP.'' Essential amino acid content includes isoleucine,
leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine content, and the total amino acids present including
isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine,
alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, proline, serine, and hydroxyproline content. It is being considered
that the essential amino acid content would be determined by methods given in the ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report
of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that MDP found to be in compliance by the proposed amino acid content measurement would have protein
of high quality. This belief is supported by the 1982&hyph;83 evaluation of an Expert Work Group that was organized
by the Department's Agricultural Research Service, in cooperation with the University of Maryland, to develop recommendations
based on available scientific knowledge for consideration in policy decisions regarding the protein quality of
meat, poultry, and their products.

The public should be aware that FSIS continues to have interest in investigations of protein quality which include
among their objectives the identification of improved methods for determining protein quality. In evaluating the
possible use of alternative approaches to assuring protein quality, FSIS will consider data and other comments submitted
by the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Protein and fat contents. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering allowing for two categories of MDP for use in the formulation of poultry products and meat food
products: (1) A category which meets minimum protein and maximum fat content requirements of not less than 14 percent
and not more than 25 percent, respectively, and (2) a category designated ``for processing'' for which there are no
protein or fat content requirements. As discussed below, it is contemplated that a wider range of use would be permitted
for product containing not less than 14 percent protein and not more than 25 percent fat, than for product for processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques vary significantly in fat content, largely depending
on the extent to which they include skin (with attached fatty tissue) and/or separable fat_the major sources of fat
in poultry. A similar pattern was evident in the data on mechanically deboned poultry products reviewed in the 1979
health and safety report, although mechanically deboned product tended to contain more fat. This tendency is not
surprising since mechanically deboned product frequently is prepared from necks, which have a higher skin content
than other poultry parts, and/or backs, which have a higher skin content than other poultry parts, and because it can
include bone marrow, which contains as much or more fat than skin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While, as with fat content, there is considerable variability in the protein content of both mechanically deboned
poultry and poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques, in the data reviewed in the 1979 health
and safety report on MDP, MDP generally contained less protein. In addition, the 1979 report found much higher moisture
to protein ratios in mechanically deboned poultry, indicating considerable dilution of poultry product, possibly
by ice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the poultry products inspection regulations do not directly control the fat or protein content of poultry
product ingredients. However, they do differentiate between ``poultry meat'' and ``poultry,'' i.e., chicken meat
and chicken, with the latter encompassing edible parts such as skin and fat not in excess of their natural proportions
in addition to poultry meat. As skin (with attached fatty tissue) and separable fat are the places in which most of the
fat in poultry products is found and poultry products are composed essentially of fat, protein, and moisture, these
definitions have served, to some extent, to distinguish among poultry products in terms of their relative fat and
protein contents. Moreover, these differentiations in fat and protein have consequences for the use of poultry product
ingredients, since many of the standards of identity or composition for finished poultry products include minimum
poultry meat requirements (9 CFR 381.167) and others limit skin and fat to natural proportions (9 CFR 381.160).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal FSIS is considering is to develop a regulatory approach that fulfills its responsibility to protect the public
by maintaining the quality and integrity of the poultry and meat food product supply while continuing to permit flexibility
in the composition of mechanically deboned poultry product, as well as in its use at various levels in a broad range
of products. In FSIS's view, its responsibility to the public includes the objectives of preventing increases in
the fat content of this portion of the food supply and preventing poultry product dilution that could result in the
public no longer being able to rely on poultry products and meat food products as reasonably good sources of high quality
dietary protein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering that MDP should have a fat content of not more than 25 percent and a protein content of not less than
14 percent or it shall be deemed to be product for processing. If these views are adopted, the effect of this provision
would be to impose no maximum on the fat content or minimum on the protein content of this ingredient where other regulatory
provisions assure that the fat content of finished products does not exceed appropriate limits and protect against
decreases in their protein content by establishing finished product content requirements. In such a product, it
is contemplated that MDP could be used, regardless of its fat or protein content, in ingredient mixtures that accord
with the standard for the finished product.

Tentative position: Quality control. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering that a quality control program is necessary to assure that establishments manufacture mechanically
deboned poultry product that complies consistently with the tentative definition and standard that is being considered
by FSIS. Utilization of such a program in producing the ingredient MDP would be a prerequisite for the approval of labels
for products consisting of or containing MDP. The function of plant quality control is to restrict potential variability
within the limits of the tentative requirements FSIS is considering by controlling the factors that can affect the
resulting product's characteristics.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS expects to require that MDP be produced under an approved plant quality control program. Also, FSIS is considering
a requirement that the plant quality control program provide the controls and information necessary to assure that
MDP manufactured under such a program meets any requirements established and that it will enable establishment personnel
and FSIS to monitor it for effectiveness. FSIS is focusing on methods that will minimize inter-lot variation by maintaining
the uniformity of starting materials and controlling the handling and processing of starting materials and resulting
product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because it appears that this goal can be achieved effectively and efficiently where a program for quality control
incorporates appropriate methods and monitoring techniques and adheres to good manufacturing practice, FSIS contemplates
requiring that an establishment conduct only limited analyses for protein quality and fat, and for MDP represented
as containing not less than 14 percent protein and not more than 25 percent fat, to confirm that production is, in fact,
under control. After it has been demonstrated that the quality control program is able to yield complying product,
confirmatory analyses would be required only periodically, as long as the product is in compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS anticipates establishing basic parameters for the chemical analyses that must be performed to verify compliance
with the requirements, e.g., defining production lots and sampling schedules, and the accepted methodology for
performing analyses. FSIS wishes to receive comments on the parameters necessary for an adequate quality control
program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Handling requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Current regulatory requirements, including provisions for sanitation, operating procedures, and heat processing
(9 CFR part 381, subpart H and I, and &sect;381.150), already provide the basic controls necessary to prevent spoilage
and assure poultry product wholesomeness. However, because the mechanical deboning process presents greater opportunities
for bacterial growth than traditional poultry product processing, FSIS is considering amending the poultry products
inspection regulations to more specifically address the requirements for the various starting materials used for
MDP and the resulting product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the data reviewed in the 1979 health and safety report indicate that MDP products generally are acceptable
from a microbiological standpoint, the data also show that where bacterial loads tend to be higher, it can be attributed
to the starting material used. This is not surprising as common starting materials for mechanical deboning are products
that remain after the removal of a substantial portion of skeletal muscle or other tissue (e.g., skin) from poultry
carcasses or parts of carcasses. As a result, the resistance of the exposed surface area to microbial penetration
has been reduced and the ratio of the surface area to the volume of total product which is exposed to contaminating influences
has been increased. Higher microbial counts in MDP have been associated with the time and conditions of holding such
starting materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mechanically deboned poultry itself also presents opportunities for excessive microbiological growth because
it consists of small particles which have a greater surface area than most poultry products and because during its
preparation any microorganisms that are present are distributed throughout the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that potential bacterial hazards are diminished as long as handling accords with good manufacturing
practices. FSIS is, therefore, considering that processing and storage requirements are warranted for the raw materials
used to make the product and for the product itself.

&cir;C) or less, frozen at 0

food product directly after being processed, except that it may be held prior to such use for no more than 72 hours at
40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS recognizes that different starting materials will be processed into MDP, i.e., poultry carcasses or parts of
carcasses chilled and maintained in accordance with 9 CFR 381.66; unchilled poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses;
and heat-treated poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses, and such carcasses or parts from which a substantial portion
of skeletal muscle or other tissue has been removed. FSIS wishes to receive comments on whether specific handling
requirements other than those being considered are appropriate for specific types of starting materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in order to avoid confusion about the parts or physical state of poultry that may be processed into MDP,
FSIS is considering providing a definition of ``poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses.'' The terms ``poultry carcasses''
or ``parts of carcasses'' would apply to whole carcasses or disjointed portions of such carcasses that are ``ready-to-cook
poultry'' within the meaning of 9 CFR 381.1(b)(44) of the poultry products inspection regulations. In other words,
the head, feet, crop, oil gland, trachea, esophagus, entrails, mature reproductive organs, and lungs of the slaughtered
poultry have been removed and such poultry is free from protruding pinfeathers and vestigial feathers and suitable
for cooking without need of further processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering that adoption of the handling requirements discussed above would eliminate the need to require
that the temperature of rooms or compartments in which equipment for mechanical deboning of raw poultry is operated
be maintained at 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F or less. Thus, if the requirements FSIS is considering are adopted, FSIS would need to rescind 9 CFR 381.47(e).

C. Tentative position: Limitations on use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS's tentative position is to establish and codify limitations with respect to use of MDP in the formulation of poultry
and meat food products. FSIS is contemplating imposing such restrictions based on the potential fluoride contribution
of MDP made from fowl (i.e., mature female chickens) and the characteristics of MDP, including the kind of poultry
from which it is made, its consistency, and its protein and fat contents. FSIS believes that such requirements are
necessary to prevent potential health and safety problems, and to maintain the quality and integrity of the poultry
and meat food product supply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Kind of product limitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering that when a poultry product is required to be prepared from a particular kind or kinds of poultry
(e.g., chickens), use of MDP of any other kind (e.g., mechanically deboned turkey) should not be permitted. This provision
would assure that MDP made from a different kind of poultry is not used in a poultry product represented as containing
ingredients from a particular kind or kinds of poultry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tentative definition and standard for MDP that FSIS is considering covers MDP prepared from any kind of poultry.
FSIS is not considering, however, to permit use of MDP as an ingredient in any given poultry product regardless of the
kind of poultry from which it is made. Such action would be inconsistent with existing regulatory requirements and
interpretations and could, among other things, result in false or misleading labeling. For example, the definition
and standard for (Kind) patties (9 CFR 381.160) requires that poultry product ingredients be ``of the kind indicated''
(e.g., turkey products in turkey patties). FSIS believes that in considering to amend the poultry products inspection
regulations to provide for the use of MDP as a distinctive poultry product ingredient, this consideration should
not abrogate this type of requirement (e.g., to permit use of mechanically deboned chicken in turkey patties).

 FSIS is considering that the use of mechanically deboned chicken made, in whole or part, from fowl (i.e., mature female
chickens, as defined in 9 CFR 381.170(a)(1)(vi)) should not be permitted in baby, junior, or toddler foods. Also,
FSIS is considering that it should not be permitted in combination with MS(S) to constitute more than 20 percent of
the livestock and poultry product portion of any other poultry product or meat food product. These restrictions are
based on the potential fluoride contribution of product made from fowl to dietary intakes. The 1979 health and safety
report found only slight differences between the fluoride content of MDP made from poultry other than fowl and that
of poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques, but considerably higher amounts in MDP made from
fowl.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that, in addition to prohibiting use of MDP made from fowl in baby (i.e., strained), junior, and toddler
foods, MDP also should be limited in other foods, because infants also consume table foods, with most eating adult-type
foods by age 2. This would limit the potential fluoride contribution to dietary intakes of other young children in
high fluoride areas. FSIS believes that MDP made from fowl should be limited to a maximum of 20 percent of the livestock
and poultry product portion of any poultry or meat food product.

Tentative position: Poultry product limitations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is considering that the use of MDP should be limited in certain poultry products. FSIS is considering allowing
MDP in the sauce portion or any dressing of poultry products and is soliciting comments on this use. FSIS is also soliciting
comments on whether MDP should be allowed in poultry products for which there are standards of identity or composition
(e.g., Boned (Kind)_Solid Pack, Boned (Kind) with Natural Juices, Shredded (Kind), (Kind) burgers, (Kind) A La Kiev
and (Kind) Steak or Fillet).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MDP is a finely comminuted ingredient and FSIS considers its use to be inconsistent with the basic characteristics
associated with poultry products that have been processed only to the extent of cutting or grinding or that are made
from poultry products so processed, such as chicken breasts, turkey fillets, and chicken burgers, or shredded chicken.
FSIS also considers its use to be inconsistent with the basic characteristics associated with poultry products that
are processed, convenience versions of ready-to-cook poultry or cuts or solid pieces of poultry or poultry meat,
such as roasted chicken, boned turkey with natural juices, chicken an la Kiev, and turkey ham. FSIS recognizes, however,
that these types of products sometimes are prepared with components the characteristics of which are not inconsistent
with those of MDP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is poultry meat_particular muscle(s)_that characterize cuts of poultry. The characteristics associated with
a cut can be retained when trimmings removed during processing are reincorporated; and the association with the cut
remains when there is chunking, chopping, or grinding of the muscle as in versions of turkey ham product (9 CFR 381.171).
FSIS regards these processes as different than using product made by the mechanical deboning of accompanying bones.
MDP does not, in FSIS's view, retain the characteristics of the cuts themselves. It appears inconsistent with the
basic characteristics expected of products represented as having been made from a particular part of the poultry
carcass, whether the muscle from that part is essentially intact or has been processed only to the extent of cutting
or grinding, to include this finely comminuted ingredient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same preparation procedures used in making a turkey ham product can be applied to other cuts, such as turkey breast,
for which definitions and standards have not been prescribed in subpart P of part 381 of the poultry products inspection
regulations (9 CFR part 381, subpart P). Cured turkey breast and turkey ham products have in common their method of
preparation and their association with a particular cut of poultry. They differ only in the cut of poultry product
used. As this difference is not relevant to whether inclusion of MDP would be appropriate, FSIS believes that use of
MDP should not be permitted in these products nor in products that are similar.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is interested in receiving comments on its views as to the products in which use of MDP or its use in anything but
sauces and dressings should be prohibited as inconsistent with their basic characteristics, including data and
other information on the effects of using MDP on the characteristics and quality of specific products. Persons who
support allowing use of MDP in any of the poultry products covered in the above discussion should be aware that FSIS
is interested in their views.

Tentative position: Limitations on product ``for processing.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering that, in addition to complying with any applicable limitations discussed with regard to the requirements
of the definitions and standards of identity or composition for particular poultry products and meat food products
(9 CFR parts 319 and 381, subpart P thereto), use of MDP ``for processing,'' i.e., MDP that has a protein content of less
than 14 percent and/or a fat content of more than 25 percent, not be permitted in the formulation of a poultry product
or meat food product at levels above 2 or 3 percent because of the effect on finished product quality. FSIS is requesting
comments regarding this approach and possible conditions for exceptions, e.g., when poultry and meat food products
are subject to a regulatory definition and standard which establishes a minimum requirement for protein content
and a maximum limit on fat content which ensure finished product quality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS also recognizes that MDP ``for processing'' may be used at very low levels (2 or 3 percent) as a binder_i.e., for
a technological or functional purpose. FSIS is particularly interested in receiving comments on whether such product
should be permitted for this purpose and, if so, in what products and under what conditions. For example, would it be
adequate and appropriate to permit this type of use so long as it is limited to the 3 percent level in formulating processed
product?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS expects to include special provisions for the labels of MDP and products in which it is used as an ingredient. If
adopted, these provisions would supplement other, more general requirements for such labels (see 9 CFR parts 317
and 381, subpart N).

Tentative position: The product. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering the following possible labeling provisions for MDP: (a) The name of the product (e.g., ``Mechanically
Separated (Kind),'' must be followed immediately by the phrase(s) ``for processing'' unless it has a protein content
of not less than 14 percent and a fat content of not more than 25 percent, ``made from fowl'' unless it is not made, in whole
or part, from mature female chickens (see 9 CFR 381.170(a)(1)(vi)), and ``with excess skin'' unless it is made from
poultry product that does not include skin in excess of the natural proportion present on the whole carcass (see 9 CFR
381.117(d)); (b) after any such required information, the name of the product may be followed by ``without skin''
and/or ``without kidneys and sex glands'' if it is made from poultry product that does not include skin and/or that
does not include kidneys or sex glands; and (c) there must be appropriate descriptive terminology if heat treatment
has been used in the preparation of such product. Because the characteristics specified are ones which would affect
use of MDP, FSIS is considering that, in order to assure compliance with regulatory requirements and thereby prevent
the adulteration and misbranding of finished poultry products and meat food products, it is necessary to provide
for their clear identification on the label when MDP leaves the establishment at which it is manufactured (see 9 CFR
381.115).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated previously, the regulations already require that information bearing on use_including deviations
from the natural whole carcass proportion of skin as well as the fact of cooking_appear on the label of mechanically
separated poultry product (9 CFR 381.117(d)). The presence of skin or its presence in excess of the natural whole carcass
proportion would, as discussed previously, continue to affect product use if the regulations are amended. The use
of heat treatment in the preparation of the product also would be of continuing relevance (9 CFR 381.157(a)). In addition,
since the presence of poultry kidneys or sex glands can affect use (9 CFR 319.180(b)), a number of manufacturers of
MDP not containing these parts currently choose to note this fact on the label. The other information that would be
required is identification of product made from fowl and product for processing.

As indicated above in the discussion of FSIS's tentative position regarding the definition and standard for MDP,
FSIS is considering that in view of the differences between MDP and poultry products produced by traditional hand-deboning
techniques and the developments since its introduction, MDP should be regulated as a distinctive ingredient with
standardized characteristics. Therefore, it is FSIS's tentative position to define such product by its own name,
e.g., ``Mechanically Separated (Kind),'' that would be declared in the ingredient statements on finished product
labels by the name specified in its definition and standard.

FSIS recognizes the importance of the identification of the calcium and cholesterol content of MDP to consumers who,
according to the comments received on the June 15, 1993, ANPR, indicated a desire to know of the presence of calcium
and cholesterol. FSIS wishes to point out that the effective date for its mandatory nutrition labeling regulations
(9 CFR 317.309, 381.409) is July 6, 1994. These rules require mandatory declaration of calcium and cholesterol content
on most processed meat and poultry products which will address this particular labeling concern. FSIS believes that
nutrition labeling is the most appropriate vehicle for conveying a product's nutrient content, which includes calcium,
cholesterol as well as other nutrient information.

FSIS is considering amending its current boneless poultry regulations to allow boneless poultry products produced

under the provisions of a quality control program that would require compliance with certain criteria for this product,
e.g., protein quality, bone solids (calcium), and bone particle size. FSIS is also considering having handling requirements
and limitations on use of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids in certain products. Further,
FSIS is considering that protein and fat content requirements would not be necessary, for such products, because
protein and fat are nutrients whose declaration becomes mandatory on the labeling of most multi-ingredient meat
and poultry products when FSIS's nutrition labeling regulations become effective on July 6, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is contemplating amending the labeling regulations on boneless poultry products to change the allowable bone
content for products currently labeled as poultry or poultry meat. The mechanical deboning machinery used to produce
boneless poultry products has undergone significant changes since 1969. Over the years, there have been continued
refinements in certain parameters, e.g., the ability to adjust the pressure and aperture size, resulting in far less
than current allowance of no more than one percent bone solids for mechanically deboned poultry. According to an August
1993 study done by FSIS
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 regarding bone content of boneless poultry products produced by mechanical deboning, the average bone solids content
was approximately 0.6 percent. The changes in mechanical deboning machinery have resulted in improved manufacturing
processes. We believe it results in products which are comparable to ``poultry'' and ``poultry meat'' derived from
hand-deboning.

FSIS is considering provisions that will enable boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids to
be classified as poultry or poultry meat and labeled accordingly. It is FSIS's tentative view that these products
need not be labeled to describe their form (i.e., consistency) by terms such as ``emulsified'' and ``finely chopped.''
FSIS believes that the form of the product may not be important because these products are primarily used as ingredients
in poultry and meat products, such as poultry sausages, which are themselves categorized as finished products that
are ``emulsified,'' ``finely chopped,'' etc., in terms of texture. Therefore, FSIS wishes to receive comments on
whether there is a need to include the term used to describe the form of the boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent
or less bone solids, e.g., ``emulsified,'' ``finely ground,'' etc., in the ingredients statement of the product
in which such product is used as an ingredient and whether these terms are important to the consumer.

Tentative position: Bone solids content.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is considering having the bone solids content of boneless poultry product with 0.6 percent or less bone solids
be measured by calcium analysis with a maximum calcium content of not more than 0.147 percent in product made from turkeys
or mature chickens or 0.111 percent in product made from other poultry. Both of these levels account for the fact that
poultry tissues, other than bone, contain some calcium and that turkeys and mature chickens contain more calcium
naturally than other poultry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering, as discussed below, that production of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone
solids under an approved quality control program is necessary to assure consistent compliance with regulatory requirements,
including the calcium content requirement utilized in restricting bone solids content.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of these calcium content levels should not be misinterpreted as indicating a concern about the amount
of the essential nutrient calcium that is provided by poultry and meat food products. FSIS considers that, even assuming
all further processed poultry were comprised of boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids, the projected
calcium contribution of such product would represent only a negligible increase in per capita daily intakes and cannot
be considered hazardous, particularly since the dietary intake of a large sector of the population may be below the
recommended level of calcium consumption. For the new boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids,
the calcium level would be significantly lower than mechanically deboned poultry.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Bone particle size.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is considering that the size of the bone particles in boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids
should be restricted to a maximum of less than 1.5 millimeter (mm) in the greatest dimension, but permitting up to 5
bone particles per 50 grams of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids to be from 1.5 mm to less
than 2.0 mm in the greatest dimension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS's objective is that the limitation imposed be adequate to prevent any digestibility problems while not restricting
the operation of equipment in accordance with the improved good manufacturing practices more than is necessary for
this purpose or to protect finished product quality. Bone particle size should be controlled to ensure that equipment
type or processing does not result in unacceptably large fragments and, provided this is done, the bone particles
in the product will not present any health hazard because of size or hardness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering that it is appropriate to permit up to 5 particles per 50 grams of product to be from 1.5 mm to less
than 2.0 mm as an acceptable defect in complying product. FSIS is requesting comments and information on the extent
to which manufacturers should be required to control the production of boneless poultry products produced by mechanical
deboning that have 0.6 percent or less bone solids to limit the size of bone particles. FSIS will consider any information
submitted during the comment period on the size and distribution of bone particles that may occur with various mechanical
deboning procedures conducted in accordance with improved good manufacturing practices (e.g., the extent to which
deviations or nonconforming particles occur, and data substantiating the absence of potential health or finished
product quality problems with such particles).

FSIS tentative: Protein quality.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is considering proposing to require that boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids meet
a minimum protein quality requirement_a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed
as a percent and to accept as evidence of compliance with this requirement an alternative measurement_the content
of 7 essential amino acids being at least 33 percent of the total of 17 amino acids present. Protein quality is a measure
of the content, proportion, and availability of essential amino acids in food protein and a measure of the ability
of the food protein to support human growth and body protein maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the regulations on MS(S) were published in 1982 (47 FR 28214), one of the methods specified for measuring protein
quality was the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) procedure. The PER method measures the ability of a protein source
to support growth in young growing rats, and is an expensive and time-consuming assay. FSIS adopted a newer method
for measuring protein quality, in order to assure the value of the protein contributed by meat and poultry to human
dietary needs, in its final regulations on nutrition labeling of meat and poultry products published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 632). The newer procedure, termed the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score
method, is contained in ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein
Quality Evaluation,'' Rome, 1990 (PDCAAS method).
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method is based on human amino acid requirements and, therefore,
is more appropriate for evaluating the protein quality of foods for human consumption than the PER which is based on
amino acid requirements of rats. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method measures the ability
of amino acids in food proteins to meet the dietary protein needs of humans.

FSIS is considering proposing a requirement that the protein in boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less
bone solids have a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than
40 expressed as a percent. This value is consistent with nutrition labeling requirements for protein in foods for
children older than one but less than four years of age, as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(7), which is cross-referenced
in its final nutrition regulations (58 CFR 632) in 9 CFR 317.309(b). FSIS believes this value protects the young consumer
from inadequate nutrition and from the use of poor quality protein (i.e., protein that does not meet the dietary needs
for growth), and in turn, protects people other than young consumers. FSIS is also considering that it is appropriate
to assure comparability of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids with poultry that is derived
by hand-deboning in terms of the protein contributed to human dietary needs to maintain the quality and integrity
of the poultry products supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing to permit an alternative measurement to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score
method, which requires a digestibility measurement in addition to an amino acid analysis, to control the cost of monitoring
compliance with the protein quality requirement. FSIS is considering proposing that, for the purpose of measuring
the protein quality of boneless poultry with 0.6 or less bone solids, an alternative measurement of protein quality
would be allowed that is comparable to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score. This measure would
be based on a comparison between the ``essential amino acid content of boneless poultry'' and ``total amino acids
present in boneless poultry.'' Essential amino acid content includes isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine,
phenylalanine, threonine, and valine content, and the total amino acids present including isoleucine, leucine,
lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine, alanine, aspartic acid,
glutamic acid, glycine, proline, serine, and hydroxyproline content. It is being considered that the essential
amino acid content would be determined by methods given in the ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO
Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids found to be in compliance by the proposed amino
acid content measurement would have protein of high quality. This belief is supported by the 1982&hyph;83 evaluation
of an Expert Work Group that was organized by the Department's Agricultural Research Service, in cooperation with
the University of Maryland, to develop recommendations based on available scientific knowledge for consideration
in policy decisions regarding the protein quality of meat, poultry, and their products.

FSIS tentative position: Protein and fat contents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is considering whether there is a need to establish minimum protein and/or maximum fat content(s) for boneless
poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids. FSIS has concluded that such action is not necessary because
protein and fat are nutrients whose declaration becomes mandatory on the labeling of most multi-ingredient meat
and poultry products upon the effective date of the nutrition labeling regulations (58 FR 632). These regulations
also establish a voluntary nutrition labeling program for single-ingredient, raw products, and specify that FSIS
will evaluate significant participation of the voluntary program. If significant participation is not found, FSIS
shall initiate rulemaking to require nutrition labeling on those products under the voluntary program. Therefore,
with certain exceptions, consumers will have complete information about the nutrients in poultry products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS recognizes that not all products sold to consumers at the retail level will carry nutrition labeling. FSIS's
final regulation on nutrition labeling provided for certain exceptions including products produced by small businesses
and products in small packages of less than 1/2 ounce net weight, provided that the labels for these products bear no
nutrition claims or nutrition information. However, labeling will be required on most processed products purchased
by consumers in retail stores so that, together with the voluntary program for retail store information on single-ingredient
raw products, consumers will have information on protein and fat for most products purchased for consumption at home.
Based on these considerations, FSIS maintains that there is no need to establish minimum protein and/or maximum fat
contents for boneless poultry products produced by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less bone solids.

Tentative position: Quality control.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS believes that a quality control program is necessary to assure that establishments that manufacture boneless
poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids comply consistently with the criteria being considered. Utilization
of such a quality control program in producing the boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids would
be a prerequisite for the approval of labels for products consisting of or containing boneless poultry. The function
of a quality control program is to restrict potential variability within the limits of FSIS's tentative requirements
by controlling the factors that can affect the resulting product's characteristics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS expects to require that boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids be produced under an approved
quality control program. Also, FSIS expects to require that the quality control program provide the controls and
information necessary to assure boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids will meet each of the requirements
under consideration and will enable establishment personnel and FSIS to monitor it for effectiveness. FSIS is focusing
on methods that will minimize inter-lot variation by maintaining the uniformity of starting materials and controlling
the handling and processing of starting materials and resulting product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because it appears that this goal can be achieved effectively and efficiently where a program for quality control
incorporates appropriate methods and monitoring techniques and adheres to good manufacturing practices, FSIS
plans to require that an establishment conduct only limited analyses for calcium, protein quality, and bone particles
for boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids to confirm that production is, in fact, under control.
After it has been demonstrated that the quality control program is able to yield complying product, confirmatory
analyses would be required only periodically, as long as the product is in compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS anticipates establishing basic parameters for the chemical analyses that must be performed to verify compliance
with the requirements, e.g., defining production lots and sampling schedules, and the accepted methodology for
performing analyses. FSIS wishes to receive comments on the parameters necessary for an adequate quality control
program.

B. Tentative position: Handling requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Current regulatory requirements, including provisions for sanitation, operating procedures, and heat processing
(9 CFR part 381, subpart H and I, and &sect;381.150), already provide the basic controls necessary to prevent spoilage
and assure poultry product wholesomeness. However, because the mechanical deboning process presents greater opportunities
for bacterial growth than traditional poultry product processing, FSIS is considering amending the poultry products
inspection regulations to more specifically address the requirements for the various starting materials used to
manufacture boneless poultry products produced by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less bone solids and the
resulting boneless poultry product.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS believes that potential bacterial hazards are diminished as long as handling accords with good manufacturing
practices. FSIS is, therefore, considering that processing and storage requirements are warranted for the raw materials
used to make the product and for the product itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering proposing handling requirements that would provide that material to be processed into boneless
poultry products produced by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less bone solids be processed within 2 hours
from the time it is separated from the bones of poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses, except that such product may
be held for no more than 72 hours at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or less, or held indefinitely a 0 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (^18 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or less. Within 2 hours of the mechanical deboning operation, FSIS is also considering proposing that boneless
poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids be chilled to 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or less, frozen to 0 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (^18 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or less, or cooked. FSIS is further considering proposing that boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone
solids be used as an ingredient in a poultry or meat food product directly after being processed, except that it may
be held prior to such use for no more than 72 hours at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or less or indefinitely at 0 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (^18 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS wishes to receive comments on whether specific handling requirements other than those being considered are
appropriate for specific types of starting materials. In addition, in order to avoid confusion about the parts or
physical state of poultry that may be processed into boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids, FSIS intends
to provide a definition of ``poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses.'' The terms ``poultry carcasses'' or ``parts
of carcasses'' would apply to whole carcasses or disjointed portions of such carcasses that are ``ready-to-cook
poultry'' within the meaning of 9 CFR 381.1(b)(44) of the poultry products inspection regulations. In other words,
the head, feet, crop, oil gland, trachea, esophagus, entrails, mature reproductive organs, and lungs of the slaughtered
poultry have been removed and such poultry is free from protruding pinfeathers and vestigial feathers and suitable
for cooking without need of further processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering that adoption of the handling requirements discussed above would eliminate the need to require
that the temperature of rooms or compartments in which equipment for mechanical deboning of raw poultry is operated
be maintained at 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. or less. Thus, if the requirements FSIS is considering are adopted, FSIS would need to rescind 9 CFR 381.47(e).

C. Tentative position: Limitations on Use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At a level of 0.6 percent or less bone solids content there is no need for consumer concern regarding potential fluoride
contribution of mechanically separated product made from fowl (i.e., mature female chickens).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) Tentative position: Kind of product limitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS's tentative position on amending the poultry products produced by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less
bone solids covers such product prepared from any kind of poultry. It is not, however, FSIS's intention to permit use
of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids as an ingredient in any given poultry product regardless
of the kind of poultry from which it is made. Such action would be inconsistent with existing regulatory requirements
and interpretations and could, among other things, result in false or misleading labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS intends to provide that when a poultry product is required to be prepared from a particular kind of kinds of poultry
(e.g., chickens), use of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids of any other kind (e.g., poultry
product made from turkey) should not be permitted. This provision would assure that boneless poultry product made
from a different kind of poultry is not used in a poultry product represented as containing ingredients from a particular
kind or kinds of poultry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) Tentative position: Limitation on product made from fowl. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the past, the Agency has had a policy of discouraging the use of MDP containing 1.0 percent or less bone solids content
for use in baby, junior, and toddler foods because of concern for higher levels of fluoride present in the bones of mature
poultry. However, FSIS believes that at the low level of 0.6 percent or less bone solids content there would be no reason
to place a restriction on boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids for use in baby, junior, and
toddler foods based on the potential fluoride contribution of product made from fowl to dietary intakes. Furthermore,
there is research to indicate a very poor absorption of fluorine from bone particles coupled with a large body of research
indicating beneficial effects of fluoride at lower levels. With the restriction of 0.6 percent or less bone solids
content, levels of fluoride present would not present a health and safety concern.

FSIS anticipates permitting the use of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids made, in whole
or part, from fowl (mature female chickens, as defined in 9 CFR 381.170(a)(1)(vi)) in baby, junior, or toddler foods.
The Agency is interested in receiving comments and supporting scientific documentation if there are valid, scientific
findings contradicting this view.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Poultry product limitations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids is comminuted, i.e., finely ground, in form,
FSIS is considering its use to be inconsistent with the basic characteristics associated with poultry products that
have been processed only to the extent of cutting or grinding or that are made from poultry products so processed, such
as chicken breasts, turkey fillets, and chicken burgers or shredded chicken. FSIS also considers its use to be inconsistent
with the basic characteristics associated with poultry products that are processed, convenience versions of ready-to-cook
poultry or cuts or solid pieces of poultry or poultry meat, such as roasted chicken, boned turkey with natural juices,
chicken a la Kiev, and turkey ham. FSIS is interested in receiving comments on its views as to the products in which use
of boneless poultry product produced by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less bone solids or its use in anything
but sauces and dressings should be prohibited as inconsistent with their basic characteristics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS's tentative position on limitations of use is intended to provide a mechanism for assuring that boneless poultry
products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids is not an ingredient in products marketed as classes or cuts of raw poultry
which have undergone additional preparation such as boning and/or cooking where regulatory standards currently
do not address their poultry or poultry meat content (e.g., boneless turkey breasts), as well as where they do.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS does not anticipate adopting any restrictions on the amount of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or
less bone solids that can be used in poultry products, or meat food products, in which it is a permitted ingredient.
However, standards for particular products may contain quantitative limits (e.g., the limit on the amount of poultry
product ingredients permitted in cooked sausages such as frankfurters and bologna (9 CFR 319.180)) or other restrictions
on the way in which various poultry product ingredients may be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Finished poultry products and meat food products. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated previously, FSIS is considering proposing that boneless poultry product with 0.6 percent or less bone
solids should be classified as ``poultry'' or ``poultry meat'' and that it should be described accordingly. Although
boneless poultry product with 0.6 percent or less bone solids is finely ground in form, it is expected that this product
would be used as an ingredient in products which are, themselves, categorized as finely ground in texture, e.g., frankfurters
and bologna. Therefore, FSIS is considering that when boneless poultry product with 0.6 percent or less bone solids
is used as ingredient in a poultry or meat product, it should be declared by terms that accurately describe it as a poultry
or poultry meat product, e.g., ``chicken'' and ``turkey meat.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS's tentative position is not to require special declaration of calcium and/or cholesterol content on labeling
of a poultry or meat food product containing boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids because
calcium and cholesterol declaration becomes necessary on the labeling of most multi-ingredient poultry and meat
products upon the effective date of FSIS's nutrition labeling regulations (58 FR 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS's tentative labeling provisions reflect FSIS's belief that nutrition labeling is the most appropriate place
for calcium and cholesterol content information by requiring that the declaration of calcium and/or cholesterol
content appear as part of any nutrition labeling that a poultry product or meat food product bears.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations by amending
the definition of meat to include as meat product resulting from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery
systems that do not crush, grind, or pulverize bones to remove attached skeletal tissue from the bones of livestock
carcasses and parts of carcasses, establishing the criteria for meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery
and meat recovery systems to assure consistency with the characteristics and composition of meat, and establishing
requirements for the handling of meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems,
as well as the material from which it is derived. This action is being taken to update the definition of meat to acknowledge
and include as meat product derived from the advances made in the modification of traditional mechanical means of
separating meat from the bones of livestock and the development of advanced recovery systems that do not involve grinding,
crushing, or pulverizing bones to remove the adhering skeletal tissue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) from imposing with respect to the premises, facilities,
and operations of federally inspected establishments any requirements that are in addition to, or different than,
those imposed under the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, impose recordkeeping and other requirements
within the scope of section 202 of the FMIA, if consistent therewith, with respect to any such federally inspected
establishment. States and local jurisdictions are also preempted under the FMIA from imposing any marking, labeling,
packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected meat products that are in addition to, or different
than, those imposed under the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction
over meat products that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of meat
products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such
an establishment, after their entry into the United States. Under the FMIA, States that maintain meat inspection
programs must impose requirements that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA. The States may, however,
impose more stringent requirements on such State inspected products and establishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No retroactive effect will be given to this rule. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5 must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule, if the challenge involves any decision of a program
official. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR part 335 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge
to the application of the provisions of this rule with respect to labeling decisions.

Effect on Small Entities

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). This rule does not require either
large or small establishments to use meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems. Although there are
initial costs involved with the purchase of machinery and establishing quality control programs, there are no apparent
direct competitive advantages that large establishments would have over small establishments.

) requires that the Secretary of Agriculture administer an inspection program that assures consumers that meat and
meat food products distributed in commerce and within designated States
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 are wholesome, not adulterated, and are properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Under the FMIA and regulations promulgated

Designated States are States that have failed to develop or are not effectively enforcing requirements at establishments,
within their jurisdiction, for the slaughter of livestock and/or the preparation of products thereof, that are at
least equal to those of subchapters I and IV of the FMIA. Once a State is designated, the provisions of subchapters I
and IV of the FMIA apply to the operations and transactions of establishments that operate solely within the State.

The part of the muscle of any cattle, sheep, swine, or goats, which is skeletal or which is found in the tongue, in the
diaphragm, in the heart, or in the esophagus, with or without the accompanying and overlying fat, and the portions
of bone, skin, sinew, nerve, and blood vessels which normally accompany the muscle tissue and which are not separated
from it in the process of dressing. It does not include the muscle found in the lips, snout, or ears. This term, as applied
to products of equines, shall have a meaning comparable to that provided in this paragraph with respect to cattle,
sheep, swine, and goats.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal meat inspection regulations also establish a definition and standard of identity for a meat food product
called ``mechanically separated (species)'' (MS(S)) in 9 CFR 319.5. ``Species'' refers to the species of livestock,
e.g., beef or pork. At various times, this product has also been called mechanically deboned meat and mechanically
processed (species) product. This meat food product is defined as ``any finely comminuted product resulting from
the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and
parts of carcasses'' and meeting the other provisions specified in 9 CFR 319.5. This provision and other provisions
in the Federal meat inspection regulations provide, among other things, for: (1) A definition and standard that classifies
MS(S) as a meat food product, (2) limitations on the amount of MS(S) that can be used in permitted products (viz., 20
percent of the livestock and poultry product portion of the product), (3) prohibitions on the use of MS(S) in certain
products (e.g., baby food), (4) limitations on certain components of MS(S), e.g., bone particle size, bone content
(measured as calcium content), protein quality, and a maximum fat content and minimum protein content, (5) requirements
for handling and for the production of MS(S) under an approved quality control program, and (6) a requirement that
MS(S) be separately identified in the ingredients statement of a meat food product (9 CFR 317.2 (c) and (f), 318.18,
319.5, and 319.6). FSIS's 1982 final rulemaking on MS(S) (47 FR 28214) indicates that the Agency determined that material
differences in the consistency and the composition of MS(S) place it outside the scope of product traditionally defined
as meat (9 CFR 301.2(rr)), and that its differences are such that it should be defined as a distinctive standardized
product. As such, it should be identified by a name that adequately differentiates it from meat, viz., MS(S). When
MS(S) is used in meat food products, it must be separately listed in the ingredients statement by its standardized
name, e.g., ``mechanically separated beef (or pork).''

FSIS is considering issues in regard to the lack of a regulatory definition and standard for certain poultry products
produced by mechanical deboning_products which are deemed to be similar to MS(S). Poultry products produced by mechanical
deboning result from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and other
tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses. Over the years, the meat and poultry industries have referred
to poultry product produced by mechanical deboning as ``mechanically deboned poultry'' and ``comminuted poultry,''
and have declared the product as poultry or poultry meat (e.g., ``chicken'' and ``turkey meat'') on the labels of products
in which they are used as ingredients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several red meat sausage manufacturers have alleged that without a regulatory definition and standard for poultry
products produced by mechanical deboning, a disparate situation exists between labeling poultry products produced
by mechanical deboning and MS(S) which poses an unfair advantage for the manufacturers of poultry products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has considered the appropriate course for addressing these issues and has initiated two actions in response
to them. FSIS is contemplating proposing regulations on poultry products produced by mechanical deboning, and will
be soliciting comments and requesting data on various tentative positions in a notice that appears elsewhere in this
issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The second action is the subject of this proposed rule which focuses on the meat product derived from the advances
in meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems that is comparable to ``meat'' as traditionally defined
in 9 CFR 301.2(rr).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS now believes that advances in meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems, which do not grind,
crush, or pulverize bone in order to remove skeletal muscle tissue adhering to bones of livestock (i.e., bones of cattle,
sheep, swine, and goats) result in a product which, unlike MS(S), is comparable to ``meat'' as traditionally defined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the 1970's, there has been increasing commercial production of processed meat products that are formulated
with comminuted (i.e., ground) meat, e.g., hot dogs, in order to meet the demands of the market for such products. Most
of the technology that has found commercial use will evolve in the form of improvements to meet the demands of consumers
and industry. The demands of the industry have centered around the desire to harvest more usable protein, i.e., muscle
tissue, and to find alternatives to recovering more usable protein, from livestock carcasses to meet consumer demands
for the processed meat products formulated with skeletal muscle tissue obtained by mechanical removal. Mechanization
also diminishes the economic implications of removing meat by hand caused by repetitive motion disorders for workers
that hand-debone carcasses and parts of carcasses using knives, and by knife accidents. Industry data
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 indicate that over 300,000 cases of cumulative trauma disorder (e.g., Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) have occurred in the
meat industry due to the strain of repetitive movements to remove meat from bones. The demands of the consumer and industry
have resulted in improvements in meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems to improve yields and,
simultaneously, to make the process better ergonomically.

Over the past decade, FSIS has monitored the tremendous strides in modernizing the meat/bone separation machinery.
FSIS believes that there are meat/bone separators and meat recovery systems that are fundamentally different than
the machines used to manufacture MS(S). These differences occur in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness of the
process of separating skeletal muscle tissue and bone.

The Removal of Muscle Tissue From Livestock Bones
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the advent of automatic means of skeletal muscle tissue removal from bone using high-speed knives, e.g., the
Wizard knife, machines that are classified as meat/bone separators have been developed that emulate the physical
action of the high-speed knives. The advances in meat/bone separation have led to recovery systems that separate
meat from bone without crushing, grinding, or pulverizing bones such that the meat is removed by shaving, pressing,
or scraping the muscle tissue from the bone surface similar to the action of the hand-held high-speed knives. Thus,
this meat is obtained in much the same manner as that which is obtained using traditional hand-deboning techniques,
where the bones emerge separately from the meat in the process, essentially intact and in natural physical conformation.
For example, the most commonly used bones would include rib bones and loin bones and would be recognized as such when
they emerge from the meat/bone separation machinery. FSIS believes that the description of the bones from which muscle
tissue has been removed as ``essentially intact'' is consistent with the description of the bones resulting from
the removal of muscle tissue by hand-deboning using knives, including high-speed mechanical knives, such as the
Wizard knife. FSIS recognizes that even with the use of hand-operated knives, e.g., in the processing establishment,
at the supermarket meat counter, or by the consumer, there is the possibility of shaving, pressing, or scraping close
to the bone surface so as to unavoidably remove a minute amount of the bone's surface when meat is removed. FSIS believes
that this is a normal occurrence because of the difficulty in exercising precision in hand-deboning operations,
and, as such, it is still in conformance with good manufacturing practices that render products safe and wholesome.
Because the bones emerge from the advanced meat/bone separators in their natural shape and structure, i.e., with
the connective tissue linkages that normally occur in bones, FSIS maintains that they are in natural physical conformation.
Furthermore, under FSIS's longstanding boneless meat inspection procedure for meat derived by hand-deboning techniques,
it is expected that the finished comminuted (i.e., ground) meat product made from the meat removed from livestock
bones contains no bone perceptible to sight or touch. This result would be expected for meat derived from the advanced
meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In contrast, the mechanism of traditional mechanical deboning machines from which MS(S) results, involves mechanically
separating and removing most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock through the application of high
pressure to crush, grind, and pulverize bones from which most of the meat has already been removed, and then using high
pressure to force the resulting paste through a sieve to separate bone particles and fragments that result from crushing
and pulverizing bones during processing. Due to the mechanism of the machinery used to manufacture MS(S), bone and
bone particles, including bone marrow, are incorporated into the finished product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation on MS(S) in 9 CFR 319.5 does not specify the type of equipment used to separate and remove bone because
it is intended to cover the product manufactured by any such machinery that operates on the differing resistance of
hard bone and soft tissue to passage through small openings, whether it employs sieves, screens, or other devices
and whether or not bones are pre-broken before being fed into such equipment. However, the regulation on MS(S) is not
intended to apply to whole pieces of muscle tissue which have been removed from livestock bones by mechanical or other
means (47 FR 28223). FSIS has determined that the consistency of MS(S) and its content of bone, including bone marrow,
and certain minerals, as well as muscle tissue, are materially different from those of ``meat,'' and that these differences
have potential consequences for finished product quality and for health and safety which are addressed by the regulations
for MS(S) (9 CFR 318.18, 319.5, and 319.6) and supported by the Agency's 1979 report on the health and safety aspects
of mechanically deboned meat.

Starting Materials
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The starting materials from which the meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems
results are intact livestock bones with adhering skeletal muscle and other soft tissue. While it has been reported
that it is possible to use whole carcasses, the raw materials for this type of processing generally are parts of carcasses
with skeletal muscle attached. Adhering skeletal muscle tissue usually varies in amount, depending on the anatomical
origin and size of the bones. Typically, the livestock bones with adhering skeletal tissue applicable to the advances
in meat recovery are those where the adhering tissue cannot be efficiently or effectively removed by traditional
hand-deboning techniques, and the bones are of sufficient hardness and of appropriate size compatible with the operation
of the advanced meat/bone separator/meat recovery system. It is FSIS's understanding that the advanced machinery
is capable of handling medium to smaller size bones, e.g., rib bones, button bones, loin bones, and feather bones.
The fact that no bone crushing, grinding, or pulverizing occurs limits the types of bones that are used. The bones must
be hard enough to emerge from the process essentially intact and in natural physical conformation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the traditional mechanical deboning process, described in the 1982 final regulations on MS(S) (47 FR 28214), it
is possible to use whole carcasses; however, generally, the raw materials for the conventional process are parts
of carcasses from which most of the skeletal muscle already has been removed by traditional hand-deboning methods.
With the mechanical deboning technology described in the regulations on MS(S), these bones are broken up and pushed
under high pressure through equipment with apertures that allow a small amount of powdered bone to pass through with
the soft tissue.

FSIS believes that the resulting product derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery
systems is comparable to meat derived by hand-deboning techniques, including the use of mechanical knives and that,
as such it warrants classification as ``meat.'' FSIS believes that current relevant Federal meat inspection regulations
on labeling meat should apply, and, as such, the ``meat'' derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and
recovery systems may be described by any term that accurately reflects it as meat. Advanced meat/bone separation
machinery and meat recovery systems apply a process mechanism that shaves, presses or scrapes adhering tissue from
the surface of livestock bones. The machines do not grind, crush, or pulverize bones to separate muscle tissue, and
the bones and the interconnecting soft tissues that link bones emerge from the process in a manner consistent with
hand-deboning operations that use knives.

Meat products derived by advanced meat/bone separation are characterized by identifiable muscle fiber structure,
visible differentiation of lean and fat, and components normally associated with and expected in meat obtained by
hand-deboning. The advanced recovery systems produce distinct whole pieces of skeletal muscle tissue with a well-defined
particulate size similar in consistency to (species) trimmings derived by hand-deboning and used to formulate processed
meat products. The color of the meat derived from these systems is similar to that of (species) trimmings.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 As such, the meat derived from the advanced recovery systems conforms to the definition of ``meat'' because it has
the functional and chemical characteristics of meat; there are no powdered bone or constituents of bone, e.g., bone
marrow, that are not in conformance with the definition and expectation of meat or that which would render the product
adulterated or misbranded under the regulations. It is FSIS's belief that, unlike MS(S), consumer expectations
of ``meat'' are met with regard to the product obtained from the advances in meat/bone separation machinery and recovery
systems, because the product's characteristics, in terms of appearance and texture, and its composition are similar
to those of ``meat,'' as currently defined in 9 CFR 301.2(rr).

In contrast, MS(S) differs from hand-deboned meat and the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation due to
its highly comminuted, spread-like consistency and its content of varying amounts of bone, including bone marrow,
and certain minerals, as well as muscle tissue. MS(S) is amorphous and lacks the characteristic components seen in
meat, e.g., muscle fiber, the presence of connective tissue fibers in the way they occur naturally, and distinct lean
and fat components. These characteristics render the product materially different than meat.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing to amend the definition of meat in the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 301.2(rr)) to include
as meat product resulting from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, establish criteria
for meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, and establish requirements for the
handling of meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, as well as the material
from which it is derived. FSIS is proposing these amendments to the Federal meat inspection regulations to update
the definition of meat to include as meat product produced from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery
systems. It is FSIS's intent to recognize that (1) substantial advances have occurred with regard to the machinery
for separating skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and parts of carcasses from livestock bones, since the promulgation
of rules on the production, use, and labeling of MS(S) and the products in which it is used as an ingredient, and that
(2) the characteristics and composition of the meat from these advances are comparable to the product traditionally
defined as ``meat.'' In proposing the amendments, FSIS continues to fulfill its statutory responsibility to prevent
the preparation and distribution in commerce of meat and meat food products which are adulterated or misbranded or
not properly marked, labeled, or packaged.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would amend the definition of ``meat'' set forth in 9 CFR 301.2(rr) of the Federal meat inspection regulations
to include as meat product, meeting certain criteria, that is derived from the mechanical separation of skeletal
muscle tissue from the bones of livestock by using advanced mechanical meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery
systems that do not crush, grind, or pulverize bones, and from which the bones emerge comparable to those resulting
from hand-deboning, i.e., essentially intact and in natural physical conformation such that they are recognizable
as loin bones, rib bones, etc., when they emerge from the machinery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously stated, FSIS believes that meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery
systems has the functional and chemical characteristics of ``meat.'' This product is also comparable to meat derived
by hand-deboning techniques, including mechanical high-speed knives. FSIS further believes that consumer expectations
of ``meat'' are met with regard to the identity of the product, because the product's characteristics, in terms of
appearance and texture, and its composition are similar to those of ``meat,'' as currently defined in 9 CFR 301.2(rr).
Therefore, FSIS is proposing to amend the definition of ``meat'' to include meat derived from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and recovery systems.

The proposal would establish protein quality and calcium content criteria for meat derived from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and meat recovery systems and assure its compliance with such criteria through a quality control
program in order to assure conformance with consumer expectations of ``meat'' and production of ``meat'' comparable
to that obtained by hand-deboning techniques. A maximum calcium content (as a measure of bone solids) of not more than
0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product (within a tolerance of 0.03 percent or 30 mg) and a minimum protein quality requirement
of a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent, or an alternative
measure of at least 33 percent essential amino acids of the total amino acids present, would be established for the
product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS has carefully considered whether there is a need to establish minimum protein and/or maximum fat content(s)
for product derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems. FSIS believes that such
action is not necessary because protein and fat are nutrients whose declaration becomes mandatory on the labeling
of most multi-ingredient meat and poultry products upon the effective date of the nutrition labeling regulations
which is July 6, 1994 (58 FR 632). These regulations also establish a voluntary nutrition labeling program for single-ingredient,
raw products, and specify that FSIS will evaluate significant participation of the voluntary program. If significant
participation is not found, FSIS shall initiate rulemaking to require nutrition labeling on those products under
the voluntary program. Therefore, with certain exceptions, consumers will have complete information about the
two nutrients in muscle meat that are the sole source of calories and are characteristic of the nutrient profile of
meat. Such information will ensure that consumers are not misled about the composition of products containing meat
obtained using advanced meat/bone separation machinery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS recognizes that not all products sold to consumers at the retail level will carry nutrition labeling. FSIS's
final regulation on nutrition labeling provided for certain exceptions, including products produced by small businesses
and products in individually wrapped packages of less than 1/2 ounce net weight, provided that the labels for these
products bear no nutrition claims or nutrition information. However, labeling will be required on most processed
products purchased by consumers in retail stores so that, together with the voluntary program for retail store information
on single-ingredient, raw products, consumers will have information on protein and fat for most products purchased
for consumption at home. Furthermore, FSIS believes that the fat and protein contents of meat derived from advanced
meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems would be comparable to the fat and protein contents of meat derived
from hand-deboning. Based on these considerations, FSIS maintains that there is no need to establish minimum protein
and/or maximum fat contents for products derived from advanced meat/bone separation and recovery systems.

FSIS is proposing to include in the amendment to the definition of ``meat,'' criteria on maximum calcium content (as

and recovery systems is both consistent with consumer expectations of ``meat,'' e.g., beef trimmings, and comparable
to ``meat,'' as traditionally defined, that is used to formulate further processed meat food products. The criteria
is a measure designed to ensure that bones are not crushed, ground, or pulverized during processing. The maximum calcium
content of 0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product is supported by data submitted to FSIS for the product derived from
advanced meat/bone separation machinery.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, based upon analytical repeatability studies conducted by the Agency for calcium, FSIS proposes to
establish a tolerance, i.e., allowance for statistical variability, of 0.03 percent or 30 mg/100 gm for individual
samples.

Protein quality. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing to require that meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems
meet a minimum protein quality requirement_a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than
40 expressed as a percent and to accept as evidence of compliance with this requirement an alternative measurement_the
content of 7 essential amino acids being at least 33 percent of the total of 17 amino acids present. Protein quality
is a measure of the content, proportion, and availability of essential amino acids in food protein and a measure of
the ability of the food protein to support human growth and body protein maintenance.

When the regulations on MS(S) were published in 1982 (47 FR 28214), one of the methods specified for measuring protein
quality was the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) procedure. The PER method measures the ability of a protein source
to support growth in young growing rats, and is an expensive and time-consuming assay. FSIS adopted a newer method
for measuring protein quality, in order to assure the value of the protein contributed by meat and poultry to human
dietary needs, in its final regulations on nutrition labeling of meat and poultry products published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 632). The newer procedure, termed the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score
method, is contained in ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein
Quality Evaluation,'' Rome, 1990.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method is based on human amino acid requirements and, therefore,
is more appropriate for evaluating the protein quality of foods for human consumption than the PER which is based on
amino acid requirements of rats. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method measures the ability
of amino acids in food proteins to meet the dietary protein needs of humans.

FSIS is proposing to require that the protein in meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation and recovery systems
have a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed
as a percent. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score would be required to be determined by methods
given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8.00 in the ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation
on Protein Quality Evaluation'' which is incorporated by reference in the proposed rule. The proposed protein digestibility-corrected
amino acid score or not less than 40 expressed as a percent is consistent with nutrition labeling requirements for
protein in foods for children older than one but less than four years of age, as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(7), which
FSIS cross-referenced in its final nutrition labeling regulations (58 FR 632) in 9 CFR 317.309(b). FSIS believes
this value protects the young consumer from inadequate nutrition from the use of poor quality protein (i.e., protein
that does not meet the dietary needs for growth) and, in turn, protects people other than young consumers. FSIS also
believes it is appropriate to assure comparability of the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation systems
with that derived by hand-deboning to maintain the quality and integrity of the meat supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing to permit an alternative measurement to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score
method, which requires a digestibility measurement in addition to an amino acid analysis, to control the cost of monitoring
compliance with the protein quality requirement. FSIS is proposing that, for the purpose of measuring the protein
quality of meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, an alternative measurement
of protein quality would be allowed that is comparable to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score.
This measure would be based on a comparison between the ``essential amino acid content of meat'' and ``total amino
acids present in meat,'' i.e., an essential amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids present
in the meat. Essential amino acid content includes isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,
and valine content, and the total amino acids present include isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine,
threonine, valine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine, alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, proline, serine,
and hydroxyproline content. The essential amino acid content would be required to be determined by methods given
in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8.00 in the ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation
on Protein Quality Evaluation'' which is incorporated by reference in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS continues to believe that meat found to be in compliance by the proposed amino acid content measurement would
have protein of high quality. This belief is supported by the 1982&hyph;83 evaluation of an Expert Work Group that
was organized by the Department's Agricultural Research Service, in cooperation with the University of Maryland,
to develop recommendations based on available scientific knowledge for consideration in policy decisions regarding
the protein quality of meat, poultry, and their products.

The public should be aware that FSIS continues to have interest in investigations of protein quality which include
among their objectives the identification of improved methods for determining protein quality. In evaluating the
possible use of alternative approaches to assuring protein quality, FSIS will consider data and other comments submitted
by the public.

Qualify control.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is proposing to require that meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems
be produced under an approved quality control program. FSIS believes quality control is necessary to assure that
establishments manufacture meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems that complies
with the provisions of the proposed amendment of the definition of meat. Utilization of such a quality control program
in producing this product would be prerequisite for the approval of labels for products consisting of or containing
meat from advanced recovery systems. In other words, an approved quality control program would be necessary prior
to the production of meat using advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The function of a quality control program would be to restrict potential deviations from the prescribed definition
of meat by controlling the factors that can affect conformance with the definition. Thus, it is proposed to require
that the quality control program provide the controls and information necessary to assure that the meat from advanced
meat/bone separation and recovery systems will meet each of the requirements of the regulations and will enable establishment
personnel and FSIS to monitor it for effectiveness. FSIS is focusing on methods that will maintain the uniformity
of starting materials and control the handling and processing of starting materials and resulting product. The methods
of analysis for calcium and protein quality that are permitted and are intended to be used should be identified in the
quality control system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the owner or operator of an establishment that intends to manufacture meat from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and recovery systems would request the Administrator of FSIS to approve the establishment's
quality control program. The procedures and criteria for receiving such requests and assessing the adequacy of programs
for quality control, as well as for terminating approval, would be those set forth in 9 CFR 318.4. These provisions
provide guidance on the development and maintenance of appropriate quality control programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that with a quality control approach to preventing noncompliance from occurring, the need for testing
the resulting product to assure compliance can be reduced and, consequently, the costs of production kept down. Moreover,
the proposed quality control requirement builds on the control and information programs that processors use to predict
and minimize the likelihood of manufacturing products that are inconsistent and of varying quality, and do not comply
with regulatory requirements. Proposing to rely on a approved quality control program, rather than continual testing
by processors, is a means for assuring that operations achieve compliance with the applicable proposed requirements
and, thereby, prevents misbranding and adulteration of the resulting meat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal of preventing misbranding and adulteration are key issues with regard to meat products produced by mechanical
meat/bone separation, and can be achieved effectively and efficiently where a program for quality control incorporates
appropriate methods and monitoring techniques, and adheres to good manufacturing practices. FSIS believes that
product exceeding the calcium limit should not be classified as meat because if it exceeds the proposed calcium limits,
it would reflect unacceptable incorporation of bone in the product during processing. To ensure that product satisfies
the calcium requirement, FSIS is proposing that a sample of at least one pound from each lot of production would be taken
and analyzed for calcium. A lot would consist of the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and
recovery systems, designated as such by the operator of the establishment or his or her agent, from the product produced
from a single species of livestock in no more than one continuous shift of up to 12 hours. The results from chemical analyses
would be compared to the requirement of 150 mg/100 gm of product within a tolerance of 0.03 percent or 30 mg. If statistical
evidence exists that product may not be in compliance, then further sampling of the product will be required to demonstrate
that the product is in compliance with requirements for meat derived from meat/bone separation and recovery systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that statistical evidence of non-compliance exists when an individual analytical result is more than
0.03 percent (i.e., 30 mg) above the requirement, i.e., greater than 0.18 percent (i.e., 180 mg). (This tolerance
is derived by equating it to three times the expected standard deviation (i.e., 0.1 percent) of the analytical procedure
used by FSIS to measure the calcium contents in samples.)

If any single analytical result is more than 0.18 percent, FSIS proposes that, before product from a production lot
that is still at the establishment or one subsequently produced can be considered to be in compliance, at least three
samples
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 from that lot must be taken and analyzed for calcium, either separately or as a composite (i.e., combining the three
samples for analysis), at the option of the establishment. The average of the results or the composite result must
comply with the requirement for calcium (i.e., less than or equal to 0.15 percent). Taking three samples from each
lost would continue until five consecutive lots
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 have mean or composite results less than or equal to 0.15 percent. Individual results or an average of results would
be rounded to the nearest 0.01 percent based on the precision of the methodology for measuring calcium. If the FSIS
program official detects any results out of compliance, the program official may undertake normal compliance procedures.

FSIS believes that, if the statistical evidence indicates that a production lot is not in compliance with the calcium
requirement, the lot must be labeled as MS(S) and meet the requirements for MS(S) in 9 CFR 319.5. In this situation,
FSIS believes that the process is out of control, and there is the likelihood that too much calcium has been incorporated
in the recovered meat, and, therefore, it should be identified as MS(S).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing that at least one pound of product be sampled each week during production of a lot for conformance
with protein quality criteria. Once three consecutive results from 3 production lots are in compliance with the criteria
on protein quality (i.e., a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score or essential amino acid content),
sampling of production lots can be reduced to a monthly basis. After 6 months, sampling of production lots can be reduced
to a quarterly basis.

A major concern of FSIS is the assurance that consumers receive the quality of meat they expect in terms of the value
of protein needed to sustain good nutrition. Therefore, FSIS is proposing that product from advanced meat/bone separation
machinery and recovery systems that does not meet the requirements of the criteria for protein quality must be identified
as ``(species) fat'' or ``(species) connective tissue,'' and labeled in accordance with the applicable provisions
in 9 CFR Part 317. Protein quality values less than the proposed criteria are comparable to those associated with ``(species)
fat'' and ``(species) connective tissue.''

Handling requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing to specify requirements for the handling of material that is to be processed into meat derived from
advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems and for handling such product. FSIS is proposing that
the handling of such material comply with the same provisions as are currently prescribed in 9 CFR 318.18 for handling
material for mechanical processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that potential bacterial hazards are diminished as long as handling accords with good manufacturing
practices. Because meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems consists of particulates
of muscle tissue having more surface area than whole muscle cuts, there is a greater potential for bacterial hazards.
FSIS has, therefore, concluded that processing and storage requirements are warranted for the raw materials used
to make the product and for the product itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing to adopt the handling requirements prescribed in 9 CFR 318.18. These requirements would provide
that material to be processed into meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems
be processed within 1 hour from the time it is cut or separated from livestock carcasses or parts of carcasses, except
that such product may be held for no more than 72 hours at 40

(a) The product resulting from the separating process shall not have a calcium content exceeding 0.15 percent or 150
mg/100 gm of product within a tolerance of 0.03 percent or 30 mg, and it shall have a protein digestibility-corrected
amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent (except as modified in paragraph (b) of this section).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An essential amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids present in the meat derived from advanced
meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems shall be accepted as evidence of compliance with the protein
quality requirement set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, essential amino acid
content includes isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine content, and
the total amino acids present include isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine,
tyrosine, arginine, histidine, alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, proline, serine, and hydroxyproline
content.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) A prerequisite for label approval for meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery
systems is that it shall have been produced by an establishment under an approved plant quality control program. The
Administrator shall receive, evaluate, and approve requests for plant quality control in accordance with &sect;318.4(d)
(1) and (2) and (e). Such a plant quality control system shall provide the controls and information necessary to assure
that the product will meet the requirements described in &sect;301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter and will enable establishment
personnel and program employees to monitor the system for effectiveness. The system shall include a written description
of the methods used by the establishment to maintain uniformity of the raw ingredients used in manufacturing the product
and to control the handling and processing of the raw ingredients and the finished product, and shall contain provisions
for chemical analyses of the product and other procedures to determine and assure compliance with the definition
of the product. For purposes of this paragraph, a lot shall consist of the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation
machinery and recovery systems, designated as such by the operator of the establishment or his or her agent, from the
product produced from a single species of livestock in no more than one continuous shift of up to 12 hours. All units
of any lot must be available for inspection by program employees. The plant quality control program shall be subject
to periodic review, and the approval of such program may be terminated in accordance with &sect;318.4(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To verify the calcium content in meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems,
an analysis of a sample of at least one pound from each lot shall be performed by the operator of the establishment or
his or her agent. Individual results from the chemical analyses shall be compared to the calcium limit, prescribed
in paragraph (a) of this section, in order to demonstrate compliance. If compliance is not demonstrated, that is,
if any single analytical result is more than 0.18%,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 before product from a production lot that is still at the establishment or one that is subsequently produced can be
considered to be in compliance, at least three samples from that production lot shall be taken and analyzed for calcium,
either separately, or, at the option of the establishment, as a composite (i.e., combining the three samples for analysis).
The average of the results or the composite result must be less than or equal to 0.15%. Taking three samples from each
subsequently produced lot and analyzing them in order to demonstrate compliance shall continue until five consecutive
lots have mean or composite results less than or equal to 0.15%. If the statistical evidence indicates that a production
lot is not in compliance with the calcium limit, as prescribed in &sect;301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter, the lot must
be labeled as MS(S) and meet all of the requirements for MS(S) in &sect;319.5 of this subchapter.

The value 0.18% was derived by multiplying by 3 the expected analytical standard deviation obtained by FSIS laboratories
on the approved chemical procedure for measuring calcium which uses Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as
provided in the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International'' (formerly the Association of Official
Analytical Chemists), 15th Ed. (1990).

(2) To verify the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score or the essential amino acid content in meat derived
from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, an analysis of a sample of at least one pound shall
be performed by the operator of the establishment or his or her agency each week during production of a lot to assure
that product will meet the requirements of &sect;301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter. Once three consecutive results
from three production lots are in compliance with the criteria on protein quality (i.e., a protein digestibility-corrected
amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent, as reflected in paragraph (a) of this section or an essential
amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids present, as reflected in paragraph (b) of this section),
sampling of production lots can be reduced to a monthly basis. After 6 months, sampling of production lots can be reduced
to a quarterly basis. Subsequently, if samples are out of compliance, sampling each week would be repeated until three
consecutive results from three production lots are in compliance. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid
score and the essential amino acid content shall be determined by methods given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8.00
in ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,''
Rome, 1990. The ``Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation'' as published by
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization is incorporated as it exists
on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)
and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from the Division of Nutrition, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition
(HFF&hyph;260), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204. It is also available for inspection
at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. Product resulting from
the separating process which fails to meet the protein quality requirement in &sect;301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter,
shall be labeled as ``(Species) fat'' or ``(Species) connective tissue.''

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to analyze and disclose the environmental
effects of watershed and fisheries restoration activities in Sheppard and Griffin Creeks and their tributaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for this proposal stems from vegetative conditions that have deteriorated due to insect and weather events
and will have slow recovery if no action is taken. Current watershed and fisheries conditions do not fully support
cold-water fisheries and aquatic life. These conditions, taken in combination with the vegetative conditions,
will persist in the long-term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the project is to restore watershed and fisheries conditions in Sheppard and Griffin Creeks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposals's actions to regenerate predominantly dead lodgepole pine stands and wind damaged stands, construct
temporary roads and recondition roads necessary to access these stands, correct chronic sediment sources primarily
by rehabilitation of roads not needed for future land management activities, remove sediment from stream pools,
and stabilize stream channels are being considered together because they represent either connected or cumulative
actions as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR 1508.25).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This EIS will tier to the Flathead National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and EIS of January, 1986,
which provide overall guidance of all land management activities on the Flathead National Forest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extensive scoping has been done for this project during the initial stages of preparation of an Environmental Assessment,
and during the analysis of alternatives over the past fourteen months. The Forest Service has determined that an EIS
will be prepared for this project. The Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State, and
local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may now be interested in or affected by the proposed actions.
These comments will be used in preparing the Draft EIS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The need of the proposal is a result of a mountain pine beetle outbreak which has caused significant mortality and stands
damaged by an intense storm which caused significant blowdown. In both conditions, if no action is taken, regeneration
of conifers would occur slowly over several decades. This slow rate of vegetative recovery would result in slow recovery
of watershed and fisheries conditions. Also, several chronic sources of sediment in Sheppard and Griffin Creeks
are causing degradation of cold-water fisheries. Sections of many of the tributaries of Sheppard and Griffin Creeks
are deficient in woody debris and native shrubs which is important in stabilizing stream channels and protecting
fisheries habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposal is to restore watershed and fisheries conditions by a variety of management practices
where existing conditions are not fully supporting identified beneficial uses of cold-water fisheries and aquatic
life. Specifically, the purpose is to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Accelerate regeneration of conifer species in stands with high amounts of lodgepole pine mortality caused by
mountain pine beetle and in stands with significant amounts of blowdown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reduce chronic sediment sources in Sheppard and Griffin Creeks and their tributaries by rehabilitation and revegetation
of existing roads.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Improve fisheries habitat by sediment removal from pools.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Stabilize stream channels lacking woody debris and native shrubs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Conduct management practices in a manner to provide economic opportunity and to provide a timber supply to the
local lumber manufacturing industry.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regeneration of primarily dead lodgepole pine stands is proposed on approximately 1520 acres, regeneration of wind
damaged stands on approximately 115 acres, maintenance and minor intermittent reconditioning of approximately
55 miles of existing roads, construction of approximately 5 miles of temporary roads, rehabilitation of 13 miles
of roads, placement of large woody debris intermittently in 39 miles of streamcourses, native shrub planting on approximately
55 acres and sediment removal at 15 sites in Sheppard, Griffin and Squaw Meadows Creeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to be made is what, if anything, should be done in the Sheppard-Griffin area to: (a) Accelerate regeneration
of primarily dead lodgepole pine stands and wind damaged mixed conifer stands, (b) rehabilitate sediment sources
that are primarily roads not needed for long-term management, (c) stabilize stream channels by placement of large
woody debris and planting native shrubs to reduce the erosive power of streamflow during peak flows, and (d) improve
fisheries habitat by sediment removal from pools.

The LRMP for the Flathead National Forest provides the overall guidance for management activities in the potentially
affected area through its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most areas of proposed management activities for the Sheppard-Griffin project are within Management Area (MA) 15.
Some activity is also planned in MA 17. Management Area 15 consists of lands where timber management with roads is economical
and feasible. The management goal is to manage these lands for the long-term growth and production of commercially
valuable wood products, as well as provide for soil and water protection, wildlife habitat, and roaded recreation
opportunities. Management Area 17 includes adjacent forested riparian lands. The primary goal is to protect and
maintain this riparian zone, including fish and wildlife habitat, while maintaining a sustained yield of timber.
The proposal is designed to meet the Forest Plan standards and guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public participation has occurred at various times during the analysis. Initially, scoping was done separately
for the Sheppard project and the Griffin project, in November of 1991, and May of 1992, respectively. Since that time,
the two projects have been combined into one analysis based on similarities in purpose, issues and close proximity.
Two additional periods of time are identified for the receipt of comments on the analysis. One period will be during
the 45 days after this notice is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and another during the 45-day review and comment period of the Draft EIS. Scoping at the local level has already commenced.
If comments have been submitted, there is no need for additional comment. No public meetings are scheduled at this
time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on public scoping the following issues have been identified: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) There is concern how the vegetation restoration may affect wildlife, particularly big game species such as elk,
deer and moose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Road construction and management are a concern because of the potential impact to water quality, wildlife and
fisheries habitat and recreation use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Harvest methods used in vegetative restoration are a concern to many people, especially in regard to fragmentation
of a forested landscape. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) There is a concern that vegetative restoration may result in further adverse effects on watershed and fisheries
values.

The analysis is essentially complete and has included a full range of alternatives that respond to issues received
from scoping over the past year. One of these is the ``no-action'' alternative, in which no management activities
would take place. As a result of the scoping and analysis that has taken place to date, alternatives to the proposed
action would include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Restoration of chronic sediment sources and unstable stream channels only. No restoration of dead lodgepole
pine stands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Modify the proposed action to use existing roads only. No restoration of lodgepole pine stands in the drainages
containing the most unstable stream channels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Modify the proposed action to emphasize big-game habitat effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Modify the proposed vegetative treatments to minimize fragmentation of old-growth management indicator species
habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will document the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Past, present
and reasonable foreseeable actions on both private and National Forest lands will be considered. The EIS will disclose
the site-specific features that reduce or eliminate potential environmental impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review
in May, 1994. At that time the EPA will publish a notice of availability of the draft EIS in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The public comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA's notice of availability appears in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage because of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact stage but that are not raised

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when the agency can meaningfully consider them, and respond to them
in the final environmental impact statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following this comment period, the comments received will be analyzed, considered and responded to by the Forest
Service in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS). The FEIS is scheduled to be completed by July 1994. Joel
Holtrop, Forest Supervisor, Flathead National Forest, 1935 Third Avenue East, Kalispell, MT 59901, is the responsible
official for the preparation of the EIS and will make a decision regarding this proposal considering the comments
and responses, environmental consequences discussed in the FEIS, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies.
The decision and rationale for the decision will be documented in a Record of Decision. That decision will be subject
to appeal under applicable Forest Service regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicates that the project will not cause significant
local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, Lynn A. Brown, State Conservationist,
has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement is not needed for this project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project purposes are watershed protection and flood prevention. The planned works of improvement include the
construction of approximately 400 feet of channel that connects previously installed channels. The proposed project
is part of the East Side Green River Watershed Project started in 1966. The P&hyph;1 connecting channel is part of the
remaining segments to be installed according to the plan. The proposed project will have a low flow channel in the main
channel. The low flow channel will have a 12-foot bottom width and the main channel, including the low flow channel,
will be 65 feet wide. This proposed channel will be constructed adjacent to the existing natural drainage way. The
natural drainage way will be managed as a wetland and wildlife area. It will share some of the flows with the proposed
channel during high runoff periods. Trees, scrubs, and grass will be established in the wetland area and all disturbed
areas of the proposed channel. These plantings will provide food and cover for small birds and mammals in addition
to erosion control and bank stabilization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fish habitat components consist of placing several groups of boulders and root wads from trees to provide habitat
for resting areas, hiding areas, and will diversify the path of the water flow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Notice of a Finding Of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency
and to various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are
available to fill single copy requests at the above address. Basic data developed during the environmental assessment
are on file and may be reviewed by contacting Frank R. Easter, Assistant State Conservationist (Programs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No administrative action on implementation of the proposal will be taken until 30 days after the date of this publication
in the

The survey is required in order to classify, by industry, information collected on related forms for U.S. direct investment
abroad (i.e., Forms BE&hyph;577, BE&hyph;133B, and BE&hyph;133C). These data are needed, by country and industry,
for compiling the quarterly direct investment estimates included in the U.S. international transactions and gross
national product accounts, for annual estimates of the U.S. direct investment position abroad, and for semi-annual
estimates of property, plant, and equipment expenditures of majority-owned foreign affiliates. They are also needed
to measure the economic significance of U.S. direct investment abroad, monitor changes in such investments, analyze
its effect on the U.S. and foreign economies, and based upon this assessment, make informed policy decisions regarding
U.S. investment abroad.

Commerce operates approximately 24 research ships. In contracts for constructing and maintaining these ships,
the contractor must have certain kinds of insurance. This insurance is necessary to protect the multi-million dollar
ships and the interests of the U.S. taxpayers. The information collected is used to verify that the contractor has
acquired the levels of insurance necessary to protect the interests of the Government.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with Title 13, United States Code, sections 131, 182, 224, and 225, I have determined that 1993 operating
revenue and expenses are needed for the telephone, radio and television broadcasting, cable and pay television,
and other communication services industries to provide a sound statistical basis for the formation of policy by various
governmental agencies, and that these data also apply to a variety of public and business needs. These data are not
publicly available from nongovernment or other governmental sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Census Bureau is authorized to conduct surveys necessary to furnish current data on subjects covered by the major
censuses authorized by Title 13, United States Code. This survey will provide continuing and timely national statistical
data on communication services for the period between economic censuses. The latest economic census was conducted
in 1992. The data collected in this survey will be within the general scope and nature of those inquiries covered in
the economic censuses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of the Census needs reports only from a limited sample of communication firms in the United States. The probability
of a firm's selection is based on payroll size. The sample will provide, with measurable reliability, national level
statistics on operating revenue and expenses for these industries. We will mail report forms to the firms covered
by this survey and require their submission within thirty days after receipt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This survey has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB approval control number 0607&hyph;0706
in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Public Law 96&hyph;511, as amended. We will provide copies of the
forms upon written request to the Director, Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the 1993 Annual Meeting of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ICCAT), the United States announced that it would undertake a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peer review of the scientific basis of management of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fisheries for Atlantic bluefin tuna. To ensure that the review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is independent and unbiased, NOAA has asked the NRC to undertake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a technical review of this subject. In order to prepare for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994 Annual Meeting of ICCAT, the NRC has been asked to complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an approved report of its review by June 30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NOAA has given the NRC the following general questions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the review to address: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are the current Standing Committee on Research and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statistics (SCRS) assessments of the status of eastern and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
western Atlantic bluefin the most valid interpretation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the available data? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Is uncertainty in the assessments adequately expressed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What is the status of the Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative to the Convention's goal of managing tuna to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve maximum sustainable yield? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Does the available information support treating bluefin tuna 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as separate eastern and western management units (i.e., how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much mixing is likely and is it enough to invalidate two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate management units)? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA has stated that the list of questions should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered preliminary. It has requested that the NRC provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to receive the views of the public and that the list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of issues addressed be refined and, if necessary, expanded based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on that input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this notice, NMFS is soliciting comments on any matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that pertain to the peer review. All comments received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closing date will be forwarded to the NRC for its consideration.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
DLA has been directed to establish a reserve of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) to ensure that supplies for mission-critical
uses will be available. An environmental assessment has been prepared to address the proposed strategy for establishing
the ODS Reserve, possible alternative approaches, environmental consequences of the proposed action, and measures
recommended to mitigate potentially adverse effects. This environmental assessment has been prepared in accordance
with Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations and DLA implementing regulation DLAR 1000.22, Environmental
Consideration in DLA Actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action involves the establishment of a Defense Reserve to support mission-critical requirements for
CFC refrigerants and halon fire extinguishing agents. CFC solvents may be maintained in the Reserve if requirements
are fully justified. Although the Reserve may receive deposits from all sources within the DoD, material will be issued
only to mission-critical systems and users as identified to the DLA by the Military Services. The establishment of
the Reserve will give DoD the capability to centrally receive, recontainerize, recycle and reclaim ODS. This reclamation
capability will be established at the Defense Distribution Depot Richmond, Virginia, which already has extensive
operations involving compressed gas receipt, storage, and distribution and cylinder refurnishment. The Reserve
will be located within structures currently used for cylinder storage and refurbishment and will require no new construction.
DLA will institute a variety of safeguards including personnel training, equipment upgrades, and leak detection
programs to maintain the inventory and avoid unnecessary emissions. Reserve operations will not require air emission,
water discharge, or hazardous waste management permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DLA will manage inventory levels in order to ensure that excess quantities of materials are not maintained in the Reserve
and will phase out materials when no longer needed for mission-critical purposes. Any excess will be disposed of in
compliance with environmental regulatory requirements. New purchases of ODS will be necessary in order to establish
inventories at levels which can be sustained through recovery and reclamation. The quantity of new ODS purchases
will be validated in coordination with the DoD Inspector General. The total quantity of ODS expected to be acquired
for the initial establishment of the Reserve will be less than the average quantity of ODS purchased annually by DoD
in recent years. Specific measures have been identified in the assessment to mitigate potentially adverse effects
which might occur during establishment or operation of the Reserve. The establishment of a Reserve and the initiation
of central recovery, recycling and reclamation operations will allow DoD to conserve ODS inventories, maintain
mission-critical systems which are dependent on ODS, and avoid the need for an exemption to the production phase out
pursuant to Section 604(f) of the Clean Air Act Amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment of a defense Reserve for mission-critical ODS is not considered a major action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment or requiring the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. A public
comment period regarding the environmental assessment will begin at the time of publication of this notice and will
conclude 30 days following. Copies of the environmental assessment are available for inspection at the address listed
above.

The action being taken is a feasibility investigation to identify and assess potential measures to provide additional
flood protection for the study area including the cities of Coalinga and Huron, Lemoore Naval Air Station, surrounding
agricultural land, and the California Aqueduct, and to prevent sediment and water contaminated with asbestos from
entering the aqueduct. The feasibility investigation area includes the Arroyo Pasajero basin in southwest Fresno
County. Measures to be investigated include enlarging the retention basin west of the aqueduct, constructing an
overchute structure, upstream reservoirs, conducting local levee and channel work, and implementing an asbestos
hazard abatement treatment.

Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Corps of Engineers, and a non-Federal sponsor (California State Department of Water Resources) are conducting
a feasibility investigation to identify and assess alternative measures for providing additional flood protection
to the cities of Coalinga and Huron, to Lemoore Naval Air Station, to the California Aqueduct, and to agricultural
lands, and for preventing sediment and water contaminated with asbestos from entering the aqueduct. In 1958 and 1969
major flooding occurred in the area causing over $5 million in property loss.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The feasibility report and EIS will address the full range of alternatives discussed in the 1992 reconnaissance report
on the basin including evaluation of plans to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Enlarge the retention basin west of the California Aqueduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provide an overchute structure over the aqueduct or an aqueduct canal siphon and provide a retention basin on the
east side of the aqueduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Construct a channel from the aqueduct and/or the retention basin to a natural channel at the valley trough. Also
included will be an evaluation of upstream reservoirs, local levees and channel work, the potential for groundwater
injection, potential water treatment methods to permit Arroyo Pasajero runoff into the aqueduct, special asbestos

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is considering an application for section 404 and section 10 permits to conduct dredge
and fill activities at Bolsa Chica near the City of Huntington Beach, Orange County, California. The proposed project
incorporates components of residential housing and associated infrastructure, habitat restoration of the estuarine
marsh, and modifications to the existing East Garden Grove-Wintersburg Flood Control Channel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary Federal concern is the dredging and discharging of materials within waters of the United States, including
wetlands, and potential significant impacts on the human environment. Therefore, in accordance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Corps is requiring the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
prior to consideration of any permit action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project Site
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Bolsa Chica site consists of approximately 1,973 acres of land located in northwestern coastal Orange in southern
California. Of the total acreage, approximately 1,312 acres consists of lowlands situated between two upland mesas
(Bolsa Chica Mesa to the north and Huntington Mesa to the south).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The site is surrounded by residential neighborhoods to the north, east, and southeast, and by the Pacific Coast Highway
(State Route 1) and Bolsa Chica State Beach to the southwest. At present the site is largely undeveloped and is traversed
by numerous compacted dirt berm roads associated with ongoing oil production activities. A 300-acre State Ecological
Reserve, of which 170 acres have been restored, is also located in the Bolsa Chica lowland adjacent to Pacific Coast
Highway.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In February 1989, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency determined that 927 acres of waters of the United States,
including wetlands, are present at the site. Approximately 916 acres are the subject of the applicant's permit request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The applicant's proposed project is comprised of three primary components:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Construction of residential housing and associated infrastructure on approximately 270 acres of the Bolsa Chica
Mesa as well as approximately 194 acres of the lowlands (comprised of 119 acres of wetlands and/or waters of the U.S.
and 75 non-jurisdictional acres adjacent to existing homes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Consolidation and restoration of degraded wetlands and creation of new wetlands from on site non-jurisdictional
areas;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Modifications to the existing East Garden Grove-Wintersburg Flood Control Channel. The proposed wetlands restoration
work includes the construction of a new non-navigable tidal inlet beneath Pacific Coast Highway and through Bolsa
Chica State Beach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permit application states that completion of the residential construction component in the lowlands will enable
the landowner to finance and complete the wetlands restoration component.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Potentially significant environmental issues associated with implementation of the applicant's proposed project
to be addressed in the EIS include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Geological issues including subsidence, seismic concerns and landform alteration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Impacts to terrestrial and aquatic biological resources, including Federally listed threatened and endangered
species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Impacts to surface and ground water quality and hydrology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Impacts to prehistoric and historic cultural resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Land use patterns, including recreation and coastal access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Impacts to air quality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Noise impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Impacts to public services and utilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Impacts to aesthetic resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Oceanography and fishing impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Impacts to local traffic circulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. Socioeconomic concerns including population, housing and infrastructure costs and benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
m. Public health and safety concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
n. Cumulative impacts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The EIS will consider an appropriate range of alternatives for the proposed project at Bolsa Chica. For purposes of
this analysis, separate alternatives will be analyzed for each of the plan's three primary components, keeping in
mind the overall project purpose. Because the applicant proposes to develop the Bolsa Chica Mesa regardless of any
action in the lowlands, the following applies primarily to the applicant's permit application for that portion of
the project in the lowlands. Accordingly, the following list of alternatives is set for in three categories: (I) Residential
housing; (II) wetlands restoration; and (III) flood control modifications.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
I. Residential Housing Component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. Residential housing and associated road construction on 119 acres of degraded wetlands and 75 non-jurisdictional
acres along the inland edge of the site (Applicant's Preferred Action). The applicant contends that this alternative
will provide it with sufficient usable property in the lowland to enable it to restore and convey in perpetuity the
balance of its lowland holdings (approximately 767 acres) to the County of Orange. This conveyed property would be
restored by the applicant in accordance with one of the restoration alternatives listed in Section II below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Residential development and construction of a navigable ocean entrance and public marina with associated commercial
uses. Like alternative I.1, this alternative is intended to enable the applicant to restore and convey the remainder
of the lowland to the County of Orange. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Residential development in the areas known as the Bolsa Pocket and Edward's Thumb. The Bolsa Pocket is an area situated
between the East Garden Grove-Wintersburg Flood Control Channel and the base of the Bolsa Chica mesa. Edward's Thumb
is an area situated in the northeast corner of the lowland. Like alternative I.1, this alternative is intended to enable
the applicant to restore and convey the remainder of the lowland to the County of Orange. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Creation of wetlands mitigation bank in the lowland with no lowland residential development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Acquisition of the lowland by a public entity or a non-profit organization and restoration by same in accordance
with one of the restoration alternatives listed in Section II below. This alternative will be analyzed with and without
the development of a public parkland area along the inland edge of the site. In either case, there would be no lowland
residential development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. No action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Wetlands Restoration Component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. Full tidal restoration with construction of a non-navigable tidal inlet (Applicant's Preferred Action). This
alternative includes the removal of many of the roads and oil drilling pads that traverse the Bolsa Chica lowland and
requires significant excavation and discharge of fill in the central portion of the lowland in order to create a suitable
tidal prism for enhancement of the ecosystem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Muted tidal restoration without construction of a tidal inlet. This alternative differs in significant respects
from alternative II.1 in that it would rely on an increased tidal exchange from the adjoining Huntington Harbour instead
of the non-navigable inlet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Minimal restoration without increased tidal action either from Huntington Harbor or from a new tidal inlet. The
roads and drilling pads that traverse the lowland would largely be left intact. New water sources to the lowland would
be created by breaching the California department of Fish and Game levee and the Freeman Creek corridor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. No action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
III. Flood Control Modifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. Modifications to the East Garden Grove-Wintersburg Flood Control Channel that involve removing approximately
1.2 acres of embankment dirt for purposes of widening the existing channel and discharge flow into the lowland area.
(Applicant's Preferred Action). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Modifications to the flood control channel that involve excavating the Outer Bolsa Bay at the channel outlet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. No action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
IV. Plan Packages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Based on a preliminary review of a reasonable range of alternatives, the following plan packages have been identified
for a more comprehensive review in the EIS. All of the following include residential development on the Bolsa Chica
Mesa. It is anticipated that the final design may encompass one or more of the components described in sections I, II,
and III, but not necessarily as described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Applicant's Preferred Action: Residential development in the lowlands adjacent to the existing homes (I.1);
full tidal restoration (II.1); in-channel flood control modifications (III.1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Residential development in the Bolsa Pocket and Edward's Thumb areas (I.3); minimal wetlands restoration (II.3);
flood control modifications involving Outer Bolsa Bay (III.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Acquisition and restoration of the lowland by a public agency or nonprofit organization (I.5); muted tidal restoration
(II.2); flood control modifications involving Outer Bolsa Bay (III.2). This alternative will be analyzed with and
without the development of a public parkland area in the lowlands adjacent to the existing homes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Creation of a wetlands mitigation bank (I.4); full tidal restoration (II.1); in-channel flood control modifications
(III.1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Residential development and creation of a public marina with a navigable ocean entrance (I.2); full tidal restoration
(II.1); in-channel flood control modifications (III.1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. No action (I.6); no action (II.4); no action (III.3).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project area includes those floodplain areas that would be affected by a recurrence of the April 1977 flood within
the Levisa and Russell Forks of the Big Sandy River Basin in Kentucky and Virginia. These floodplain areas extend from
the confluence of Indian Creek and Russell Fork in Dickerson County, Virginia downstream on the Russell Fork to the
confluence of the Russell Fork and Levisa Fork at Millard, Kentucky (a distance of approximately 50 miles) and from
the downstream extent of the incorporated limits of the Town of Grundy, Virginia on the Levisa Fork to Louisa, Kentucky
a distance of approximately 138 miles (excluding the area included within the Government property boundary of the
Fishtrap Lake project in Pike County, Kentucky). Also included are the floodplain areas located along tributaries
of the Russell and Levisa Forks that would be affected by backwater flooding from a recurrence of the April 1977 flood
including mainstream and tributaries a total of approximately 220 stream miles are being investigated under the
study. Approximately 4,500 structures are located within the floodplain areas being investigated under this study.

2. Components of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of five (5) project alternatives have been formulated for reducing flood related damages in the Levisa Fork
Basin. These five alternatives will be further studied under the authority of Section 202 of the Energy and Water Resources
Development Appropriations Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;367) to determine the most cost-effective method of reducing
flood related damages in the basin. Project alternatives being evaluated under this study include a flood control
dam with permanent pool located approximately 4.6 miles upstream from the Town of Haysi, Virginia on the Russell Fork,
a ``dry'' flood control dam (no permanent pool) located approximately 4.6 miles upstream from the Town of Haysi, Virginia
on the Russell Fork, voluntary nonstructural measures (floodproofing by raising structures in-place, ringwalls
or veneer walls or permanent relocation of floodplain structures to flood-safe sites), no action and a flood control
dam with permanent pool located approximately 4.6 miles upstream of the Town of Haysi, Virginia on the Russell Fork,
that would include seasonal storage to facilitate downstream whitewater recreation uses in the Breaks of the Russell
Fork. Flood warning and emergency evacuation systems will be included for all floodplain areas where nonstructural
measures are proposed.

will continue throughout the development of the DEIS in the form of workshops and information furnished to the local
media. Federal, State, and local agencies, as well as, other affected and concerned organizations will be notified
of all scheduled meetings through published notices in local newspapers and direct notification with concerned
parties.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nebraska Energy Office (NEO) administers the program plan and grant for the Governors' Ethanol Coalition (GEC)
consisting of nineteen states (IL, AR, NE, CO, HI, IN, IA, KS, KY, MI, MN, MO, MT, NM, ND, OH, SD, TX, WN). The GEC has requested
funding for development, producing and distributing of a document entitled the ``Clean Fuels Book'' as a resource
for educational organizations, legislators, policy makers, media, financial and other institutions interested
in the clean fuels subject.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This award recognizes the need to assist states in adopting alternative fuels in transportation markets and accelerating
the implementation of EPACT '92 activities. The results from the activity accomplished will be shared with the participating
GEC states and DOE for replication in other states and projects. Due to their prior experience the GEC is uniquely qualified
to continue the efforts associated with their assigned tasks. The grant application is being accepted because DOE
knows of no other opportunity to conduct such a program by any other organization or entity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project period for the grant award is 12 months and is expected to begin in March 1994. DOE plans to provide funding
in the amount of $25,000 for this effort.

Licensee proposes to raise project's reservoir level by 2 feet during winter months. This would be accomplished by
replacing an existing 3-ft-high flashboards with 5-ft-high hinged flashboards on two sections of the project's
dam, and by installing a 5-ft-high rubber dam on a third section of the dam. License is requesting the amendment to alleviate
winter ice problems, which is affecting the project's electrical generation.

Take notice that on January 7, 1994, Black Marlin Pipeline Company (Black Marlin), requests approval to continue
filing a FERC Form No. 2&hyph;A: Annual Report of Nonmajor Natural Gas Companies (Form 2A), even though Black Marlin's
volumes transported for a fee now meet the criteria of a major natural gas company which would require the filing of
a FERC Form No. 2: Annual Report of Major Natural Gas Companies (Form 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Black Marlin states that it believes the information provided on the Form 2A is sufficient, because: (1) Recent incremental
volumes transported by the Company are primarily on behalf of an intrastate pipeline and, (2) additional Form 2 reporting
and independent audit requirements would require extensive resources disproportionate to any benefits gained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR Sections
385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before
March 4, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but
will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public
reference room.

On the date listed in the appendix, the licensee for the project named in the appendix, filed an application for a new
or subsequent license pursuant to the Federal Power Act (FPA) and the Commission's regulations thereunder. The location
of each project is also listed in the appendix.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The license for each named project was issued for a period ending December 31, 1993. Section 15(a)(1) of the FPA, 16
U.S.C. 808(a)(1), requires the Commission, at the expiration of a license term, to issue from year to year an annual
license to the then licensee under the terms and conditions of the prior license until a new license is issued, or the
project is otherwise disposed of as provided in Section 15 or any other applicable section of the FPA. If the project's
prior license waived the applicability of section 15 of the FPA, then, based on section 9(b) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 558(c), and as set forth at 18 CFR 16.21(a), if the licensee of such project has filed an application
for a subsequent license, the licensee may continue to operate the project in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the license after the minor or minor part license expires, until the Commission acts on its application. If the licensee
of such a project has not filed an application for a subsequent license, then it may be required, pursuant to 18 CFR 16.21(b),
to continue project operations until the Commission issues someone else a license for the project or otherwise orders
disposition of the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the project is subject to section 15 of the FPA, notice is hereby given that an annual license for each of the projects
listed in the appendix is issued to the licensee for a period effective January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994,
or until the issuance of a new license for the project or other disposition under the FPA, whichever comes first. If
issuance of a new license (or other disposition) does not take place on or before December 31, 1994, notice is hereby
given that, pursuant to 18 CFR 16.18(c), an annual license under section 15(a)(1) of the FPA is renewed automatically
without further order or notice by the Commission, unless the Commission orders otherwise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the project is not subject to section 15 of the FPA, notice is hereby given that the licensee is authorized to continue
operation of the project until such time as the Commission acts on its application for subsequent license.

Take notice that on February 18, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) petitioned the Commission
for an order declaring that Columbia's interest obligation with respect to the funds which Columbia has held in trust
for its customers and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in a restricted investment arrangement (RIA) is to pay its customers
and GRI the interest actually earned on those funds. Columbia states that the funds consist of (i) certain refund amounts
received by Columbia from its upstream pipeline suppliers; and (ii) certain surcharges collected by Columbia on
behalf of GRI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously ordered by the Bankruptcy Court and the Commission, Columbia states that it has deposited in the RIA
(i) approximately $131.2 million in upstream pipeline supplier order No. 528 refunds received after Columbia's
filing for bankruptcy on July 31, 1991 (post-petition); (ii) approximately $11.7 million in other upstream pipeline
supplier refunds also received post-petition; and (iii) approximately $1 million in post-petition GRI collections.
Columbia states that these funds were escrowed pending the outcome of litigation as to whether the funds are property
of Columbia's bankruptcy estate or are held in trust by Columbia for its customers and GRI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia requests that the Commission issue an order declaring that Columbia's interest obligation with regard
to the funds deposited and held in the RIA is to pay to its customers and GRI the interest actually earned on such funds,
and not the interest rate prescribed by the Commission's regulation at 18 CFR 154.102(c)(2) (1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia states that the filing has been served on Columbia's current customers, affected state commissions and
public interest agencies, and the Gas Research Institute.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal

Take notice that on February 24, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue,
SE., Charleston, West Virginia 25314&hyph;1599, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;252&hyph;000 an application pursuant
to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction
and operation of certain natural gas facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia states that to ensure reliable operation of its pipeline facilities, Columbia has initiated a program to
install pig launching and receiving facilities in segments of its existing storage fields which, in certain storage
fields, would result in the need to replace short segments of pipeline to provide for a uniform pipe size between launchers
and receivers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of this program, Columbia says that it proposes to construct and operate approximately 0.8 mile of 16-inch
pipeline to replace approximately 0.8 mile of 6-, 8-, 10-, 12- and 16-inch pipeline on its Line SL&hyph;2709, a bidirectional
launcher and receiver, as well as various appurtenant facilities, located in Columbia's Medina Storage Field, Medina
County, Ohio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia states that it does not request authorization for any new or additional service. Columbia further states
that the estimated cost of the proposed construction is $686,400 and would be financed with funds generated from internal
sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before March 14,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene
is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of
such hearing will be duly given. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On the date listed in the appendix, the licensee for the project named in the appendix, filed an application for a new
or subsequent license pursuant to the Federal Power Act (FPA) and the Commission's regulations thereunder. The location
of each project is also listed in the appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The license for each named project was issued for a period ending December 31, 1993. Section 15(a)(1) of the FPA, 16
U.S.C. 808(a)(1), requires the Commission, at the expiration of a license term, to issue from year to year an annual
license to the then licensee under the terms and conditions of the prior license until a new license is issued, or the
project is otherwise disposed of as provided in section 15 or any other applicable section of the FPA. If the project's
prior license waived the applicability of section 15 of the FPA, then, based on section 9(b) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 558(c), and as set forth at 18 CFR 16.21(a), if the licensee of such project has filed an application
for a subsequent license, the licensee may continue to operate the project in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the license after the minor or minor part license expires, until the Commission acts on its application. If the licensee
of such a project has not filed an application for a subsequent license, then it may be required, pursuant to 18 CFR 16.21(b),
to continue project operations until the Commission issues someone else a license for the project or otherwise orders
disposition of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the project is subject to section 15 of the FPA, notice is hereby given that an annual license for each of the projects
listed in the appendix is issued to the licensee for a period effective January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994,
or until the issuance of a new license for the project or other disposition under the FPA, whichever comes first. If
issuance of a new license (or other disposition) does not take place on or before December 31, 1994, notice is hereby
given that, pursuant to 18 CFR 16.18(c), an annual license under section 15(a)(1) of the FPA is renewed automatically
without further order or notice by the Commission, unless the Commission orders otherwise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the project is not subject to section 15 of the FPA, notice is hereby given that the licensee is authorized to continue
operation of the project until such time as the Commission acts on its application for subsequent license.

Take notice that on February 22, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing to become part of
its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets listed on Appendix A of the filing, with
an effective date of April 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGT states that on June 16, 1993 FGT filed, pursuant to Rule 602 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure
a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (Settlement) resolving all issues in these proceedings except curtailment
issues. On September 17, 1993, the Commission issued its Second Order on Compliance Filing and First Order on Rehearing
(September 17 Order) finding that the Settlement with modifications as directed therein implemented the fundamental
concepts underlying Order No. 636. The September 17 Order accepted the Settlement and approved the accompanying
tariff sheets, with certain exceptions and modifications, directed FGT to refile final tariff sheets, and accepted
such tariff sheets to be effective on October 1, 1993. Various parties requested rehearing of certain aspects of the
September 17 Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 23, 1993, FGT filed its Third Revised Volume No. 1 which reflected the revisions required by the Commission's
September 17 Order. The proposed effective date of the tariff was October 1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to a motion filed September 7, 1993, by Peoples Gas System, Inc., on September 24, 1993, the Commission
issued an order delaying implementation of FGT's Order No. 636 tariff until November 1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 16, 1993, the Commission issued its Third Order on Compliance Filing and Second Order on Rehearing granting
in part and denying in part the various requests for rehearing of the September 17 Order and directing FGT to make certain
additional changes to its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1. On January 18, 1994, FGT filed tariff sheets
reflecting the changes in compliance with the December 16 Order. The instant filing proposes certain additional
changes to FGT's FERC Gas Tariff, generally to correct minor errors and clarify certain provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 in accordance with Sections 385.211
and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before March
4, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

On the date listed in the appendix, the licensee for the project named in the appendix, filed an application for a new
or subsequent license pursuant to the Federal Power Act (FPA) and the Commission's regulations thereunder. The location
of each project is also listed in the appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The license for each named project was issued for a period ending December 31, 1993. Section 15(a)(1) of the FPA, 16
U.S.C. 808(a)(1), requires the Commission, at the expiration of a license term, to issue from year to year an annual
license to the then licensee under the terms and conditions of the prior license until a new license is issued, or the
project is otherwise disposed of as provided in section 15 or any other applicable section of the FPA. If the project's
prior license waived the applicability of section 15 of the FPA, then, based on section 9(b) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 558(c), and as set forth at 18 CFR 16.21(a), if the licensee of such project has filed an application
for a subsequent license, the licensee may continue to operate the project in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the license after the minor or minor part license expires, until the Commission acts on its application. If the licensee
of such a project has not filed an application for a subsequent license, then it may be required, pursuant to 18 CFR 16.21(b),
to continue project operations until the Commission issues someone else a license for the project or otherwise orders
disposition of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the project is subject to section 15 of the FPA, notice is hereby given that an annual license for each of the projects
listed in the appendix is issued to the licensee for a period effective January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994,
or until the issuance of a new license for the project or other disposition under the FPA, whichever comes first. If
issuance of a new license (or other disposition) does not take place on or before December 31, 1994, notice is hereby
given that, pursuant to 18 CFR 16.18(c), an annual license under section 15(a)(1) of the FPA is renewed automatically
without further order or notice by the Commission, unless the Commission orders otherwise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the project is not subject to section 15 of the FPA, notice is hereby given that the licensee is authorized to continue
operation of the project until such time as the Commission acts on its application for subsequent license.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency is announcing the commencement of operation of the Allowance Tracking System
(ATS) on March 14, 1994. As of that date, EPA will record transfers of allowances between accounts in the ATS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Subpart C of 40 CFR part 73 directs EPA to establish an allowance tracking system for the allocation, transfer, and
use of SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions allowances, as required by section 403(b) of the Clean Air Act. Section 403(b) specifically provides that
allowance transfers are not effective, for purposes of compliance with the allowance holding requirements of the
Acid Rain Program, until EPA receives and records a written certification of the transfer signed by a responsible
official of each party to the transfer (e.g., a completed Allowance Transfer form). Subpart D of 40 CFR part 73 establishes
the procedure by which EPA will record transfers of allowances to and from accounts established within the ATS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An ATS unit account has been established for each utility unit that was allocated allowances under 40 CFR 73.10 (58
FR 15634, March 23, 1993) and general accounts have been established for those who have submitted an Allowance Account
Information form. Allowances allocated to each unit as well as any allowances that were purchased at the 1993 EPA allowance
auctions have been assigned unique serial numbers and placed in the appropriate unit and general accounts. ATS does
not currently contain any additional allowances to which a utility may be entitled, such as those associated with
Phase I compliance plans, the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve, Early Reduction Credits, and Phase I Extension.
These additional allowances will be placed in the appropriate ATS accounts later this year, when the next version
of ATS is completed.

 This notice announces EPA's intent to enter into cooperative agreements with states and territories which provide
financial assistance for purposes of developing and carrying out authorized accreditation and certification programs
for professionals engaged in lead-based paint activities pursuant to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), as
amended by Title IV of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992. EPA also intends to enter into
cooperative agreements with federally-recognized Indian governing bodies to provide financial assistance for
the development of similar accreditation and certification programs. The notice describes eligible activities,
application procedures and requirements, and funding criteria. EPA anticipates that a minimum of $11,200,000 will
be available during federal fiscal year 1994 (FY94) for awards to eligible recipients. There are no matching share
requirements for this assistance. Subject to future budget limitations, EPA plans to provide this support on a continuing
multi-year or program basis. All cooperative agreements will be administered by the appropriate EPA regional office.
The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number assigned to this new program is 66.707.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 TSCA section 404(g) authorizes EPA to award non-matching grants to states and territories to develop and carry out
authorized programs for the accreditation of training programs for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities,
and the certification of contractors engaged in lead-based paint activities. To achieve authorization under Title
IV of TSCA, programs must: (1) Be as protective of human health and the environment as the federal program established
under TSCA section 402 or 406, or both, and (2) provide adequate enforcement. For states and territories that fail
to obtain authorization within 2 years following promulgation of TSCA section 402 or 406 regulations, EPA must, by
such date, administer and enforce a program for TSCA section 402 or 406. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Title IV of TSCA, EPA encourages states and territories to develop accreditation and certification programs
for lead-based paint activities. EPA therefore recommends that eligible parties seek funding through the TSCA section
404(g) assistance program, which is now being implemented to help achieve these ends. EPA further recommends that
eligible parties plan to utilize this grant support in a way that complements any related financial assistance they
may receive from other federal sources, most notably funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD). EPA will, however, seek to ensure that all federally-funded lead activities are undertaken in a coordinated
fashion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that forthcoming regulations mandated under sections 402 and 404 of TSCA will address the eligibility
of federally-recognized Indian governing bodies to receive assistance under TSCA section 404(g). Until such time
as these regulations are published, EPA intends to enter into cooperative agreements with Indian governing bodies
pursuant to section 10(a) of TSCA for the development of programs similar to those funded under TSCA section 404(g).
As a result, unless otherwise indicated, when used in this notice the term ``states'' includes Indian governing bodies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will work with prospective applicants to develop cooperative agreements which promote a variety of objectives
deemed critical to the success of its national lead program. These include: (1) Permitting flexible approaches to
reducing lead hazards, (2) developing a nationwide pool of qualified lead abatement professionals, (3) encouraging
pollution prevention in lead-based paint activities, (4) promoting environmental justice in the reduction of lead
exposures and the prevention of lead poisoning, (5) fostering the establishment of comprehensive and integrated
lead management programs by states, territories and Indian governing bodies, and (6) promoting reciprocity among
authorized programs in the training and certification of lead abatement professionals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All states are eligible to apply for and receive assistance under section 404(g) of TSCA. The term ``state,'' for purposes
of eligibility, refers broadly to any state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Canal Zone, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other territory
or possession of the United States. Federally-recognized Indian governing bodies are eligible to apply for and receive
assistance under section 10(a) of TSCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``TSCA Title IV State Lead Grants Program'' is a financial assistance program administered by EPA under authority
of TSCA section 404(g). EPA plans to award all funds to Indian governing bodies under authority of TSCA section 10(a)
during the first-year award cycle (FY94). Each of EPA's 10 regional administrators will be delegated the authority
to enter into cooperative agreements with eligible states and Indian governing bodies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Activities to be Funded Under Cooperative Agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that when TSCA Title IV was enacted on October 28, 1992, states had widely varying capabilities for
addressing lead hazards. Individual states will eventually fall within one of three broad categories of program
development: (1) States without lead programs, (2) states with programs that are likely to qualify for authorization
under TSCA section 402 that may need assistance in carrying out these programs, and (3) states with lead programs that
will require modification before qualifying for authorization. Each state's need for assistance will vary, in part,
according to the level of lead program development the state has attained. The type of program activity a given state
seeks to pursue may also vary in a corresponding manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA generally supports all state activities aimed at developing or carrying out authorized state lead programs,
the Agency does recognize certain priorities. Because few states currently have programs which parallel the forthcoming
TSCA sections 402 and 406 standards, EPA's highest priority will be to support the development of new state programs.
A second priority will be to support the continued implementation of existing state programs which are working toward
timely authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although these priorities do not constitute the Agency's criteria for award determinations, EPA will consider these
items in its cooperative agreement negotiations with applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has established three general funding categories that reflect the different status, or levels, of state lead
program development. These are: (1) Level One - Develop New State Programs, (2) Level Two - Carry Out Authorized State
Programs, and (3) Level Three - Carry Out Existing State Programs Which Do Not Yet Qualify For Authorization Under
Title IV. Because the regulations required under TSCA sections 402 and 404 which would define the criteria for obtaining
program authorization have not yet been promulgated, however, activities in only two of the three funding categories,
Level One and Level Three, will be eligible for funding consideration during the FY94 award cycle. Activities in Level
Two can only be considered after the TSCA sections 402/404 regulations have taken effect. Numerous examples of activities
considered to be eligible for funding are described in a separate EPA publication entitled ``Fiscal 1994 TSCA Title
IV Cooperative Agreement Guidance'' (January 1994) (the ``grant guidance''). Copies of the grant guidance may be
obtained through any of EPA's 10 regional offices at the addresses listed under Unit VI of this notice. It is important
to note, however, that the examples presented in the guidance are not exhaustive, and applicants are not limited in
their proposals to the listed tasks. Individual state program innovations are eligible and encouraged, so long as
the proposed tasks relate to the purposes set forth in TSCA section 404(g) and fit within the Level One or Three funding
category. These two funding categories are not mutually exclusive, and it is permissible for a state's work plan to
combine elements from each. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Selection Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the FY94 award cycle, EPA expects a minimum of $11,200,000 to be available for distribution to eligible applicants.
The Agency will use a two-tiered system to allocate these funds. This system is aimed at achieving the broadest possible
state participation, while at the same time, targeting areas with the greatest potential lead hazard and risk. It
accomplishes this by providing for a tier-one distribution of ``base funding,'' followed by a tier-two distribution
of ``formula funding,'' where additional funds are distributed based upon the relative lead burden estimated to
exist within a state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each state (excluding territories and federally-recognized Indian governing bodies) that submits a qualifying
proposal will be entitled to a base funding allotment of $100,000. In addition, base funding of up to $50,000 will be
reserved for each of the five ``territories'' (used generically in this context) that have been administratively
assigned to an EPA regional office and that have historically participated in EPA toxics cooperative agreement programs.
These ``base'' territories include the U.S. Virgin Islands (Region 2), the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Region 2),
the District of Columbia (Region 3), Guam (Region 9) and American Samoa (Region 9). The two remaining ``non-base''
territories, the Canal Zone and the Northern Mariana Islands, are also eligible to apply for funding up to $50,000
apiece, but are not considered in determining the base funding allotments. Base allotments are primarily intended
to ensure that those states and base territories wishing to pursue authorization under TSCA section 404 will be guaranteed
a minimum level of funding for this purpose. The maximum amount of base funding set-aside in FY94 will be $5,250,000.
Any unsubscribed base funding will be added to the formula funds pool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once base funding allotments have been reserved for all eligible applicants, remaining funds will be treated as ``formula
funds.'' Before applying the lead burden formula, however, EPA will subtract from the formula account an amount not
to exceed $50,000 for each Indian governing body and non-base territory not otherwise factored into the base funding
apportionment. EPA cannot reliably predict the level of participation from Indian governing bodies and non-base
territories; therefore, where these eligible parties do apply for funds, they will be assigned to an appropriate
regional office for administrative oversight, and that regional office will become responsible for determining
the appropriate level of funding. These parties, however, will not receive a formula ranking, and will not be eligible
to compete for additional formula allocations based upon lead burden calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a third step, states and base territories with funding requirements exceeding their base allotments will then
be apportioned additional sums based upon their relative lead burden. In calculating lead burden for the formula
rankings, EPA used readily available data derived from the 1990 Census of Population and Housing, together with other
data from HUD. The formula uses four factors to generate an estimate of the potential lead problem, or ``lead burden,''
in each state. Two of these factors, the number of housing units with lead-based paint and the number of children under
age 7, express the potential magnitude of the lead problem. The remaining two factors, the fraction of young children
in poverty and the fraction of low-income housing units with lead-based paint, express the potential severity of
the problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining formula rankings, each state and base territory is scored independently for each factor, and the four
individual factor scores for the state or base territory are then summed to obtain an overall score for that state or
base territory (a combined factor score). The combined factor scores of all states and base territories applying
for formula funds (or amounts in excess of their base allotment) are then summed, and the percentage of the total sum
represented by the individual state's or base territory's score is then identified. When the total formula funding
available is then multiplied by the percentage score of an individual state or territory, the state's or base territory's
ceiling formula allotment can be obtained. For example, assume that: (1) All 50 states but none of the base territories
apply for formula allotments, (2) state X has a percentage score of 2 percent, and (3) a total of $4,000,000 in formula
funding is available. In determining how much money to allot to state X, EPA would multiply $4,000,000 by .02. The product,
$80,000, represents the maximum additional funding that could be awarded to state X to supplement its base allocation.
State X would then qualify for up to $180,000 in total funding for the fiscal year ($100,000 in base funding + $80,000
in formula funding). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the maximum, or ceiling, formula allotments will fluctuate inversely with the number of applicants.
The greater the number of applicants, the lower the ceiling will tend to be, and vice versa. Formula allotments will
be determined only after the annual application deadline has passed and EPA has full knowledge of the total amount
of funds requested. If one or more states or base territories request formula fund amounts below their ceiling allotments,
residual formula funds will be available. Where this situation develops, if there are still other states or base territories
with unfunded needs, the formula will be run again. This procedure can be repeated until all formula funds have been
fully allotted. The FY94 combined factor scores for each state and base territory, derived from the census data, are
presented in the grant guidance along with a technical appendix (Appendix A) which explains the formula methodology
in greater detail.

V. Submission Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be considered for funding, each application must include, at a minimum, the following forms and certifications
which are contained in EPA's ``Application Kit for Assistance'': (1) Standard Form 424 (Application for Federal
Assistance), (2) EPA Form 5700&hyph;48 (Procurement Certification), (3) Drug-Free Workplace Certification,
(4) Debarment and Suspension Certification, (5) Disclosure of Lobbying Activities, and (6) a return mailing address.
In addition to these standard forms, each application must also include a work program, a detailed line-item budget
with sufficient information to clearly justify costs, a list of work products or deliverables, and a schedule for
their completion. Work programs are to be negotiated between applicants and their EPA regional offices to ensure
that both EPA and state priorities can be addressed. In addition, every application from a state, territory or Indian
governing body must clearly demonstrate how the proposed activities will lead to that state's pursuit of authorization.
Finally, any applicant proposing the collection of environmentally related measurements or data generation must
adequately address the requirements of 40 CFR 31.45 relating to quality assurance/quality control. These requirements
are more specifically outlined in the ``Guidance Document for the Preparation of Quality Assurance Project Plans''
(May 1993) published by EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. This document, as well as the application
kits referred to above, may be obtained from EPA's regional offices.

VI. Application Procedures and Schedule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications must be submitted to the appropriate EPA regional office in duplicate; one copy to the regional lead
program branch and the other to the regional grants management branch. Early consultations are recommended between
prospective applicants and their EPA regional offices. Because TSCA Title IV cooperative agreements will be administered
at the regional level, these consultations can be critical to the ultimate success of a state's project or program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Imagent

 GI (perflubron) is indicated for oral use with magnetic resonance imaging to enhance delineation of the bowel in order
to distinguish it from adjacent organs and areas of suspected pathology. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent
and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for Imagent
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 GI (U.S. Patent No. 3,975,512) from the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois, and the Patent and Trademark
Office requested FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. FDA, in
a letter dated September 23, 1993, advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone
a regulatory review period and that the approval of Imagent
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 GI represented the first commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Imagent
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 GI is 7,493 days. Of this time, 6,469 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while
1,024 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: February 8, 1973. The applicant claims February 9, 1973, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND)
became effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was February 8, 1973, which was 30 days
after FDA's receipt of the IND. 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: October 25, 1990. The applicant claims June 18, 1990, as the date the new drug application (NDA) for Imagent
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 GI (NDA 20&hyph;091) was initially submitted. FDA refused to file this application and notified the applicant of
this fact by a letter dated August 16, 1990. The completed NDA 20&hyph;091 was resubmitted on October 25, 1990, the
initially submitted date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was approved
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: August 13, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20&hyph;091 was approved on August 13, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 730 days of patent term
extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before May 2, 1994, submit to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before August 30, 1994, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41&hyph;42, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For animal drug products,
the testing phase begins on the earlier date when either a major environmental effects test was initiated for the drug
or when an exemption under section 512(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective and runs until
the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the animal
drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion of a regulatory

the effectiveness of CDBG funds in promoting the development of microenterprises [Section 807(C)(4)]. This report
is due to Congress the end of April, 1994 (within eighteen months after date of enactment of the Act). The report is to
contain not only an analysis of the effectiveness of the use of CDBG funds in promoting the development of microenterprises,
but a review of any statutory or regulatory provisions that impede such development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of information available with the Department of Housing and Urban Development indicates that insufficient
information is available to effectively respond to Congress' request. Two survey instruments have been prepared
to be administered via telephone to the entire universe of CDBG grantees (both entitlements and states) and to a purposive
sample of microenterprise intermediary organizations. This survey approach is expected to provide useful and usable
data regarding both entities that fund microenterprises and those that do not as well as provide greater insights
into an existing statutory and/or regulatory impediments.

Supporting Statement for Collection of Information Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Microenterprise
Report
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Part A. Justification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Circumstances That Make the Collection of Information Necessary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 807(c)(4) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 requires the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) to submit to Congress a report on the effectiveness of the use of CDBG funds in promoting development
of microenterprises, including a review of any statutory or regulatory provision that impedes their development.
A microenterprise is defined by the 1992 Act to be a commercial enterprise that has five or fewer employees, one or more
of whom owns the enterprise. HUD does not require grantees to report on the size of the businesses receiving CDBG assistance
and thus has only very limited information currently available on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Purpose and Use of the Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This survey is being undertaken in an effort to provide HUD with current, relevant information regarding the actual
experiences of community and economic development practitioners in this area for the Department's consideration
in the preparation of the required report to Congress. Such information will contribute to a more accurate appraisal
of microenterprise activities. If the survey is not conducted, the report to Congress will clearly fail to fully address
all relevant statutory or regulatory provisions that serve to impede the effective use of CDBG funds for microenterprise
activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Use of Information Technology to Reduce Burden
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD computerized files of Grantee Performance Report (GPR) data had been used to determine a potential sampling frame
of grantees for the survey. However, the information provided only limited facts that indicated a sampling frame
of grantees would not provide adequate information for the report to Congress. In order to respond most effectively
to the intent of the report, HUD needs information on grantees that fund microenterprises, those which do not and what,
if any, impediments exist. The GPR data is not a reliable basis for providing this data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Efforts to Identify Duplication
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Efforts have been made to identify possible duplication and avoid it by reviewing GPR data files and information available
in reports by interest groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Availability of Similar Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no systematic and uniform source of information about the effectiveness of CDBG assistance in promoting
the development of microenterprises, nor about any existing statutory or regulatory impediments. Information
on type of grantee (state, urban county, unit of general local government) and size of 1993 entitlement grant can be
obtained through HUD's existing data base. Other than that, however, and as stated above, GPR data files provide limited
information. They are most useful in identifying grantees that are making small dollar-value CDBG loans or grants
to for-profit businesses. Such information suggests that these activities are to assist microenterprises. The
GPR files do not, however, provide much qualitative information regarding the nature of the activities or any statutory
or regulatory impediments that the respective grantees had to overcome in designing such activities. Reports prepared
by microenterprise interest groups provide some information of this type, but it is limited. Perceived statutory
or regulatory impediments identified by some of these entities need to be corroborated by obtaining information
from actual practitioners.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Effort To Minimize the Burden for Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the information collection does not involve small entities. Some of the nonprofit intermediary organizations
responding to the survey, however, may have small staffs. Efforts have been made to minimize the burden for such entities
in the following ways:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. By making this a one-time information-collection effort;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. By collecting the data through telephone interviews, rather than self-administered questionnaires. The survey
is expected to take less than 30 minutes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. By designing the survey in a manner that will not require retrieving detailed activity information from case files
or performing extensive calculations or analysis of data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall purpose of the survey is to provide HUD with the most current, relevant information so that its required
report to Congress may best address any impediments to using CDBG funds for the development of microenterprises.
The input of small entities should serve to provide invaluable input as to any existing statutory and/or regulatory
barriers that would serve to benefit all microenterprises.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Consequence of Less Frequent Information Collection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a one-time collection of information. Therefore, less frequent collection of data is not an issue.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed data collection plan is consistent with the guidelines set forth in 5 CFR 1320.6 (Controlling Paperwork
Burdens on the Public_General Information Collection Guidelines). There are no circumstances that require deviation
from these guidelines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has discussed the type of information to be obtained through the survey with the National Community Development
Association at the NCDA Legislative Conference on January 18, 1993. NCDA represents CDBG entitlement grantees.

10. Assurances of Confidentiality
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The data requested is not considered to be of a confidential nature. No data on individual CDBG grantees or intermediary
organizations will be made available outside the agency without the prior written consent of the appropriate party.
The report to Congress will analyze and aggregate the data received and will not include identifiers linking back
to individuals.

HUD will analyze the information obtained through the surveys to determine common issues and problems encountered
by community and economic development practitioners in undertaking microenterprise activities with CDBG funds.
Data will be analyzed by grantee type, regional identity and size of grant in determining if common issues and problems
exist. HUD will rely on the evaluation of the survey data in preparing its required report to Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming approval from OMB is received no later than March 15, 1994, the surveys would be mailed no later than March
18, 1994. The follow-up telephone survey is expected to begin March 24 and be completed no later than April 6, 1994.
Analysis of the data and preparation of the report, pursuant to Section 807(c)(4) of the 1992 Act, would be completed
by April 29, 1994 and forwarded to Congress thereafter.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two target populations are of interest to this survey: CDBG grantees and microenterprise intermediary organizations.
The data collection approach employs two, statistical methods: A universe of 897 CDBG grantees (states and entitlements)
and a purposive sample of 20 microenterprise intermediary organizations. Telephone interviews for this group of
917 will be attempted and it is expected that 807 grantee and 18 intermediary organization interviews will be completed
for a 90% response rate.

Universe/Sample Stratification and Selection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD intends to survey all CDBG grantees because of the need to have information on grantees that fund microenterprise
organizations and those that do not; there is no sampling frame that provides this information prior to conducting
the survey. For instance, if a sample of CDBG grantees was drawn and the survey indicated that few of these grantees
funded microenterprises, it would provide little information to permit an analysis of the effectiveness of the use
of CDBG funds in promoting the development of microenterprises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A purposive sample of 20 intermediary organizations will be selected from those listed in the 1992 Association for
Enterprise Opportunity Membership Directory. The sample will be selected on the basis of type of intermediary organization
(cooperatives/non-profit enterprises, enterprise development organizations, financial intermediaries, and
technical assistance providers/consultants) and geographic region to help ensure that the selected sample offers
representation and variability on these characteristics.

Assuming a 90% response rate from grantees and that nonresponse is random, the grantee survey will yield very good
estimates even if the proportion of grantees who fund microenterprises is small. The sample of intermediary organizations
is not a statistical sample.

Section 807(c)(4) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (``1992 Act'') requires the Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to submit to Congress a report on the effectiveness of the use of Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) funds in promoting development of microenterprises, including a review of any statutory or regulatory
provision that impedes their development. This survey is being undertaken in an effort to provide HUD with current,
relevant information regarding the actual experiences of community and economic development practitioners in
this area for the Department's consideration in the preparation of the required report to Congress. Your participation
is voluntary, but failure to respond will hurt HUD's ability to report accurately to Congress on the nature and extent
of microenterprise activity in the CDBG program. Therefore, your participation is greatly appreciated.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice informs the public that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has submitted to OMB, for expedited
processing, an information collection package with respect to two guide formats which specify the components of
a legal opinion required by the Department in connection with the insurance of mortgage loans upon multifamily rental
projects and health care facilities under Title II of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1702, et seq. or in connection
with the making of a capital advance under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, as amended, and section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez
National Affordable Housing Act, as amended, for supportive housing for the elderly and supportive housing for persons
with disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The guide clearly articulates those matters upon which HUD requires an opinion from private counsel as well as those
matters upon which confirmations are required. The guide also contains detailed instructions pertaining to the
form as well as a format for certifications by the mortgagor as to matters particularly within the knowledge of the
mortgagor upon which its legal counsel relies in rendering the opinion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section 202 and 811 programs currently have an OMB-approved Owner's Attorney's Closing Opinion, form HUD&hyph;90166&hyph;CA
(2502:0470). However, the Department has decided that it would be beneficial to participants and their counsel to
have similar formats for all loan and capital advance programs. The section 202 and 811 guide format is essentially
the same as the insured loan format except for some differences in terminology and program requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that the new guides represent any ``collection of information,'' the process is necessary to ensure
the Department that the attorney representing the mortgagor or owner has followed the otherwise specified requirements
of the Department and to ensure the Department that the attorney has exercised an acceptable degree of due diligence
in representing the client and in rendering the opinion to the mortgagee and HUD. The extent of due diligence expected
to be performed under the guide is not substantially different from what HUD had anticipated under Form 1725 or Form
HUD&hyph;90166&hyph;CA or from what qualified counsel, in fact, perform in conventional financing transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has submitted the proposal for the collection of information, as described below, to OMB for review,
as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35);

1. Under the various sections of Title II of the National Housing Act, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) is authorizing to insure mortgage loans upon certain multifamily rental housing projects
and health care facilities (nursing homes, extended care facilities, board and care homes and hospitals). Under
section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, as amended, and section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing
Act, as amended, the Secretary of HUD is authorized to make capital advance for supportive housing for the elderly
and supportive housing for persons with disabilities. Generally, the mortgages are defined as those ``commonly
given'' in the various States; therefore, State and local law govern virtually the entire mortgage insurance transaction
from the formation of the mortgagor entity to the making and securitization of the loan to the construction of the project
is accord with local law. Consequently, prior to the making of a capital advance or endorsement of a mortgage note for
insurance in connection with a multifamily rental project or a health care facility, it is imperative that HUD know
the precise legal status of the mortgagor entity and of the realty and personalty which will comprise the security
property. Inasmuch as the transaction is largely coordinated by the counsel to the mortgagor or owner (in the case
of the section 202 and 811 programs), HUD has looked to such counsel for an opinion which provides comfort to the insured
mortgagee and HUD regarding virtually all legal aspects of the transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24 CFR 200.150 provides the regulatory authority for the collection of ``all supporting documents'' and ``other
exhibits as required by the terms of the commitment'' once the conditions of the commitment for mortgage insurance
have been met and the mortgage note is presented for endorsement by HUD. Similarly, 24 CFR 889.415 and 890.415 provide
the regulatory authority for the requirements prior to initial closing and the preparation of the necessary documents
including the attorney's opinion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it is unclear that the rendering of a legal opinion is within the ambit of ``the collection of information,''
HUD has determined that the more conservative approach is to treat the opinion as such and let OMB make a definitive
determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The opinion is designed to provide HUD and the mortgagee with assurance that the mortgagor or owner entity has been
validly formed, lawfully exists and that the security property and the construction thereupon comply with appropriate
local laws such as building codes, zoning, etc. Further, the loan documents must comport with local law and practice
and only an attorney licensed in the jurisdiction can complete such documents and provide HUD with the requisite assurance.
It would be an enormous burden for HUD and the mortgagee, which often is a national entity, to perform such a legal analysis
of the mortgagor or owner entity, the documents and the transaction. It is clear that without the assurance provide
by the opinion, HUD and the mortgagee would be performing duplicative legal work and would extend considerably greater
time and resources than the mortgagor's or owner's counsel, who would be conducting the analysis as a matter of course
in representing the client/mortgagor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. None_The form passes from counsel to the mortgagor or owner to HUD and the mortgagee. We are not aware of any new technology
which could be employed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Since this is the only legal opinion required by HUD in connection with the transaction, we can find no evidence of
duplication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Only counsel for the mortgagor or owner is in a position to render the necessary opinion. HUD counsel do not have access
to the mortgagor or owner entity in a fashion that would provide HUD counsel with all of the data and knowledge available
to the mortgagor's or owner's counsel. Further, HUD counsel are not in a time management or bar membership position
to legally opine as to organizations, real and personal property, local law, etc. which comprise a mortgage loan transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. HUD generally requires that the mortgagor or owner entity be a sole asset entity and sometimes the HUD-approved
mortgagee might also be a small business; however, no burden falls upon these entities. The entire burden is upon the
counsel to the mortgagor or owner to represent its client in the mortgage loan transaction. A small portion of such
representation involves rendering a legal opinion which can be relied upon by HUD and the mortgagee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Not applicable_The legal opinion, if collected at all, has to be collected prior to endorsement of the mortgage
note by HUD. In the case of capital advances, the legal opinion has to be collected prior to initial closing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Not applicable_It is questionable whether obtaining a legal opinion is really a collection of information.

9. An effort was made to consult with other federal governmental agencies involved in mortgage loans, state and local
entities involved in HUD's mortgage insurance programs, trade organizations, attorneys in the private sector representing
mortgagees and mortgagors and HUD field counsel. Numerous changes have been made to reflect input by all the aforementioned
parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guide format was probably developed shortly after enactment of the first multifamily provisions of the National
Housing Act no later than the 1940s. The format had not been amended since 1966. Numerous disputes were arising in connection
with the guide format (then designated FHA Form No. 1725) because private counsel were uncomfortable with what they
regarded as an antiquated format which did not comport with modern opinions practice. Closings were delayed at great
cost to HUD and the private sector. Efforts to revise the format were begun in the mid-1970s however no consensus was
reached after two efforts to solicit comments from HUD field counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The attached Guide represents the HUD central office decisions made after the input described above. Names and telephone
numbers of those consulted can be provided. All consultation took place from December 1993 to date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no major problems which could not be resolved by central office decision-makers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public and governmental comments received by HUD can be provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section 202 and 811 programs currently have an OMB-approved Owner's Attorney's Closing Opinion, form HUD&hyph;90166&hyph;CA.
However, the Department has decided that it would be beneficial to participants and their counsel to have similar
formats for all loan and capital advance programs. The section 202 and 811 guide format is essentially the same as the
insured loan format except for some differences in terminology and program requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. No assurance of confidentiality was given.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. No sensitive questions are addressed in the Guide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The estimated annualized cost to the federal government of collecting and storing the opinion based upon an hourly
rate of $20.00 per hour and a total of seven hours is $240.00. The opinion is one of many documents which is collected
at each loan closing and is stored in the docket file which is maintained for the life of the project loan in the federal
records center. For capital advances, the closing opinion would be kept in Field Office Docket. There is also the cost
of review of the document by HUD field counsel. We estimate that this review should take approximately one-half hour
and based upon an hourly rate of $24.00, the total cost would be $8400.00. Neither of these figures should change substantially
from the previous total cost to the federal government under FHA Form No. 1725.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total annualized cost to mortgagors or owners of retaining private counsel to prepare the opinion is estimated
to be $122,500.00, which is based upon a total of 700 hours at an average cost per hour of $175.00. (Although one hour
is expended completing the form, 100 to 150 hours are expended by mortgagor's or owner's counsel in representing the
mortgagor or owner and a mortgage line item covers such typical total cost of approximately $20,000.00.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The above estimates are based upon an estimated total of 700 multifamily rental project and health care facility
loan closings per year, which is based upon last year's totals of approximately 500 FHA insured mortgage loan closings
and 200 section 202 elderly closings. It is anticipated that the section 202 elderly closings will decrease and the
FHA insured loan closings will increase by an off-setting amount. One legal opinion is required per closing. These
estimates are based upon HUD's program staff experience in dealing with the aforementioned mortgage line item, the
referenced loan closings and the experience of HUD personnel who have recently acted as counsel to mortgagors in the
private sector.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Although the guide is longer than the form it replaces, there is no substantial difference in the amount of time
which will be expended by the parties involved in the preparation, review and collection of the opinion. The use of
word processing technology and its redlining capability will make it possible to handle the increased length without
any significant increase in time expended. Further, the new guide, by providing more specific instructions, should
resolve many conflicts which had created intolerable delays in many closings. Such delays often resulted in the involvement
of central office legal staff thereby further increasing the workload upon all the involved parties to the mortgage
loan or capital advance transaction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In basing the opinions set forth in this opinion on ``our [my] knowledge,'' the words ``our [my] knowledge'' signify
that, in the course of our [my] representation of the Owner, no facts have come to our [my] attention that would give
us [me] actual knowledge or actual notice that any such opinions or other matters are not accurate. Except as otherwise
stated in this opinion, we [I] have undertaken no investigation or verification of such matters. Further, the words
``our [my] knowledge'' as used in this opinion are intended to be limited to the actual knowledge of the attorneys within
our [my] firm who have been involved in representing the Owner in any capacity including, but not limited to, in connection
with the Capital Advance. We [I] have no reason to believe that any of the documents on which we [I] have relied contain
matters which, or the assumptions contained herein, are untrue, contrary to known facts, or unreasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reaching the opinions set forth below, we [I] have assumed, and to our [my] knowledge there are no facts inconsistent
with, the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Each of the parties to the Documents, other than the Owner (and any person executing any of the Documents on behalf
of the Owner), has duly and validly executed and delivered each such instrument, document, and agreement to be executed
in connection with the Capital Advance to which such party is a signatory, and such party's obligations set forth in
the Documents are its legal, valid, and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with this respective terms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Each person executing any of the Documents, other than the Owner (and any person executing any of the Documents
on behalf of the Owner), whether individually or on behalf of an entity, is duly authorized to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Each natural person executing any of the Documents is legally competent to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All signatures of parties other than the Owner (and any person executing any of the Documents on behalf of Owner)
are genuine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) All Documents which were submitted to us [me] as originals are authentic; all Documents which were submitted to
us [me] as certified or photostatic copies conform to the original document, and all public records reviewed are accurate
and complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) All applicable Documents have been duly filed, indexed, and recorded among the appropriate official records,
and all fees, charges, and taxes due and owing as of this date have been paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The parties to the Documents and their successors and assigns will: (i) Act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable
manner in the exercise of any rights or enforcement of any remedies under the Documents; (ii) not engage in any conduct
in the exercise of such rights or enforcement of such remedies that would constitute other than fair and impartial
dealing; and (iii) comply with all requirements of applicable procedural and substantive law in exercising any rights
or enforcing any remedies under the Documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The exercise of any rights or enforcement of any remedies under the Documents would not be unconscionable, result
in a breach of the peace, or otherwise be contrary to public policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Owner has title or other interest in each item of (i) real and (ii) tangible personal property (``Personalty'')
comprising the Property in which a security interest is purported to be granted under the Documents [and, where Personalty
is to be acquired after the date hereof, a security interest is created under the after-acquired property clause of
the Security Agreement]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In rendering this opinion we [I] also have assumed that the Documents accurately reflect the complete understanding
of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated thereby and the rights and the obligations of the parties
thereunder. We [I] also have assumed that the terms and the conditions of the Capital Advance as stated in the Documents
have not been amended, modified or supplemented, directly or indirectly, by any other agreement or understanding
of the parties or waiver of any of the material provisions of the Documents. After reasonable inquiry of the Owner,
we [I] have no knowledge of any facts or information that would lead us [me] to believe that the assumptions in this paragraph
not justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In rendering this, we [I] also have assumed that: (i) all Personalty in which a security interest is created under the
Documents (other than accounts or goods of a type normally used in more than one jurisdiction) is located at the Property
and (ii) Owner's [Chief Executive Office] [only place of business] [residence] is located in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

to believe that the assumptions in this paragraph are not justified.

In rendering this opinion we [I] have, with your approval, relied as to certain matters of fact set forth in the Owner's
Opinion Certificate, the Certificate of Good Standing [and certain other specified Documents,] as set forth herein.
After reasonable inquiry of the Owner as to the accuracy and completeness of the Owner's Opinion Certificate, the
Certificate of Good Standing, [and such other Documents], and we [I] have no knowledge of any facts or information
that would lead us [me] to believe that such reliance is not justified.

Instructions to Guide for Opinion of Owner's Counsel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Explanatory Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The guide for this opinion has been prepared in view of the ABA Accord and various state law bar reports on opinion letters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department regards the counsel to the Owner as the crucial, central figure in the process of preparing and executing
the legal and administrative documents necessary to achieve a closing in connection with a first Mortgage (Deed of
Trust) and Mortgage Note (``Capital Advance'') from HUD to the Owner. Pursuant to 24 CFR part 24, 24.105(p), attorneys
or others in a business relationship with the Owner are defined as ``principals.'' Even though the Guide is quite different
than its predecessor (HUD 90166&hyph;CA), such revision does not in any fashion relieve the counsel to the Owner of
its obligations to its client and the Department. In part, these responsibilities entail the exercise of due diligence
to assure the accurate and timely preparation, completion and submission of the forms required by the Department
in connection with the transaction. Further, the counsel to the Owner and any other attorneys involved in the transaction,
should be thoroughly familiar with the regulations, procedures and directives of the Department pertaining to each
transaction in which counsel participates. The Department takes seriously the preparation and completion of the
various documents involved in the Capital Advance Program (most of which are HUD Form documents) and cannot overemphasize
the importance of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Warning: HUD will prosecute false claims and statements. Conviction may result in criminal and/or civil penalties.
(18 U.S.C. 1001, 1010, 1012; 31 U.S.C. 3729, 3802)'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With limited state law related exceptions, we expect that Owner's counsel will be able to follow the guide opinion
and HUD field counsel should not accept opinions that otherwise substantially or materially deviate from the guide.
Although we understand that attorneys and law firms may have evolved particular styles and forms of opinion, HUD field
counsel do not have time to negotiate each and every opinion and it is essential that the guide be followed in both style
and substance in order to ensure a timely closing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The counsel to the Owner is expected to complete a draft opinion for submission to HUD field counsel ten days prior to
the closing along with the other closing documents. Any deviations should be specifically identified (blacklined
or highlighted) and discussed with field counsel at that time. Any material deviation not required by State or local
law must be brought to the attention of HUD's Office of General Counsel by field counsel along with an explanation as
to the necessity for the deviation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brackets are used in the opinion letter to indicate alternate language, insertions, documents, or instructions
depending on the applicable facts and underlining is used to indicate blanks that must be completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guide opinion contains some instructions and definitions and is largely self-explanatory; however, the following
instructions and clarifications may be helpful. The numbers and letters used below relate to the paragraph numbers
and letters in the guide opinion unless page numbers are specifically designated.

&bull;Letterhead and date: The opinion must be typed on the firm or single practitioner's letterhead and dated the
date of the Capital Advance by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reference: Data regarding the project (name, HUD project number, and location must be accurate and inserted

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;In General: Each document executed in connection with the Capital Advance must be listed by its correct title.
It is imperative that care must be taken to compile a list that accurately and completely reflects the transaction
prior to submission to HUD of the initial draft. After HUD review of the initial draft, the opinion may have to be modified,
as necessary, to satisfy HUD.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All documents executed in connection with the Capital Advance must be listed regardless of whether the document is
required by HUD. The appropriate HUD or FHA form number, if applicable, must be indicated in parens after each document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the Documents must be reviewed. The following HUD guidelines should be followed in preparing or reviewing the
Documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. HUD Handbook 4571.5, Supportive Housing for the Elderly_Conditional Commitment_Final Closing, dated July 1992,
should be followed. This Handbook provides copies of most of the Documents required by HUD to be used in the 202 Program
Closings. Until HUD publishes a similar Handbook for the Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program,
section 811 Capital Advance closings shall follow the 4571.5 Handbook.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. All 202 and 811 Owners must adopt the model Certificate of Incorporation (HUD-91732-A-CA) except for Field Counsel
modifications related to State law or modifications required by the Internal Revenue Service. All other modifications
must be approved by HUD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The HUD field counsel have not been consistent in requiring HUD to be named in the Financing Statements as a secured
party or as its interests may appear; consequently, the requirement that HUD be so named is now being standardized.
This should be clarified through appropriate language in the Security Agreement. The purpose is to clarify that,
under certain circumstances, HUD may assert some rights in the personalty arising under the Regulatory Agreement
which would precede an assignment of the mortgage. This is desirable in the event HUD exercises some of its remedies
under the Regulatory Agreement in cases where the mortgage has not been assigned to HUD. It will not be necessary for
HUD to consent to every UCC termination, renewal, assignment, etc. until HUD's rights as a secured party are established.
HUD is being named ``as its interests appear'' so that, for example, where HUD obtains a court order, HUD will be able
to establish a paramount interest in the Project income stream, and other personality pursuant to the Regulatory
Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. UCC searches: The UCC Search can be conducted by either the title insurance company, a reputable document search
firm, the counsel to the Owner or any other attorney licensed in the jurisdiction. One or more UCC searches performed
not more than 30 days prior to the date of the opinion of Owner's counsel must be made and retained by the field counsel
in the Capital Advance file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Evidence of zoning compliance: The evidence of zoning compliance will vary depending on the circumstances. The
evidence should establish that the building, if constructed according to plans and circumstances, will comply with
all zoning requirements. The evidence may be in the form of a letter or certificate from the appropriate local official
stating that, if the building is constructed according to the plans and specifications submitted for review, the
building will comply with all zoning requirements. If the locality has no zoning ordinance, a letter should be submitted
from the chief executive stating such. In those circumstances, it may be necessary to obtain a letter from the local
planning body of the county in which the project is located, that the proposed development is compatible with the county's
comprehensive plan. If the zoning approval is based upon a variance or other special action, the closing may have to
be delayed until the time for appeals has run. In extremely complex cases, an opinion may need to be obtained from legal
counsel specializing in local zoning matters. Such letter must be attached as an exhibit and referenced in the appropriate
paragraphs of the Opinion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Survey: the survey must be signed, sealed and dated within 90 days of the closing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Docket search: The Docket Search can be conducted by either the title insurance company, a reputable document search
firm, the counsel to the Owner or any other attorney licensed in the jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. If any UCC Financing Statements have been filed on the Personalty in conjunction with any transaction other than
the Capital Advance, they must be identified to the HUD field counsel as well as details with respect to how such Financing
Statements will be terminated at the time of closings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If the Owner or any principal of the Owner is involved in any litigation, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
such litigation matter(s) must be disclosed in writing to HUD field counsel. If the litigation involves HUD's compliance
with civil rights requirements, it must immediately be brought to the attention of appropriate Fair Housing and Equal
Opportunity personnel. As an example, it is not uncommon for neighbors of a proposed site for a group home for persons
with disabilities to harbor discriminatory attitudes toward persons with disabilities and to sue to attempt to block
the establishment or operation of a group home.

Acceptability of Counsel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Owner's counsel must opine as to the law of the Property jurisdiction and the state of Owner's organization,
if different from the Property jurisdiction. HUD requires that Owner's counsel be admitted to practice law in each
jurisdiction in which such admission is required by the laws or ethical considerations of the bar to be able to give
the opinion. If multiple jurisdictions are involved, two opinions may be required: one with respect to the organization
of the Owner and another with respect to the real property and Capital Advance issues. A combination of the Owner's
regular counsel and special local counsel may be required to satisfy this requirement. If counsel's satisfaction
of these requirements is not evident from the letterhead of the firm, the field counsel should include a written explanation
in the Capital Advance Closing File. In all events, each provision in the Guide must be addressed whether one or more
opinions is required to do so.

&bull;A form of Owner's Certification is attached. The form represents the minimum amount of information that should
be obtained from the Owner (but additions, revisions and rephrasing are acceptable so long as the Owner is certifying
as to factual matters and not legal conclusions). The Owner's Certification must be dated the same date as the Capital
Advance Documents.

Instructions to Guide for Opinion of Mortgagor's Counsel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Explanatory Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The guide for this opinion has been prepared in view of changes in opinion practice as reflected by the ABA Accord and
various state law bar reports on opinion letters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department regards the counsel to the Mortgagor as the crucial, central figure in the process of preparing and
executing the legal and administrative documents necessary to achieve a closing where the mortgage note is endorsed
for mortgage insurance by the Department. Pursuant to 24 CFR part 24, 24.105(p), attorneys or others in a business
relationship with the Mortgagor are defined as ``principals.'' Even though the Guide is quite different in form from
its predecessor (FHA Form No. 1725), the substance is not intended to be substantially different and the revision
does not in any fashion relieve the counsel to the Mortgagor of its obligations to its client, the Mortgagee and the
Department. In part, these responsibilities entail the exercise of due diligence to assure the accurate and timely
preparation, completion and submission of the forms required by the Department in connection with the transaction.
Further, the counsel to the Mortgagor and any other attorneys involved in the transaction, should be thoroughly familiar
with the regulations, procedures and directives of the Department pertaining to each mortgage insurance transaction
in which counsel participates. The Department takes seriously the preparation and completion of the various documents
involved in the mortgage insurance process (most of which are HUD form documents) and cannot overemphasize the importance
of the following:

Warning: HUD will prosecute false claims and statements. Conviction may result in criminal and/or civil penalties.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With limited state law related exceptions, we expect that Mortgagor's counsel will be able to follow the guide in rendering
an opinion and HUD field counsel should not accept opinions that otherwise substantially or materially deviate from
the guide. Although we understand that attorneys and law firms may have evolved particular styles and forms of opinion,
HUD field counsel do not have time to negotiate each and every opinion for stylistic changes and it is essential that
the guide be followed in both style and substance in order to ensure a timely closing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The counsel to the Mortgagor is expected to complete a draft opinion for submission to HUD field counsel at least ten
days prior to the closing along with the other closing documents. Any deviations should be specifically identified
(blacklined or highlighted) and discussed with field counsel at that time. Any material deviation not required by
State or local law must be brought to the attention of the Assistant General Counsel, Multifamily Mortgage Division,
by field counsel along with an explanation as to the necessity for the deviation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the guide can be utilized in connection with all types of closings: Insured advances or insurance
upon completion (for new construction or substantial rehabilitation); final closings (for refinancings, etc.).
Therefore, it is crucial that the correct options be selected in instances where choices are provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brackets are used in the opinion letter to indicate alternate language, insertions, documents, or instructions
depending on the applicable facts and underlining is used to indicate blanks that must be completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guide opinion contains some instructions and definitions and is largely self-explanatory; however, the following
instructions and clarifications may be helpful. The numbers and letters used below relate to the paragraph numbers
and letters in the guide opinion unless page numbers are specifically designated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Addressees: The opinion must be delivered to HUD as well as the Mortgagee making the loan to establish the explicit
right of each to rely on the opinion. The Mortgagee's counsel may be relying on the opinion for certain aspects of its
opinion. If so, the opinion must also be addressed to counsel to the Mortgagee.

&bull;Description of the Loan: The loan amount is the original principal amount of the loan being insured unless a
modification is necessitated in connection with the closing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 &bull;Source of funds for the Loan: In the second full sentence on page 2 the source of funds must be accurately identified.

List of Documents

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;In General: If there are no brackets around a particular document, the document is one which is commonly used
for initial endorsements for insured advances completion cases; however, it should be emphasized that it is impossible
to list every document for every insured loan. Further, no attempt has been made to list all documents utilized in all
types of refinancings and certain specialized programs, e.g. certificates of need and licenses for health care programs.
Conversely, some documents may not be utilized in a particular transaction and should be deleted from the list in the
actual opinion. Brackets around the name of the document indicate that the document may or may not be used for every
loan. If bracketed documents are not used in a particular loan transaction, then delete such documents from the list
in the actual opinion. Each document executed in connection with the loan must be listed by its correct title, showing
each party executing it and its date. If documents are dated ``as of'' a particular date, then such phrase should be
included in the description in the text. It is imperative that care must be taken to compile a list that accurately and
completely reflects the transaction in the submission to HUD of the initial draft. After HUD review of the initial
draft, the opinion may have to be modified, as necessary, to satisfy HUD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All documents executed in connection with the loan transaction must be listed regardless of whether the document
is required by HUD. The appropriate HUD or FHA form number, if applicable, must be indicated in parenthesis after each
document. Please note that the Guide lists a four digit number after virtually all of the standard HUD documents. In
many instances as these forms have been updated, the four digit number has been changed so that they are now preceded
by a ``9.'' However, HUD is in the process of changing to a standardized four digit number which should become effective
in 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Organizational Documents: All of the Organizational Documents must be reviewed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. In addition to reviewing the Organizational Documents listed in the opinion, the following HUD guidelines should
be followed in preparing or reviewing the following organizational documents.

a. Corporate mortgagor_any form of corporate charter or articles of incorporation may be used which:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Contains nothing inconsistent with the Regulatory Agreement,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Gives the Mortgagor the powers necessary to operate the project and execute the note and mortgage, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Specifically authorizes the execution of the Regulatory Agreement.

b. Partnership Mortgagor_A copy of the partnership agreement should be furnished and should be examined to determine
that it contains nothing inconsistent with the Regulatory Agreement and that the term of the partnership equals or
exceeds the term of the Mortgage Loan. It should further contain a provision substantially as follows:

The partnership is authorized to execute a note and mortgage in order to secure a loan to be insured by the Secretary
of Housing and Urban Development and to execute a Regulatory Agreement and other documents required by the Secretary
in connection with such loan. Any incoming general partner shall as a condition of receiving an interest in the partnership
agree to be bound by the note, mortgage, and Regulatory Agreement and other documents required in connection with
the FHA insured loan to the same extent and on the same terms as the other general partners. Upon any dissolution, no
title or right to possession and control of the project, and no right to collect the rents therefrom shall pass to any
person who is not bound by the Regulatory Agreement in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Trust_any Trust Agreement before it is finally accepted generally should:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Give the trustee the powers necessary to execute the note and mortgage; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Specifically authorize the execution of the Regulatory Agreement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Contain nothing inconsistent with the Regulatory Agreement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Prohibit the transfer of beneficial interest prior to completion of the project without the prior written consent
of the Secretary and prohibit the transfer of such interest subsequent to completion of the project unless the new
beneficiary assumes and agrees to be bound by the Regulatory Agreement; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Require that the Secretary be advised ten (10) days prior to any proposed transfers of beneficial interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. The HUD field counsel have not been consistent in requiring HUD to be named in the Financing Statements as a secured
party or as its interests may appear; consequently, the requirement that HUD be so named is now being standardized.
This should be clarified through appropriate language in the Security Agreement. The purpose is to clarify that,
under certain circumstances, HUD may assert some rights in the personalty arising under the Regulatory Agreement
which would precede an assignment of the mortgage. This is desirable in the event HUD exercises some of its remedies
under the Regulatory Agreement in cases where the mortgage has not been assigned to HUD. It will not be necessary for
HUD to consent to every UCC termination, renewal, assignment, etc. until HUD's rights as a secured party are established.
HUD is being named ``as its interests appear'' so that, for example, where HUD obtains a court order, HUD will be able
to establish a paramount interest in the Project income stream, and other personalty pursuant to the Regulatory Agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. UCC searches: The UCC search can be conducted by either the title insurance company, a reputable document search
firm, the counsel to the Mortgagor or any other attorney licensed in the jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
T. Evidence of zoning compliance: The evidence of zoning compliance will vary depending on the circumstances. The
evidence should establish that the building, if constructed according to plans and circumstances, will comply with
all zoning requirements. The evidence may be in the form of a letter or certificate from the appropriate local official
stating that, if the building is constructed according to the plans and specifications submitted for review, the
building will comply with all zoning requirements. In refinancing cases where no construction is involved, the evidence
may be in the form of a letter certifying that the existing building(s) is (are) in compliance with outstanding zoning
requirements or, if not, the nonconforming variance, etc., is acceptable. If the locality has no zoning ordinance,
a letter should be submitted from the chief executive stating such. In those circumstances, it may be necessary to
obtain a letter from the local planning body of the county in which the project is located, that the proposed development
is compatible with the county's comprehensive plan. If the zoning approval is based upon a variance or other special
action, the closing may have to be delayed until the time for appeals has run. In extremely complex cases, an opinion
may need to be obtained from legal counsel specializing in local zoning matters. Such letter must be attached as an
exhibit and referenced in the appropriate paragraphs of the Opinion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
W. Survey: The survey must be signed, sealed and dated within 90 days of the closing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LL. Bond documents: This does not include all documents involved in the typical bond financing. It does include those
principal documents such as the Prospectus, the Indenture, a sample Bond, etc. Moreover, all documents executed
by the Mortgagor or which establish or describe any obligations of the Mortgagor must be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OO. Docket search: The Docket search can be conducted by either the title insurance company, a reputable document
search firm, the counsel to the Mortgagor or any other attorney licensed in the jurisdiction.

Opinions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This paragraph contains several options depending upon whether the Mortgagor's organizational documents were
prepared by counsel rendering the opinion and the type of mortgagor entity. Care should be taken to ensure that the
correct option is selected and that the requisite information is inserted correctly. It is intended that, where the
mortgagor entity or general partner of the mortgagor entity is established by counsel to the Mortgagor, no reliance
on other sources is permitted and counsel must opine as to the due organization of the Mortgagor. If a Certificate of
Good Standing is not available in the State, but an equivalent document is (i.e., Certificate of Existence), then
the bracketed language must be revised to reflect the name/title of the equivalent document so obtained. Any Certificate
of Good Standing or equivalent document issued by the applicable governmental authority must be dated no more than
30 days prior to the date of the opinion of Mortgagor's counsel. If a Certificate of Good Standing or equivalent document
cannot be obtained from the applicable governmental authority (e.g., for general partnerships, then the Mortgagor's
attorney will be required to do the due diligence necessary to give the opinion or may engage other counsel to render
such opinion). If the Property jurisdiction is not the State of formation for the mortgagor entity, counsel must also
opine that the Mortgagor is qualified to transact business in the Property jurisdiction. Such opinion may be made
solely on the basis of a certificate from the applicable governmental authorities of the Property jurisdiction,
and if counsel is relying on such certificate(s), then the opinion must expressly identify those certificate(s)
and they must be attached to the opinion as an exhibit. If the Mortgagor is an individual, paragraph one should be deleted
from the opinion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. If any UCC Financing Statements have been filed on the Personalty in conjunction with any transaction other than
the Loan, they must be identified to the HUD field counsel as well as details with respect to how such Financing Statements
will be terminated at the time of closings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. If the Mortgagor or any principal of the Mortgagor is involved in any litigation, all such litigation matter(s)
must be disclosed in writing to HUD field counsel in order that the Department can determine whether the endorsement
of the loan is possible. If the litigation involves HUD's compliance with civil rights requirements, it must immediately
be brought to the attention of appropriate Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity personnel. As an example, it is not uncommon
for neighbors of a proposed site for a group home for persons with disabilities to harbor discriminatory attitudes
toward persons with disabilities and to sue to attempt to block the establishment or operation of a group home.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. If the property is an elderly housing project or a health care facility or if the loan otherwise is to be secured by
significant amounts of personal property, the matter should be discussed with field counsel. In the event further
discussion is necessary, field counsel should contact the Assistant General Counsel, Multifamily Mortgage Division.
For projects in which the personalty is mostly household appliances (e.g., refrigerators) or a limited quantity
of smaller equipment, the opinion will be limited as shown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One or more UCC searches performed not more than 30 days prior to the date of the opinion of Mortgagor's counsel must
be made and retained by the field counsel in the loan file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. If the Mortgagor is a trust (other than a land trust), then Paragraph 15 must be included in the opinion letter. The
second sentence need only be included if the trust was formed in a jurisdiction other than the Property jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Mortgagor's counsel must opine as to the law of the Property jurisdiction and the state of Mortgagor's organization,
if different from the Property jurisdiction. HUD requires that Mortgagor's counsel be admitted to practice law in
each jurisdiction in which such admission is required by the laws or ethical considerations of the bar to be able to
give the opinion. If multiple jurisdictions are involved, two opinions may be required: one with respect to the organization
of the Mortgagor and another with respect to the real property and loan issues. A combination of the Mortgagor's regular
counsel and special local counsel may be required to satisfy this requirement. If counsel's satisfaction of these
requirements is not evident from the letterhead of the firm, the field counsel should include a written explanation
in the Washington docket. In all events, each provision in the Guide must be addressed whether one or more opinions
is required to do so.

should be obtained from the Mortgagor (but additions, revisions and rephrasings are acceptable so long as the Mortgagor
is certifying as to factual matters and not legal conclusions). The Mortgagor's Certification must be dated the same
date as the Loan Documents.

In basing the opinions set forth in this opinion on ``our [my] knowledge,'' the words ``our [my] knowledge'' signify
that, in the course of our [my] representation of the Mortgagor, no facts have come to our [my] attention that would
give us [me] actual knowledge or actual notice that any such opinions or other matters are not accurate. Except as otherwise
stated in this opinion, we [I] have undertaken no investigation or verification of such matters. Further, the words
``our [my] knowledge'' as used in this opinion are intended to be limited to the actual knowledge of the attorneys within
our [my] firm who have been involved in representing the Mortgagor in any capacity including, but not limited to, in
connection with this Loan. We [I] have no reason to believe that any of the documents on which we [I] have relied contain
matters which, or the assumptions contained herein, are untrue, contrary to known facts, or unreasonable.

In reaching the opinions set forth below, we [I] have assumed, and to our [my] knowledge there are no facts inconsistent
with, the following:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Each of the parties to the Documents, other than the Mortgagor (and any person executing any of the Documents on
behalf of the Mortgagor), has duly and validly executed and delivered each such instrument, document, and agreement
to be executed in connection with the Loan to which such party is a signatory, and such party's obligations set forth
in the Documents are its legal, valid, and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Each person executing any of the Document, other than the Mortgagor (and any person executing any of the Documents
on behalf of the mortgagor), whether individually or on behalf of an entity, is duly authorized to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Each natural person executing any of the Documents is legally competent to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All signatures of parties other than the Mortgagor (and any person executing any of the Documents on behalf of Mortgagor)
are genuine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) All Documents, which were submitted to us [me] as originals are authentic; all Documents which were submitted
to us [me] as certified or photostatic copies conform to the original document, and all public records reviewed are
accurate and complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) All applicable Documents have been duly filed, indexed, and recorded among the appropriate official records
and all fees, charges, and taxes due and owing as of this date have been paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The parties to the Documents and their successors and/or assigns will: (i) act in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner in the exercise of any rights or enforcement of any remedies under the Documents; (ii) not engage
in any conduct in the exercise of such rights or enforcement of such remedies that would constitute other than fair
and impartial dealing; and (iii) comply with all requirements of applicable procedural and substantive law in exercising
any rights or enforcing any remedies under the Documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The exercise of any rights or enforcement of any remedies under the Documents would not be unconscionable, result
in a breach of the peace, or otherwise be contrary to public policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Mortgagor has title or other interest in each item of (i) real and (ii) tangible personal property (``Personalty'')
comprising the Property in which a security interest is purported to be granted under the Loan Documents [and, where
Personalty is to be acquired after the date hereof, a security interest is created under the after-acquired property
clause of the Security Agreement].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In rendering this opinion we [I] also have assumed that the Documents accurately reflect the complete understanding
of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated thereby and the rights and the obligations of the parties
thereunder. We [I] also have assumed that the terms and the conditions of the Loan as stated in the Documents have not
been amended, modified or supplemented, directly or indirectly, by any other agreement or understanding of the parties
or waiver of any of the material provisions of the Documents. After reasonable inquiry of the Mortgagor, we [I] have
no knowledge of any facts or information that would lead us [me] to believe that the assumptions in this paragraph are
not justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In rendering our [my] opinion in paragraph 13, we [I] also have assumed that: (i) all Personalty in which a security
interest is created under the Documents (other than accounts or goods of a type normally used in more than one jurisdiction)
is located at the Property and (ii) Mortgagor's [Chief Executive Office] [only place of business] [residence] is
located in

[me] to believe that the assumptions in this paragraph are not justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In rendering this opinion, we [I] have, with your approval, relied as to certain matters of fact set forth in the Mortgagor's
Opinion Certification, the Good Standing Certificate(s) [and certain other specified Documents,] as set forth
herein. After reasonable inquiry of the Mortgagor as to the accuracy and completeness of the Mortgagor's Opinion
Certification, the Good Standing Certificate(s), [and such other Documents], we [I] have no knowledge of any facts
or information that would lead us [me] to believe that such reliance is not justified.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
An experimental forest for state-managed lands on the Western Olympic Peninsula was recommended in 1989 by the Commission
on Old Growth Alternatives_a citizens' advisory group with broad representation. The stated purpose was twofold:
To test innovative methods of forest management designed to produce a sustained level of timber harvest while simultaneously
protecting and restoring the forest ecosystem. The Olympic Experimental State Forest includes all state-owned
lands on the western Olympic Peninsula, north of the Queets River. It is located in Clallam and Jefferson counties
and totals 264,000 acres of forest lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The listing of the northern spotted owl (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strix occidentalis caurina
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as ``threatened'' under the Act in 1990, required that activities in the area proposed for the Olympic Experimental
State Forest comply with section 9 of the Act which prohibits the ``take'' of listed species. Such prohibition limits
the range of options for experimentation and research available on the experimental forest. See also 50 CFR 17.31(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1992, Congress passed legislation (Pub. L. 102&hyph;436, title II) specifically addressing the Olympic
Experimental State Forest. The purpose of the legislation is:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``To assist the experimental management and research program being conducted by the State of Washington on State-owned
trust lands on the western Olympic Peninsula in order to contribute to the conservation of the northern spotted owl,
old growth ecosystems and fishery resources and to provide for a sustainable supply of timber and trust income in a
manner that is consistent with these conservation objectives.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The WDNR is proposing to develop a plan for the operation of an experimental forest on state managed lands on the Olympic
Peninsula. This planning effort is encouraged by federal legislation (Pub. L. 102&hyph;436 Title II) that allows
the WDNR to develop an integrated plan for species conservation, research, and commodity production across the 264,000
acres of state managed forested lands on the Olympic Peninsula. The plan is intended to enable the WDNR to implement
an experimental management and research program while continuing some timber harvest in a way that is consistent
with the Act. The plan is to provide necessary guidance in the implementation of cooperative research projects, monitoring
programs, and forest land management. The plan will be developed in consultation with the Washington State Department
of Wildlife and the University of Washington's Olympic Natural Resources Center.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WDNR will seek federal approval of its plan as called for in Public Law 102&hyph;436 Title II and as necessary to
meet the applicable requirements of the Act, as necessary. Upon submission of the plan and public review and comment,
the Secretary shall determine whether the plan provides for the conservation of the northern spotted owl in the experimental
forest and whether it is consistent with northern spotted owl recovery goals. If the WDNR's plan for the experimental
forest is approved by the Secretary, actions to implement it will not be considered a prohibited ``taking'' of the
northern spotted owl pursuant to Public Law 102&hyph;436, title II, section 204(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One issue to be examined during the scoping is the effect of the plan on other listed species, such as the marbled murrelet
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachyramphus marmoratus marmoratus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and bald eagle (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Haliacetus leucorephalus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and possible methods of addressing these effects under the Act. Another issue to be examined is the effect of the
plan on anadromous fish stocks found in this part of the Olympic Peninsula.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental review of this project will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of NEPA, 42 U.S.C.,

from Brazil of ferrosilicon,

Schedule of the United States, that have been found by the Department of Commerce to be sold in the United States at less
than fair value (LTFV). The Commission also unanimously determines, pursuant to &sect;735(b)(4)(A) of the Act,
that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to ferrosilicon imports from Brazil; thus, the retroactive
imposition of antidumping duties is not necessary.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission instituted this investigation effective August 12, 1993, following a preliminary determination
by the Department of Commerce that imports of ferrosilicon from Brazil were being sold at LTFV within the meaning of
section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of
a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary,
U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 26, 1993 (58 FR 45120). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on September 14, 1993, and all persons who requested
the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on February 18,
1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2722 (February 1994), entitled ``Ferrosilicon
from Brazil: Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;641 (Final).''

 The ICC is issuing a policy statement (set forth below) explaining and interpreting new statutory requirements governing
the form and minimum contents for transportation agreements executed by motor contract carriers. These new requirements
are in section 6 of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;180) and apply to contracts entered into after
March 3, 1994. The Commission does not plan to issue a further decision unless the comments expose issues that require
additional clarification.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 6 of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 (NRA), added new statutory requirements governing the form, minimum
contents, and retention period for transportation agreements executed by motor contract carriers, as well as regulatory
auditing and enforcement by the Commission of contract carriage requirements. By this policy statement, we discuss
these new requirements and explain how we interpret certain of the new provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new requirements are similar to our prior regulations at 49 CFR 1053.1 (1991 ed.). They required contract carriers
to enter into bilateral written contracts that (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
): (a) Named the particular shipper or shippers involved, and (b) covered a series of shipments during a stated period
of time in contrast to separate contracts of carriage governing individual shipments. A number of defunct carriers
have sought to disavow their own contract carriage agreements by alleging technical noncompliance with those regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In an effort to prevent such a misuse of its regulations, the Commission repealed those regulations, in Contracts
for Transportation of Property, 8 I.C.C.2d 520 (1992) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 (D.C. Cir. argued June 12, 1992; petitioners' motions to dismiss as moot pending). In section 6 of the NRA, Congress
adopted the essential requirements of the repealed regulations. Congress' stated objective was ``to limit the potential
for unwarranted future undercharge claims.'' H. Rep. 103&hyph;359, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 10 (1993).

Requirements of Section 6 of the NRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(a) of the NRA contains the new regulatory requirements to be codified at 49 U.S.C. 10702(c).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 New section 10702(c)(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act requires that, for motor transportation contracts entered
into after March 3, 1994 (i.e., 90 days after enactment of the NRA), there must be ``a written agreement, separate from
the bill of lading or receipt.'' This requirement is identical to the writing requirement in former 49 CFR 1053.1.
It is important to remember that the signed agreement must be in place before the transportation begins.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 In sections 6(b) and 6(c) of the NRA, Congress amended 49 U.S.C. 11901(g) and 11909(b), respectively, to provide for
civil and criminal penalties for violations of these new requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New section 10702(c)(2) specifies the minimum contents of the agreements. Section 10702(c)(2)(A) requires that
the agreement ``identify the parties thereto.'' This requirement follows our requirement in former 49 CFR 1053.1
that the contract provide for transportation for a particular shipper or shippers. Signatories to the agreement
must be persons authorized to bind the parties to the mutual undertakings described in the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10702(c)(2)(B) requires that the agreement ``commit the shipper to tender and the carrier to transport a
series of shipments.'' This reflects the longstanding definition at 49 U.S.C. 10102(15)(B), which limits contract
carriage of freight to ``transportation of property for compensation under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
continuing agreements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with one or more persons'' (emphasis added). A long line of Commission decisions addresses the meaning of ``a series
of shipments'' in the context of a continuing agreement. See, e.g., Interstate Van Lines, Inc._Extension_Household
Goods, 5 I.C.C.2d 168, 185&hyph;86 (1988) (Interstate Van Lines). On the one hand, isolated shipments or so-called
spot market transportation are not sufficient to satisfy the series of shipments standard. See, e.g.,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
804 F.2d 1293, 1300 (D.C. Cir. 1986). On the other hand, the standard can be met by a short-term agreement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or a so-called requirements contract that contemplates shipper tender and carrier transportation obligations
for specified traffic regardless of its frequency or amount. In the first rulemaking to address the subject, the Commission
made clear that ``the contracts need not cover long periods of time or fixed amounts of traffic.'' Contracts of Contract
Carriers, 1 M.C.C. 628 (1937). In determining whether an agreement meets the series of shipments standard, we will
continue to be guided by the essential commitment between the parties that transportation be offered and accepted
on a continuing basis.

As far back as 1937, the Commission found ``an agreement to transport property extending for a week, with a further
provision that it will continue from week to week until terminated, is an agreement for continuous transportation.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 10702(c)(2)(C) requires that the written agreement ``contain the contract rate or rates for the transportation
service to be provided or being provided.'' Neither Congress nor the Commission has previously required that the
particular rate be specified. In interpreting this new requirement, we must accommodate both the purpose of the NRA,
in reforming contract carrier requirements, and the policy of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 (1980 Act) of ``remov[ing]
many of the obstacles that (previously) kept motor contract carriers from realizing their full potential.'' H. Rep.
96&hyph;1069, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1980), reprinted in 1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2283 (``House Report'').
Our goal is to protect the integrity of contract carriage without harming contracting parties or competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, we interpret this new requirement to mean that either a fixed rate or a methodology for determining the
rate must be in or appended to the contract. This comports with the rate requirements for common carrier tariffs, as
articulated in

United States, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
793 F.2d 376, 379 (1986) (RCCC), which require that a common carrier tariff show on the face of the tariff either the
per-unit rate or how the per-unit rate is determined. For example, contracts for annual volume or incentive rates
are permissible as long as an objective methodology for computing the rate is provided in the agreement itself. References
may be made in the agreement to tariffs or other readily available publications or materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
RCCC 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
standard is appropriate for contract rates. Under this standard, the parties to the agreement can maintain pricing
flexibility while achieving the Congressional goal of guarding against a future challenge to the existence or level
of the contract rate. The price will be determinable without unduly interfering with the pricing of contract carriage
services.

Finally, section 10702(c)(2)(D) requires that the agreement ``(i) state that it provides for the assignment of motor
vehicles for a continuing period of time for the exclusive use of the shipper; or (ii) state that the service is designed
to meet the distinct needs of the shipper.'' This reflects the longstanding alternative statutory criteria for contract
carriage at 49 U.S.C. 10102(15)(B) (i) and (ii). As we read this language, the agreement need not detail how it meets
these statutory criteria, but rather simply must specify which of the two alternative statutory tests is met. We do
not believe that Congress meant to make contract drafting an unduly burdensome task or to require a contract to contain
legal argument. The requirement, however, does serve to remind parties of the statutory criteria that must be met
to qualify as contract carriage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those criteria (dedication of equipment or distinct needs) are flexible, and how they are satisfied can be tailored
to the particulars of each contracting situation. As interpreted by the Commission, ``*&blank;*&blank;* assignment
of equipment to the exclusive use of the shipper does not necessarily require that specific vehicles be used for one
shipper to the exclusion of all others *&blank;*&blank;* [but] the contracting shippers must have primary access
to the equipment, may view it as their own, and need not compete for its use among themselves or with others'',

The distinct needs alternative has been the subject of numerous Commission and court decisions. Distinct needs can
be price and/or service features tailored to the customer's requirements. For example, the distinct needs of a shipper
may be met if: ``the new service is better tailored to fit the special requirements of a shipper's business, the length
of its purse, or the select nature of the delivery service that is desired.''

Section 10702(c)(3) introduces a new requirement that written agreements for contract carriage must be retained
by the carrier for the life of the agreement and for 3 years thereafter, and that a copy be made available to the Commission
upon request. The latter requirement relates to the new statutory directive in section 10702(c)(4) that we ``conduct
periodic random audits to ensure that motor contract carriers are complying with [the requirements of section 10702(c)]
and are adhering to the rates set forth in their agreements.'' We will be conducting these audits, on a random basis,
beginning in May 1994.

Stanley Alan Azen, M.D., Revocation of Registration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 19, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Stanley Alan Azen, M.D. (Respondent), of Los Angeles, California. The Order
to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Azen's DEA Certificate of Registration, AA8786329, under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(2)
and (a)(4), and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration under 21 U.S.C. 823(f) for reason that
his continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was
docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held
on Los Angeles, California, beginning on January 6, 1993. On October 18, 1993, in her opinion and recommended ruling,
findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision, the administrative law judge recommended that the Administrator
revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 2, 1993, the Respondent filed exceptions to Judge Bittner's opinion pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.66, and on
November 18, 1993, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Acting Administrator. The Acting Administrator
has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final
order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that the Respondent is an emergency room physician who received his medical degree
in 1978 from Loma Linda University of Medicine in Loma Linda, California. Following an internship at the University
of Southern California, and his service of two residencies in emergency medicine and internal medicine, Respondent
worked at the Medical Center of North Hollywood from 1982 until 1991, and as of the date of the administrative hearing
was employed at Pacifica Hospital in Los Angeles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that on September 20, 1990, Los Angeles Police Department officers received a
report that a woman had died at Respondent's home, apparently from a drug overdose. The administrative law judge found
that when the officers arrived at the Respondent's residence, they were advised by the Respondent that the deceased
was his girl friend, and that earlier in the evening Respondent and the deceased had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana,
and snorted cocaine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the officers present at Respondent's house on that evening testified at the administrative hearing that the
police officers found inside Respondent's home two 5- by 7-inch cards with white powder on them and four small straws
in a trash can, powder on the bedboard, and glasses containing what appeared to be alcohol residue. The officer further
testified that although the items were seized, to his knowledge, no tests were conducted on them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that as a result of reports regarding the death of Respondent's girl friend, the
Medical Board of California (Board) initiated an investigation of the Respondent. One of the Board investigators
that participated in the investigation also testified at the administrative hearing. Interviews were conducted
of various law enforcement officials, including the pathologist who examined the Respondent's deceased girl friend.
The pathologist estimated that, at the time of the girl friend's death, there was approximately 20 times a fatal quantity
of cocaine in her system, and, in addition, a large quantity of cocaine metabolites. The Board investigator also interviewed
the Los Angeles County coroner, who found a large amount of cocaine in the deceased's personal property. The coroner
further stated that Respondent told the coroner that Respondent and the deceased commonly used cocaine and alcohol
on their days off.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board investigator interviewed the sister of the deceased, who revealed to the investigator that she used cocaine
with Respondent and the deceased on numerous occasions. The deceased's sister informed the Board investigator of
her knowledge that Respondent sold cocaine and that she had purchased it from him in the past.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board investigator also interviewed two acquaintances of the Respondent, both of whom admitted purchasing cocaine
from the Respondent on various occasions. One of the individuals stated that for a two to three year period, Respondent
was his sole source of cocaine, that he purchased cocaine in half gram quantities from the Respondent, and that the
Respondent made no profit from his sales. The individual went on to state that Respondent had a very high tolerance
for cocaine, and carried a small vial of it with him, however he never saw Respondent use cocaine while working.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Government also presented the testimony of a detective of the Narcotics Division of the Los Angeles Police Department
regarding his conversations with the sister of the deceased. The sister told the detective that she purchased cocaine
from the Respondent on several occasions; that Respondent sold cocaine to employees of the hospital where he was employed;
and that her sister (the decreased) had access to the safe where Respondent kept his cocaine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that in March 1991, the deceased's sister, acting as a confidential informant,
attempted a controlled purchase of cocaine from the Respondent. Prior to going to Respondent's home on March 29, 1991,
the detective searched the sister's clothing and car, and provided her with $100.00, however, the sister was not searched
because there were no female officers on duty. The detective also conceded at the hearing that the informant's shoes
were not searched, nor was there a search of the trunk or the engine compartment of her car.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sister was observed going into Respondent's home where she remained for 20 to 30 minutes. After leaving Respondent's
home, she met the detective at a pre-arranged location and turned over two containers of white powder, which later
tested positive for cocaine. She told the detective that she paid the Respondent $60.00 for the cocaine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 5, 1991, the Respondent was searched pursuant to a search warrant. The search revealed an amber glass vial
that contained a white powder resembling cocaine. Respondent was then arrested, and allegedly stated to the arresting
officer, that, ``I'm just a recreational user. People don't go to jail for using cocaine.'' Respondent later stated,
``its not my cocaine. I just store it for someone. He gives me cocaine for allowing him to store it in my house.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A search was then conducted of Respondent's house which revealed a safe which contained, among other things, two one-gram
scales commonly used to weigh and package cocaine, a clear plastic bag containing a substance which was later confirmed
to be two ounces of cocaine, as well as cocaine residue on various other items. A quantity of cocaine was also obtained
after scraping screens, grinders, and scales found in the safe. In addition, 19 grams of marijuana were seized from
the bedroom. Respondent was arrested and charged with the transportation and possession of cocaine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 16, 1991, in the Municipal Court of Los Angeles Judicial District, a four-count felony complaint was filed
against the Respondent charging him with the sale and possession of a controlled substance. Respondent pled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to one felony count of simple possession of a controlled substance on November 15, 1991. The Superior Court of California,
County of Los Angeles convicted Respondent and sentenced him to 180 days in county jail, and three years probation.
A conviction following a plea of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Respondent testified at the administrative hearing that he first experimented with marijuana and cocaine in
the 1970's and became a regular cocaine user during the 1980's. Respondent further testified that during the years
of his cocaine use, his house served as a gathering place for himself, his live-in girlfriend, her sister, as well as
several of their friends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent testified that he never sold cocaine to anyone, and that those individuals that stated that Respondent
sold them cocaine, all had a motivation to lie, and make Respondent appear responsible for his girlfriend's death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent testified that he briefly participated in the California Medical Board's diversion program for impaired
physicians, however he stated that he was rejected from the program because of pending criminal charges against him.
Respondent also testified to his participation in a drug rehabilitation program at the Betty Ford Clinic starting
in April 1991, and that during his six months in the program he never tested positive for drugs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After his conviction and as part of his probation, Respondent was enrolled in a drug rehabilitation program and was
subjected to random urinalysis from November 1991 until December 1992. None of these random tests revealed drug use.
Respondent's probation officer testified that she would recommend discontinuing drug testing for Respondent because
he had met the criterion of six months of negative drug tests.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In December 1991, the Board investigator received a letter from a medical consultant for the Medical Board, advising
that Respondent's case should be referred to the Office of the Attorney General for administrative action against
Respondent's medical license. The consultant further stated that he considered Respondent's rehabilitative attempts
insufficient to overcome his more than 20 year addiction to drugs. On April 1, 1992, the Medical Board filed an accusation
against Respondent, and a supplement thereto was filed on May 26, 1992. The accusation alleged that Respondent was
subject to disciplinary action for using, possessing and distributing cocaine. At present, no further action has
been taken by the Board.

Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(2), the Administrator may revoke a DEA Certificate of Registration if the registrant

may revoke a registration and deny any application for such registration, if he determines that the continued registration
would be inconsistent with the public interest. Section 823(f) requires that the following factors be considered:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The administrative law judge found that the Respondent had been convicted of a felony offense relating to controlled
substances, and therefore grounds exist to revoke his DEA Certificate of Registration pursuant to 824(a)(2). In
considering whether grounds exist to revoke Respondent's registration pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), the administrative
law judge found factors one, three, four and five listed in 823(f) relevant. Factor one is applicable by virtue of the
California Medical Board's filing of an Accusation and Supplemental Accusation against the Respondent. Factor
three is applicable to Respondent's felony conviction, and factors four and five were found relevant based upon Respondent's
abuse and alleged unlawful sale of controlled substances, as well as the subsequent related criminal charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge concluded that the Government did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the
Respondent sold cocaine to his girlfriend's sister on March 29, 1991. The administrative law judge made this determination
based upon the fact that neither the deceased's sister nor her car was thoroughly searched prior to her entering Respondent's
house; that the alleged purchase was neither seen nor heard by law enforcement personnel; and that the sister of the
deceased had a reason to lie. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that the record clearly established that Respondent has abused controlled substances
for many years. The administrative law judge also found that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Respondent
has recognized and dealt with the severity of his problem, or that he has progressed in his recovery to the extent that
he should be permitted to continue to hold a DEA registration. Based upon evidence of Respondent's felony conviction
and past drug abuse, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration
be revoked and any pending applications be denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Respondent filed exceptions to the administrative law judge's recommendation. The Respondent argued in part:
That the administrative law judge's recommendations were inconsistent with the testimony given by Respondent,
particularly as it related to the duration of Respondent's use of cocaine and marijuana, and the extent of the use of
cocaine by Respondent's friends and acquaintances while at his home; that although the administrative law judge
concluded that the Government failed to establish that a controlled buy took place, the administrative law judge
nevertheless made unnecessary references to events surrounding its occurrence; that the Respondent has demonstrated
a lifelong commitment to drug rehabilitation based in part on his nearly three year successful participation in a
strict and monitored regimen of random drug testing administered through the Probation Office of Los Angeles County;
that based upon the legislative intent of the public interest amendment to the Controlled Substances Act, felony
convictions are not per se violations since Respondent's crime did not involve abuse of prescription drugs; statements
relied upon by the administrative law judge regarding Respondent's insufficient attempts at drug rehabilitation
in light of his 20 year drug addiction, were based on faulty and incomplete evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator having considered the entire record adopts the administrative law judge's findings of
fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling, in part. The Acting Administrator concurs with the Respondent's
exception to the administrative law judge's finding of fact regarding testimony attributed to the Respondent of
his friend's and acquaintances' daily partaking of food, drink, and cocaine while at Respondent's home. While the
record is not clear as to the exact time Respondent starting using cocaine, it is clear that he abused drugs for a significant
period of time. Additionally, the record does not support Respondent's allegations regarding the administrative
law judge's reliance on factors involving the alleged controlled buy. Finally, the record does not show that the Respondent
has demonstrated a life long commitment to drug rehabilitation, nor that the administrative law judge, in making
her recommendation, unduly relied upon the conclusions of the California Medical Board consultant that the Respondent's
rehabilitative attempts were insufficient to overcome his 20 year addiction to drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent further argued that his felony convictions are not per se violations since his crime did not involve improper
prescribing of controlled substances. DEA Administrators have consistently held that controlled substance-related
felony convictions need not involve the misuse of a DEA registration to justify revocation of the registration or
denial of an application for registration. See

Respondent's history of non-compliance with the laws relating to controlled substances speaks for itself. The Respondent
not only admitted to a long history of drug abuse, but he also admitted to using cocaine and marijuana with friends,
including his use of these controlled substances on an occasion when his girlfriend died as a result of cocaine use.
The totality of the facts leads to the conclusion that the continued registration of Dr. Azen would be inconsistent
with the public interest.

<DOCTITLE>Frank N. Beckles, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 29, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then-Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Frank N. Beckles, M.D., of 923 E Street, SE., Washington, DC
20003. The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Beckles' DEA Certificate of Registration, BB0922674, under
21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration under 21 U.S.C. 823(f) for
reason that his continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause was served on Dr. Beckles on November 2, 1993. More than thirty days have passed since the Order
to Show Cause was received by Dr. Beckles. The Drug Enforcement Administration has received no response from Dr. Beckles
or anyone purporting to represent him.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Acting Administrator finds that Dr. Beckles has waived his opportunity for a hearing.
Accordingly, under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57, the Acting Administrator enters his final order
in this matter without a hearing and based on the investigative file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator finds that on January 9, 1991, the District of Columbia Department of Consumer and Regulatory
Affairs, Board of Medicine (Board) issued to Dr. Beckles, a ``Notice of Intent to Revoke License'', and an amendment
thereto, was issued on April 16, 1991. The notices alleged charges of professional incompetence, willful and careless
disregard of the health, welfare, and safety of a patient, and failure to conform to the prevailing standards of acceptable
medical practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following a settlement conference on May 1, 1991, Dr. Beckles informed the Board of his intent to surrender his license
to practice medicine, and on June 18, 1991, Dr. Beckles consented to surrender his license to practice medicine in
the District of Columbia, effective June 30, 1991. As a result of Dr. Beckles' surrender of his medical license, on
July 10, 1991, the Board ordered the revocation of Dr. Beckles' license to practice medicine, and ordered Dr. Beckles
not to seek reinstatement of his license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator finds that as of July 10, 1991, Dr. Beckles' license to practice medicine in the District
of Columbia has been revoked, and as a result, he is unable to handle controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement Administration
cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances
in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been
consistently upheld. See

Based on the foregoing, it is clear that Dr. Beckles' DEA Certificate of Registration must be revoked. Accordingly,
the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C.
823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BB0922674, previously issued
to Frank N. Beckles, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked and that any pending applications for renewal of such registration
be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective March 3, 1994.

AKZO Salt, Inc., 3846 Retsof Road, P.O. Box 91, Retsof, New York 14539 has filed a petition to modify the application

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 30 CFR 57.19073 (hoisting during shift changes) to its Retsof Mine (I.D. No. 30&hyph;00662) located in Livingston
County, New York. The petitioner proposes to continue to conduct hoisting operations during shift changes in strict
compliance with the conditions of a previous variance that required the man cage to be completely enclosed, i.e.,
the gaps above and below the upper materials handling doors on both sides of the cage would be closed with metal plate
at least 3/16-inch thick; to make future repairs to or replacements of the man cage and other components of the hoisting
system in such a manner and to such specifications so as to ensure performance characteristics equivalent to or greater
than those of the man cage in use at the time the variance was originally granted. The petitioner asserts that the proposed
alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Notice of Final Decision

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The American Gas Association Laboratories (AGA) previously made application pursuant to section 6(b) of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970, (84 Stat. 1593, 29 U.S.C. 655), Secretary of Labor's Order No. 1&hyph;90 (55 FR 9033),
and 29 CFR 1910.7, for recognition pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.7, for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory
(see 54 FR 48166, 11/21/89), and was so recognized (see 55 FR 23312, 6/7/90).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that AGA's recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory has been expanded to
include the thirty-eight test standards (product categories) listed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of all pertinent documents (Docket No. NRTL&hyph;2&hyph;89), are available for inspection and duplication
at the Docket Office, Room N&hyph;2634, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,

Final Decision and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Because the test standards AGA requested in its application for expansion of its accreditation were in a category
different from those for which it was originally accredited, an on-site evaluation of the Cleveland Laboratory [Ex.
6A(1)] and a follow-up survey of the Los Angeles Branch Laboratory [Ex. 6A(2)] were conducted. The results were discussed
with the applicant who responded with appropriate corrective action and clarification to the comments and recommendations
made as a result of the survey of the Cleveland Laboratory [Ex. 6B]. The final on-site review report [Ex. 6] and the OSHA
staff recommendation were subsequently forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for a preliminary finding on the application.
A notice of AGA's application together with a positive preliminary finding was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 3, 1993 (58 FR 47000&hyph;47001). Interested parties were invited to submit comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no responses to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of the AGA application and preliminary finding (Docket No. NRTL&hyph;2&hyph;89).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the facts found as part of the American Gas Association Laboratories original recognition, including
details of necessary test equipment, procedures, and special apparatus of facilities needed, adequacy of staff,
the application(s) and documentation submitted by the applicant (see Exhibit 5), the OSHA staff finding including
the original on-site review report, as well as the evaluation of the current request (see Exhibit 6), OSHA finds that
the American Gas Association Laboratories has met the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 for expansion of its present recognition
to test and certify certain equipment or materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the authority in 29 CFR 1910.7, the American Gas Association Laboratories recognition is hereby expanded
to include the 38 additional test standards (product categories) cited below, subject to the conditions listed below.
This recognition is limited to equipment or materials which, under 29 CFR part 1910, require testing, listing, labeling,
approval, acceptance, or certification by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. This recognition is limited
to the use of the following 38 additional test standards for the testing and certification of equipment or materials
included within the scope of these standards.

The American Gas Association Laboratories must also abide by the following conditions of this expansion of its recognition,
in addition to those already required by 29 CFR 1910.7:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This recognition does not apply to any aspect of any program which: (1) Is available only to qualified manufacturers
and is based upon the NRTL's evaluation and accreditation of the manufacturer's quality assurance program; or (2)
makes use of reciprocal testing from another non-NRTL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration shall be allowed access to AGA's facilities and records for purposes
of ascertaining continuing compliance with the terms of its recognition and to investigate as OSHA deems necessary;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If AGA has reason to doubt the efficacy of any test standard it is using under this program, it shall promptly inform
the test standard developing organization of this fact and provide that organization with appropriate relevant
information upon which its concerns are based;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AGA shall not engage in or permit others to engage in any misrepresentation of the scope or conditions of its recognition.
As part of this condition, AGA agrees that it will allow no representation that it is either a recognized or an accredited
Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) without clearly indicating the specific equipment or material
to which this recognition is tied, or that its recognition is limited to certain products;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AGA shall inform OSHA as soon as possible, in writing, of any change of ownership or key personnel, including details;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AGA will continue to meet the requirements for recognition in all areas where it has been recognized; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AGA will always cooperate with OSHA to assure compliance with the letter as well as the spirit of its recognition and
29 CFR 1910.7.

CSA originally applied for recognition as an NRTL in 1989. In order to expedite the recognition procedure, CSA subsequently
amended its application to allow the Agency to follow a multi-phase approach. Thus CSA requested initial recognition
for its Rexdale (Toronto) facility only and requested that the scope of the application be limited to in-house testing

phase of the CSA recognition involves the CSA facilities listed above and this recognition would also be limited to

The applicant states that it provides for the implementation of control procedures for identifying the listed and
labeled equipment or materials, inspection of the production run of such items at factories for product evaluation
purposes to assure conformance with applicable test standards, and the conducting of field inspections to monitor
and to assure the proper use of its identifying mark or labels on products. A submitter must enter into a written contract
(service agreement) with CSA to permit the use of the CSA Mark on the product. This agreement clearly specifies the
submitter's responsibilities and the terms and conditions for maintaining certification, such as the right of access
by CSA inspection staff to listed factories, or notifying CSA when changes are made to certified products. These terms
and conditions are designed to protect the integrity of the CSA Marks. CSA establishes a comprehensive field services
program to ensure that manufactured products bearing any of the CSA Marks continue to meet the applicable requirements.
The program consists of three elements:

The inspections are unaccounted and are based on performing a minimum of four inspections per factory per year. The
frequency varies with production volumes, the types of products and the manufacturer's track record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When products fail to meet the requirements, Field Service Representatives take action to have the manufacturer
correct the defect immediately, quarantine the stock until the products can be reworked or re-evaluated by certification
staff, and remove the CSA Mark from the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Preliminary Finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Canadian Standards Association addressed all of the criteria which had to be met for recognition as an NRTL in its
initial application and in its further correspondence. For example, the applicant submitted a list of its test equipment
and instrumentation; a roster of its personnel including resumes of those in key positions and copies of position
descriptions; copies of a typical test report, a factory inspection form and an inspection summary; a summary of its
listing, labeling, and follow-up services; a statement of its independence as a testing laboratory; and a copy of
its Quality Assurance Manual including a description of its documentation, calibration system, appeals procedure,
recordkeeping and operational procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine major areas were examined in depth in carrying out the laboratory surveys: facility; test equipment; calibration
program; test and evaluation procedures; test reports; records; quality assurance program; follow-up listing
program; and personnel. The discrepancies noted by the survey teams in the on-site evaluations [Ex. 10.A.(1)] and
in the extensive evaluations [Ex. 10.A.(2)] were adequately responded to by the applicant prior to the preparation
of the survey report and are included as an integral part of the report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the preparation of the final survey reports of the Canadian Standards Association, the survey team was satisfied
that the testing facilities appeared to meet the necessary criteria required by the standard, and so noted in the On-Site
Review Report (Survey). (See Ex. 10.A.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following a review of the application file and the on-site survey reports of the CSA Montreal and Vancouver facilities,
and the evaluation of the Edmonton, Moncton, and Winnipeg facilities (based upon questionnaire responses, supportive
documentation, and video tapes of each site depicting the facility, test equipment, typical procedures, files,
and staff), the NRTL Recognition Program staff concluded that the applicant appeared to have met the requirements
for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory for the five above noted facilities and, therefore,
recommended to the Assistant Secretary that the application be preliminarily approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon a review of the completed application file and the recommendation of the staff, the Assistant Secretary
has made a preliminary finding that the Canadian Standards Association facilities for which accreditation was requested
(Montreal, Vancouver, Edmonton, Moncton, and Winnipeg) can meet the requirements for recognition as required by
29 CFR 1910.7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All interested members of the public are invited to supply detailed reasons and evidence supporting or challenging
the sufficiency of the applicant's having met the requirements for a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory,
as well as Appendix A, of 29 CFR 1910.7. Submission of pertinent written documents and exhibits shall be made no later
than May 2, 1994, and must be addressed to the NRTL Recognition Program, Office of Variance Determination, room N3653,
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,
DC 20210. Copies of the CSA application, the laboratory survey report, and all submitted comments, as received, (Docket
No. NRTL&hyph;2&hyph;92), are available for inspection and duplication at the Docket Office, room N2634, Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, at the above address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Secretary's final decision on whether the applicant satisfies the requirements for recognition as
an NRTL will be made on the basis of the entire record including the public submissions and any further proceedings
that the Assistant Secretary may consider appropriate in accordance with Appendix A of section 1910.7.

Notice of Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Notice is hereby given that Entela, Inc. (ENT) has made application pursuant to section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970, (84 Stat. 1593, 29 U.S.C. 655), Secretary of Labor's Order No. 1&hyph;90 (55 FR 9033), and 29
CFR 1910.7 for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The address of the laboratory covered by this application is: Entela, Inc., 3033 Madison, SE., Grand Rapids, Michigan
49548.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the merits of the application, the applicant contends that it meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 for
recognition to certify products in the areas of testing which it has specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entela, Inc. states that its application documents demonstrate that for each specified item of equipment or material

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In summary, Entela, Inc. claims that it maintains the experience, expertise, personnel, organization, equipment,
and facilities suitable for accreditation as an OSHA Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entela's Grand Rapids facility consists of two adjacent structures that each contain two buildings covering a total
of 40,000 square feet. Approximately 20,000 square feet of floor space is allocated to product testing. The main reception
area is housed in the main building, along with the conference room, main records storage area, the wet chemistry labs,
small scale flammability test room, tensile test area, with the metallurgical laboratories located on the upper
floor. The weathering and environmental aging chambers, administrative offices, and nuclear records storage area
are located in a leased building attached to this main building. The third building contains the appliance test area,
vibration and electronics laboratory. The fourth building contains the Quality Assurance Department, certain
records storage, California flammability test chamber, fabrication shop, and a metrology laboratory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural gas and city water and electricity are supplied to all of the buildings. Special utilities include liquid
nitrogen which is stored outside the second building, and a de-ionized water system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental conditions are controlled in specific laboratory areas. The temperature and humidity variations
in these laboratories are continuously monitored and recorded, as required by specific test requirements. There
are temperature and humidity chambers to control and monitor environmental conditions for specific product testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The laboratory has a shipping and receiving department for receipt, retention, and disposal of samples for testing.
Incoming samples are inspected and identified with numbered tags. All samples for one test have tags with the same
number. Each unique tag number, the samples, and the purchase order, are reviewed, and the shipping/receiving clerk
prepares a work order request, after which the samples are distributed to the test areas and copies of the work order
distributed to the appropriate departments. A copy of each unique tag and work order is retained by the shipping and
receiving department. Another copy of the work order is sent to the test department with the samples. The test department
completes the work order when all product evaluations are accomplished, and returns it to the shipping and receiving
department for sample disposition. The sample inventory and traceability information is kept in the shipping and
receiving log, and work order information is maintained on a computer data-base. All storage locations for incoming
samples are in the shipping and receiving areas, which are located indoors. The laboratory is automating the shipping
and receiving numbering system so that the work order numbers are identical with the sample tags.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each staff member wears an Entela photo I.D. Visitors can only enter via the front lobby and are required to sign in on
the visitor log. They are issued safety glasses and name tags by the receptionist and are escorted while on the premises.
Other entrances are kept locked with limited access. Separate test and conference areas are available for those clients
requiring confidentiality. The use of screens and partitions are also utilized in the laboratory.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Entela Inc. has recently upgraded their fire protection and security systems to include smoke detectors and proximity
sensors. These are connected to the security system which dispatches local fire and police departments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Test equipment is available to perform most measurement and testing in accordance with the identified test standards.
Unavailable unique test equipment is purchased or leased through an Entela-approved source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An inventory list identifies all pieces of equipment by the department number or location in the laboratory, gage
number, instrument name, manufacturer, model and serial number, range of operation, calibration frequency, and
the date the instrument was placed in service. Operational and calibration information is located in files in the
Quality Assurance Office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Test equipment is calibrated periodically depending upon the application, ranging from daily to once every three
years. Electrical equipment is typically calibrated once per year, at a minimum. Adjustments are made to the calibration
frequency via a corrective action report to address complaints or to ensure credible results. A written general procedure
identifying the calibration history, records, and frequency of usage is utilized to determine any deviation from
the equipment manufacturer's recommended or Entela's usual calibration intervals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Quality Assurance (QA) Department is responsible for maintaining the calibration database, the department
monthly recall reports, and the procurement of calibration services. Each department is responsible for timely
calibration and preventive maintenance of its equipment. The QA Department retrieves or locks out any equipment
that is not turned in for calibration. New and repaired test equipment is calibrated prior to use. When a piece of equipment
is received for repair or routine calibration, its ``as received'' calibration status is noted. This status is evaluated
for its effect on testing that has been performed with that equipment to determine whether retesting is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each item of test and measuring equipment is required to have a label that depicts its calibration status. For example,
it may have a calibration label or may be labeled, ``Before Each Use'', ``Out of Calibration'', ``Out of Service'',
or ``For Reference Only''. Calibration labels identify the date when last calibrated as well as the date for the next
calibration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Repair and Calibration records are maintained for the life of the equipment in the master calibration files and on
the database computer (calibration). Calibration standards are traceable to NIST or to international standards
bodies. Primary standards include: Gage and hardness blocks, laser interferometers, and chemical references.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The QA Department issues monthly calibration recall notices and preventive maintenance reports to each department
based upon the master calibration database. The department managers are responsible for complying with any of the
requirements noted in the report. The Quality Assurance manager will remove any non-calibrated equipment and place
it in a locked storage area unless the equipment meets the criteria for extension of calibration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of test and evaluation procedures were reviewed in various ongoing program areas. The specific ongoing programs
the laboratory is involved with that identify the records required to be maintained for an investigation are followed.
These programs use ANSI/UL Standards, ASTM test procedures, the Quality Control Manual, Third Party Certification
Program (TPCP) Manual, Client Test Procedures, and Departmental Operational Procedures. These procedures contain
construction or testing parameters to be met by the product being evaluated and, as required, the chronological order
of evaluation. The staff responsible for safety testing generally consists of degreed engineers and chemists. In
most instances, the test standard provided sufficient detail for laboratory personnel to conduct a step-by-step
approach to develop repeatable and accurate test and evaluation data. Where appropriate, the test engineer provides
a narrative report along with the test data to document compliance of a product with the standard. Standardized tests
that are frequently run have a standard test data sheet available that contains the necessary information for the
laboratory technician.

Several Standard Test Procedures (STPs) were reviewed in various program areas. Entela will develop and submit additional
STPs, where necessary, prior to listing products related to these procedures. Specific program procedures and policies
are developed by the individual departments and are audited twice per year by the President or Vice President of the
laboratory. Management and the project manager are responsible for assuring that procedures are followed. These
operating and testing procedures are determined by the work order which specifies which standard(s) and provisions
are to be utilized. Operational procedures and policies are implemented through the training program at Entela,
Inc. The master copy is located in the Standards Library, with controlled copies located in each department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Present policy utilizes a technical committee and standards experts to determine the appropriate standard in evaluating
a product. Standard interpretations are developed by consensus of the technical committee. The Project Manager
distributes technical advisory letters describing standards policy on interpretation or deviation decisions
to all parties affected. The laboratory personnel are members of various organizations which develop standards
applicable to their on-going programs in the automotive, flammability, metallurgical, quality, electrical and
chemical testing areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A technical committee and standards experts determine the appropriate standard or standards to be utilized in evaluating
the product. Disagreements between the applicant and the laboratory regarding standards applicability are resolved
using the Entela Inc. Third Party Certification Committee, technical experts, and input from the standards-writing
organization. The decision of the laboratory regarding which standard is applicable is final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TPCP Manual addresses the interpretation of these standards and the appeals procedure available to a client,
when there is a disagreement with that interpretation. The TPCP Committee interprets the section of the standards,
which are also available for distribution to interested parties. Consumer inquiries and complaints are also addressed
in the TPCP Manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entela personnel serve on technical committees to enable them to be cognizant of changes to the standards with which
they are involved. The laboratory is continuing to develop committee membership in various new product areas of interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Test procedures contain the following: Instructions on equipment; preparation of test samples; standard testing
techniques; references to specific standards, including titles and dates; testing equipment and accuracies; precautionary
statements for operator safety; test data obtained, measurement resolution and data recording time; ambient conditions
and/or adverse environmental conditions; and acceptance criteria tests. These test procedures are reviewed annually
and are approved by the technical department manager and the QA manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sample test data sheets and attached work orders contain the following: Standard and clause numbers; product model
number; measuring and test equipment I.D.; test date and report number, signature of tester/reviewer; and Q.A; ambient
conditions; test observations and deviations; test data in the form of compliance, non-compliance, or the need for
further review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permanent records are compiled to document all technical and quality related activities of the Certification and
Testing Division. The system for controlling all technical and quality records is described in the Quality Assurance
Manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification reports contain the following: Name and location of submitter and factory; title, number, and
date of standard use for evaluation; file number, report date, edition number and revision date; description of product
including drawings, specifications, and photographs; conditions of product use; construction and testing narratives
which describe how the product(s) comply with the standard; tests and results of tests; deviations and technical
rationale for acceptance. The Quality Assurance Manual and the Third Party Certification Program Manual identify
the minimum information and reporting format required for an investigation. Most reports followed the required
format. Entela has documented specific procedures for the recording of any deviations and the associated technical
rationale, or for the modification of testing protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project manager, department manager, and test engineer, are responsible for the preparation and review of the
final report. The test report is written by the test engineer or senior technician. The senior technician is also responsible
for reviewing and signing the test data before it is reviewed by the project manager. A modified review process of data
sheets and reports has been instituted to ensure that all signatures are in place and that any abnormalities or unusual
test results are identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Listings are revised with replacement pages. A new report is prepared if extensive changes are required. Copies of
the listing report are given to the customer and to jurisdictional authorities, where required, and placed in follow-up
inspection files. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards updates are secured by maintaining update services for a variety of standards. For example, UL standards
quarterly index update service is subscribed to and used to verify the latest edition of their standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project manager is responsible for providing the test engineer with the latest revision of the appropriate standards.
Superseded standards are archived in the library and labeled as such, superseded standards beyond 5 years are placed
in filing boxes, labeled, and stored in records storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRTL Program checklist has been developed so that the file of a product listing is evaluated to assure its completeness
through the project manager's review of the file and use of the file checklist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety testing records (OSHA/NRTL) are to be stored with the nuclear files which are in a locked fireproof storage
room in a fireproof filing cabinet in the third building. No flammability testing is conducted in this building. A
procedure for control of files is in place to protect them from damage, theft, or records loss. Duplicate records are
not stored off site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The records are alphabetized by client. The verification and identification of test reports of listed products is
accomplished through the use of the director of certified products. A label numbering system is to be utilized for
the NRTL program that will take into account the various products, manufacturing sites, and variations of a model
line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The office manager is responsible for filing and maintaining these records. Procedures are in effect to distribute,
recall, and revise test records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Quality Assurance System consists of separate but interrelated functional areas that report directly to the
President or the Vice President of operations. The Quality Assurance Manager is responsible for the internal quality
of the laboratory and its operations, and reports directly to the President of the laboratory. The director of Quality
Assurance Services reports to the Vice President of Operations and is responsible for the various programs that address
the client's preproduction qualifications, suppliers of laboratory services, follow-up program, manufacturing
monitoring and quality assurance assessment. The individuals in the two positions assist each other in accomplishing
the workload without interfering with their job requirements or the lines of authority. The Quality Manager is independent
of operations and has the responsibility and authority for overseeing all activities related to the internal laboratory
quality program.

An internal audit program performed every six months is in place on behalf of management to determine if all operations
are complying with the requirements of the current quality systems, procedures, policy decisions, calibration
programs, test procedures, and safety programs. This audit evaluates both the operational function and the quality
assurance program at the same time, and is performed by the president or vice president of the laboratory. Personnel
interviewed in the electrical and calibration areas were actively aware of the program. The corrective action reports
and the corrective action logs showed no discrepancies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Variations and discrepancies are addressed via a Corrective Action Report (CAR). CARs not finalized in an appropriate
time frame are discussed at the directors' and managers' meetings and monitored by the laboratory President.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entela, Inc. is devoting additional resources in the quality assurance area and will review weekly all open corrective
action reports of problems and root cause analysis. A corrective action system is in place to document audit findings
and to implement corrective actions with specified time limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entela performs follow-up inspections at various facilities for other ongoing programs. Written procedures are
in place for the various programs. For example, the TPCP Manual, which is presently used in the Government Services
Administration (GSA) Furniture Certification Program, identifies the various steps, policies and procedures
that will be used in the NRTL Program. A separate manual is presently used in Entela's Certified Automotive Parts Association
(CAPA) Program. The Nuclear Program is covered under the Quality Manual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Entela, Inc. follow-up inspection procedure for the NRTL program requires quarterly inspections on an unannounced
basis at the manufacturing facility. This program is designed to assure that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Entela, Inc. mark is applied only to certified products;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. That the terms of agreement are adhered to when the Entela Inc. mark is used;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Defects noted during previous inspections have been corrected;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Document control procedures and support staff training should provide the assurance that all facility assessment
records are on file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRTL factory inspections will be performed at the rate of at least four inspections per factory per year. The frequency
varies with product volumes, types of products, and the manufacturer's prior record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When products fail to meet the requirements, the Quality Services Division takes action to either have the manufacturers
correct the defect immediately, quarantine stock until the product can be reworked or reevaluated by the Entela testing
engineer, or remove the Entela, Inc. mark from the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entela, Inc. has a standard follow-up inspection form that will be used to document the findings at the manufacturing
site. The inspector or inspecting engineer will use this form along with the follow-up inspection file for that manufacturing
site and product to evaluate the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entela, Inc. has a pre-qualification checklist for the evaluation of a manufacturing facility that will be used prior
to the factory labeling of any products in the NRTL Program, as well as a Follow-Up Service Inspection Report. The TPCP
Manual identifies the procedures required for the selection of product samples to test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entela, Inc.'s Quality Services Division will monitor products in the field, when prompted by either factory anomalies
of complaints, and investigate field complaints. Entela, Inc. reserves the right to utilize safety related public
notification and mandatory recall procedures. All consumer complaints are forwarded to the Quality Services Director,
Vice President, or President, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distribution of labels placed on products is controlled, requiring the manufacturer to obtain labels only from Entela.
These labels are then cached in a locked storage room.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An organizational chart identifies key laboratory personnel and shows the relationship between administration,
operation, and quality control. There are approximately 65 personnel in the Entela organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A written position description for each job title of personnel involved with product testing and evaluation includes
the necessary education, training, technical knowledge, and the experience required for the position. The position
description specified the extent and limitation of responsibility for the position. New position descriptions
and training programs are in place for the follow-up inspection areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written job descriptions are referenced in the Quality Control Manual for staff involved with product testing and
evaluation. These job descriptions contain minimum requirements, education, technical knowledge and experience
requirement for their respective position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The President and Vice President of Operation, who have overall responsibility for the technical operations of the
laboratory, have technical degrees. Personnel assigned to the TPCP have the necessary education, training, technical
knowledge, and experience specified by their position description. Training logs reviewed in the electrical and
in the calibration areas were current. Calibration training records showed that the calibration supervisor qualified
his staff on each piece of equipment prior to any technician being allowed to perform independent calibrations. The
training records identify each staff member and the test methods, procedures, and evaluations he or she is qualified
to perform. Continuing education and training programs are held to instruct personnel on the proper methods of testing
and evaluation. This documented training program incorporates appropriate test methods, equipment and operational
procedures, product evaluations, inspections, and technical/engineering course work, and is updated annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The laboratory has a progressive performance appraisal system that provides for self-evaluation, peer-evaluation

The laboratory has developed procedures that will enable it to accept components and materials tested and evaluated
by another NRTL laboratory. These procedures include evaluating the listing report, and reserving the right to retest
and audit the components as it deems necessary. Components tested and evaluated by Entela will fall under their follow-up
service agreement. An approved source list has been revised to include company name, address, and area of expertise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TPCP identifies the circumstances when testing and evaluation of a product may be accomplished at the client's
facility, such as when the equipment is large and not easily shipped or when specialized test facilities are required.
The TPCP also identifies the general criteria for qualifying the manufacturer's facility to include the witnessing
of the tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A procedure exists for the qualification of subcontractors for the supply of services in support of the laboratory

Preliminary Finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Entela, Inc. addressed all of the criteria which must be met for recognition as an NRTL in its initial application and
in its further correspondence. For example, the applicant submitted a list of its test equipment and instrumentation;
a roster of its personnel including resumes of those in key positions and copies of position descriptions; copies
of a typical test report; a factory inspection form and an inspection summary; a summary of its listing, labeling,
and follow-up services; a statement of its independence as a testing laboratory; appeals procedure; typical calibration
forms; and a copy of its Third Party Certification Manual and its Quality Assurance Manual. This QA Manual includes
a description of its document control; identification and control of materials, parts, and components; inspection;
test control; control of measuring and test equipment; inspection, test, and operating status; quality assurance
records; and audits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine major areas were examined in depth during the on-site laboratory evaluation: Facility; test equipment, calibration
program; test and evaluation procedures; test reports; records; quality assurance program; follow-up listing
program; and personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discrepancies noted during the on-site evaluation were adequately responded to (Ex. 3.A.(2)) prior to the preparation
of the final on-site evaluation (Ex. 3.A(1)). With the preparation of the final report, the survey team was satisfied
that the testing facility appeared to meet the necessary criteria required by the standard, and so noted in the On-Site
Review Report (Survey). (See Ex. 3.A.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following a review of the application file and the on-site survey report of the Entela facility, the NRTL Recognition
Program staff concluded that the applicant appeared to have met the requirements for recognition as a Nationally
Recognized Testing Laboratory and, therefore, recommended to the Assistant Secretary that the application the
preliminarily approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) 25 U.S.C. 2701 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 was signed into law on October 17, 1988. The IGRA established the National Indian Gaming Commission (the Commission).
Section 2710 of the IGRA authorizes the Commission to approve class II and class III tribal gaming ordinances. Section
2710 (d)(2)(B) of the IGRA as implemented by 25 CFR 522.8 (58 FR 5811 (January 22, 1993)), requires the Commission to
publish, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, approved class III gaming ordinances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IGRA requires all tribal gaming ordinances to contain the same requirements concerning ownership of the gaming
activity, use of net revenues, annual audits, health and safety, background investigations and licensing of key
employees. The Commission, therefore, believes that publication of each ordinance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be redundant and result in an unnecessary cost to the Commission. The Commission believes that publishing a
notice of approval of each class III gaming ordinance is sufficient to meet the requirements of 25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(2)(B).
Also, the Commission will make copies of approved class III ordinances available to the public upon request. Requests
can be made in writing to: National Indian Gaming Commission, 1850 M St., NW., suite 250, Washington, DC 20036.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

I. Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to clarify the meaning of DTC Rule 5. On December 13, 1993, the Commission
issued an order approving a proposed rule change by DTC relating to the eligibility of Rule 144A securities at DTC.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In the Rule 144A Order, among other things, was the statement that Rule 5, Section 1 of DTC's Rule requires DTC to determine
whether ``in light of the Federal securities laws, particularly the provisions of Rules 144, 144A, and 145, the securities,
when deposited with DTC, may be lawfully transferred by book-entry.''
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 DTC filed this proposed rule change in order to clarify that DTC Rule 5 does not require DTC to determine whether securities
deposited at DTC may be transferred lawfully pursuant to Federal securities laws.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that DTC's proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act and, specifically,
with sections 17A(b) (3) (A) and (F).
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Those sections require that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that Rule 5 does not require DTC to determine whether securities, when deposited at DTC, may be transferred lawfully
by book-entry in light of Federal securities laws) is a plausible interpretation. Prior to making specific issues
of Rule 144A securities eligible for DTC's book-entry delivery and other depository services, DTC, as part of its
procedures, requires issuers and transfer agents to make certain representations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 These representations, together with DTC's periodic review to evaluate their effectiveness, serve to indicate
that specific issues of Rule 144A securities are eligible for DTC services pursuant to the Rule 144A Order. The Commission
is satisfied that DTC's interpretation of Rule 5, along with its procedures for the acceptance of Rule 144A securities,
is consistent with DTC's obligations to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions and to protect investors and the public interest.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Company; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to An Increase in the Fixed Net Debit Cap Employed in the Depository Trust Company's Same-Day Funds Settlement System</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 1, 1993, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;13) under section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 to increase the fixed net debit cap employed in DTC's same-day funds settlement (``SDFS'') system. Notice of the proposal
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

I. Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For each participant, DTC establishes a net debit cap in its SDFS system
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 in order to assure that DTC's liquidity resources are sufficient to complete settlement if an SDFS participant fails
to settle its net debit obligation. Each participant's net debit in the SDFS system is limited throughout the processing
day by a net debit cap that is the lesser of: (1) The adjustable net debit cap, which is a multiple of the participant's
deposits to the SDFS participants fund, or (2) the fixed net debit cap.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The fixed net debit cap is set at 75% of: (1) the aggregate cash deposits to the SDFS participants fund and (2) DTC's internal
and external lines of credit. The fixed net debit cap is currently set at $387 million.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For a detailed description of DTC's SDFS system, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26051 (August 31, 1988),
53 FR 34852 (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;88&hyph;06) (order granting permanent approval of the SDFS system).

As of February 15, 1994, there were 238 participants in the SDFS program. The fixed net debit cap is the operative cap
for twenty-two of these SDFS participants. Telephone conversation between Carl H. Urist, Deputy General Counsel,
DTC, and Peter R. Geraghty, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission (February 15, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DTC has on deposit approximately 72% of the commercial paper (``CP'') outstanding in the U.S. and expects that virtually
all CP outstanding in the U.S., except CP that is in direct issuers' proprietary book-entry systems, will be included
in DTC's CP program sometime in 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the anticipated increase in volume of commercial paper settlements in its SDFS system, DTC is concerned that
the fixed net debit cap at its current level could have the undesirable effect of temporarily blocking substantial
numbers of book-entry deliveries. To prevent such occurrences, DTC has decided to increase its external committed
lines of credit by $250 million in order to raise the fixed net debit cap of SDFS participants that elect to share DTC's
cost of obtaining the increase in the external lines of credit. The $250 million increase in external lines of credit
should raise the fixed net debit to approximately $574 million. DTC believes that the securities resources available
to it to collateralize any borrowing it should have to make under the increased external lines of credit are more than
adequate.

DTC's line of credit agreements provide that any borrowing may be collateralized by securities in the account of a
failing participant as well as by securities that have been deposited by DTC participants to the SDFS participants
fund. On February 1, 1994, deposits to the SDFS participants fund included securities having a market value of approximately
$627 million. Letter from Richard B. Nesson, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, DTC, to Jonathan Kallman,

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding
of securities and funds which are in its custody or control or for which it is responsible.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission previously acknowledged the risk reduction benefits of the net debit cap in the order granting permanent
approval of DTC's CP program.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission continues to believe that the net debit cap is a integral part of the risk reduction measures taken by
DTC to protect the securities and funds in its SDFS system.

For a detailed description and discussion of the SDFS system and the CP program's risk controls, refer to Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 30986 (July 31, 1992), 57 FR 35856 (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;92&hyph;01) (order approving
implementation of CP program).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) also requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that increasing the fixed net debit
cap should help promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in the SDFS system by decreasing
the possibility that book-entry deliveries could be temporarily blocked from processing due to a participant exceeding
its fixed net debit cap.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements
of the Act, of section 17A of the Act in particular, and of the rules and regulations thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;13) be, and hereby is, approved.

MCC and MSTC propose to change their Rules and By-Laws to: (1) Allow for the establishment of additional communities;
(2) require MCC and MSTC to consult with at least one member of the Risk Assessment Committee before ceasing to act for
a participant; (3) establish a Risk Assessment Committee; (4) modify their procedures relating to appeals; (5) add
provisions relating to suits against MCC and MSTC and their employees; and (6) add a provision that requires MCC or
MSTC participants, in certain circumstances, to pay MCC or MSTC all reasonable expenses they incur in defending a
legal proceeding instigated by the participants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In their filings with the Commission, MCC and MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and statutory basis
for the proposed rule changes and discussed any comments received on the proposals. The test of these statements may
be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. MCC and MSTC have prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A),
(B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule changes is to amend various by-laws and rules of MCC and MSTC to define participants'
rights and obligations more precisely and to give MCC and MSTC more flexibility and protection in dealing with violations
of their respective rules. By-laws will be added to allow MCC and MSTC to establish committees either through their
respective by-laws or rules or by the board of directors. Rules will be added to: (1) Establish a Risk Assessment Committee
for MCC and MSTC; (2) require MCC and MSTC to consult with at least one member of the Risk Assessment Committee prior
to ceasing to act for a participant; and (3) expand the types of events that permit MCC and MSTC to cease to act for a participant
to any instance where a participant poses a financial risk to MCC or MSTC. These changes will provide independent input
to management in its decision-making process while still providing MCC and MSTC the flexibility to act quickly if
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To clarify that MCC and MSTC have the authority to establish the new Risk Assessment Committee, the proposed rules
will amend their by-laws to add a provision that expressly permits MCC and MSTC to establish committees by their rules
or by-laws or through their boards of directors. The Risk Assessment Committee will hear all appeals under the applicable
rules. The proposed rules specifically provide that prior participation by a member of the Risk Assessment Committee
in any inquiry, consultation, examination, or investigation of the matter under appeal will not disqualify the Committee
member from hearing the appeal. The proposed rules replace current rules which require the board of directors to appoint
a panel to hear an appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCC and MSTC also will add provisions to their rules that will give them greater flexibility in the decision to cease
to act for a participant. Specifically, these provisions will allow MCC and MSTC to cease to act for a participant if
there are reasonable grounds to believe that the participant poses a financial risk to MCC or to MSTC even if the firm
itself is not in financial difficulty. These provisions will provide MCC and MSTC more flexibility in reducing risk
to themselves and to other participants.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules also will mandate a formal standard of review to be applied in appeals beyond the Risk Assessment
Committee review. Currently, either MCC's or MSTC's board may in its discretion reverse, modify, or remand for further
consideration any decision adverse to an appellant. Under the proposed standard, neither board shall reverse, modify,
or remand for further consideration any decision adverse to an appellant if the factual conclusions in the Risk Assessment
Committee's decision are supported by substantial evidence and if the decision itself is not arbitrary, capricious,
or an abuse of discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed rules add provisions relating to MCC's and MSTC's liability and suits filed against MCC and
MSTC and their employees. The possibility of suit against individual staff members of MCC or MSTC acting on company
business makes it impossible for such persons to perform properly their duties. The proposed rules will prohibit
an MCC or MSTC participant from suing any officer, director, employee, or agent of MCC or MSTC, of the Chicago Stock
Exchange, or of any of their affiliates, if such person is acting on the business of MCC, MSTC, the Exchange, or of any
of their affiliates. These proposed rules will not prohibit a participant from suing MCC or MSTC as a result of the actions
of these individuals; they merely will prohibit suits against individuals acting in their official capacities.
The proposed rules also will limit MCC's and MSTC's liability to participants to situations where MCC or MSTC acted
willfully or with gross negligence. Finally, the proposals will add new provisions that require an MCC or MSTC participant
that fails to prevail in a legal proceeding instigated by that participant against MCC, MSTC, or any of its officers,
directors, committee members, employees, or agents to pay MCC or MSTC all reasonable expenses, including attorneys'
fees, incurred by MCC or MSTC in defending the proceeding if those expenses exceed $20,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule changes are consistent with Section 17A of the Act in that they will facilitate the safeguarding
of securities and funds which are in MCC's and MSTC's custody or control or for which they are responsible.

I. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal establishes procedures for the deposit, processing, and withdrawal of the registered form of interchangeable
municipal bonds at MSTC.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 (Prior to this proposal, MSTC accepted the bearer form of interchangeable municipal bonds.) Deposits of the registered
form of interchangeable municipal bonds are maintained along with deposits of the bearer form in MSTC's Bearer System
and lose their registered identities. Interchangeable municipal bonds are eligible for deposit at MSTC only in the
MSTC Bearer System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Interchangeable municipal bonds are municipal security issues that may be held in registered form or bearer form
and may be converted from one form to the other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal also establishes procedures for the withdrawal of interchangeable municipal bonds from MSTC's Bearer
System. A participant effecting a withdrawal of interchangeable municipal bonds from MSTC may request certificates
in either bearer or registered form, and MSTC, while offering no guarantee, will attempt to fill such requests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with section 17A of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 require that a clearing agency be organized and its rules designed to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds that are in its custody
and control or for which it is responsible. The Commission believes that this proposal is consistent with those sections
of the Act because it facilitates the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions by
providing an automated, centralized location where MSTC participants can maintain both the registered and bearer
form of their interchangeable municipal bonds. Furthermore, MSTC's Bearer System, along with the modifications
allowing for the processing of the registered form of interchangeable municipal bonds, has been designed to assure
that MSTC fulfills its safeguarding obligations under the Act.

III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of
the Act, particularly with those of section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;89&hyph;02) be, and hereby is, approved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis, for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 6, 1992, the Commission promulgated rule 17Ad&hyph;15 which permits transfer agents to reject signature
guarantees from eligible guarantor institutions that are not part of a signature guarantee program as defined in
Rule 17Ad&hyph;15. This new rule render's MSTC's Signature Distribution Program and Signature Guarantee Program
obsolete. Therefore, to avoid costs that produce not benefits, MSTC seeks to eliminate its Signature Distribution
and Signature Guarantee Programs and to delete MSTC Rule 5, Sections 1 and 2 which govern these programs.

I. Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal will limit or eliminate the potential monetary liability of MSTC directors to the fullest extent permissible
under Illinois law.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed change is based on Section 2.10(b)(3) of the Illinois Business Corporation Act, under which MSTC is organized.
That section allows corporations to adopt provisions in their articles of incorporation that limit or eliminate
the potential monetary liability of directors under certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, the proposal adds the following language to Article X of MSTC's Articles of Incorporation and to Article
IV, &sect;1 of MSTC's By-Laws:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the fullest extent that the Illinois Business Corporation Act, as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter
be amended, permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of Directors, no Director of the Corporation shall
be liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director, except
where such liability arises directly or indirectly as a result of a violation of the federal securities laws. No amendment
to or repeal of this Article shall apply to or have any effect on the liability of any Director of the Corporation for
or with respect to any acts or omissions of such Director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General corporate law imposes a fiduciary duty of care upon each corporate director. This duty of care requires a director
to exercise informed business judgment in good faith and to act with an honest belief that the action taken is in the
best interest of the corporation. The proposal does not eliminate an MSTC director's duty of care but rather limits
the personal liability of an MSTC director to MSTC or its shareholders should the director fail through negligence
or gross negligence to satisfy his or her duty of care.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>

<FOOTNAME>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
MSTC's proposal limits a director's liability even if that director had been grossly negligent provided that the
director exercised informed business judgment in good faith and acted with an honest belief that the action taken
was in the best interest of the corporation. Because there has been no judicial interpretation on the scope of the applicable
Illinois legislation, it is possible that an Illinois court may find as a matter of law that a director cannot act in
a manner that is both grossly negligent and in good faith.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal does not limit a director's liability in instances where liability arises directly or indirectly as
a result of a violation of federal securities laws. The proposal also does not eliminate equitable remedies such as
rescission or injunctive actions. Moreover, it does not eliminate the liability of an officer of MSTC for actions
taken in that capacity even if the officer is also a director. Finally, the proposal does not affect the liability of
a director for acts or omissions that occurred prior to approval of the proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and in particular with Section 17A(b)(3)(C)
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 of the Act in that it helps to ensure the fair representation of shareholders and participants in the administration
of MSTC. By limiting or eliminating the potential monetary liability of MSTC directors for actions they take within
the scope of their employment, the proposal should guarantee that qualified candidates are not discouraged from
becoming MSTC directors. This should enable MSTC to maintain a variety of qualified candidates from which to choose
directors and in particular should help MSTC retain directors who are fairly representative of MSTC's shareholders
and participants.

On December 3, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The rule change amends Article III, Section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice (``Rules'') to exempt certain money market
mutual funds from the disclosure required by Section 26(d)(4) of the Rules. In particular, the rule change exempts
funds with annual asset-based sales charges equal to or less than .25 of 1% (25 basis points) of average net assets from
the requirement to disclose in its prospectus that long-term shareholders may pay more than the economic equivalent
of the permitted maximum frontend sales charges.

The NASD originally filed the proposed rule change on August 3, 1993. On December 3, 1993, the NASD filed Amendment
No. 1 in response to concerns raised by the Commission. Amendment No. 1 was reflected in the Commission's Notice of
Filing. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33352 (Dec. 16, 1993), 58 FR 67884 (Dec. 22, 1993). On February 9, 1994,
the NASD submitted Amendment No. 2 which included a response to the comment letters received by the Commission and
the results of the membership vote on the proposed rule change. The membership approved the rule change with 1,874
approving, 242 disapproving and 9 not voting, of all valid ballots received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 7, 1992, the Commission approved an NASD rule change concerning investment company sales charges.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 As currently drafted, section 26(d)(4) of these new rules require any investment company assessing asset-based
sales charges to disclose in its prospectus that ``long-term shareholders may pay more than the economic equivalent
of the maximum front-end sales charges permitted by this section.''

As the July 7, 1993 effective date for the NASD's new rule approached, the NASD received several applications for exemption
from section 26(d)(4)'s disclosure requirement. The applicants sought the exemption based on their assessment
that section 26(d)(4) requires the disclosure even if the statement may not be true for a particular mutual fund. According
to the NASD, the applicants pointed out that in the case of a money market mutual fund, a high probability exists that
the statement will be inaccurate because such funds generally have very low asset-based sales charges, and an investor
would have to be a shareholder for an extremely long time before the disclosure would be accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

II. Description of the Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD agreed with the arguments of the applicants and concluded that requiring funds to include disclosure statements
in the situations identified by the applicants does not serve any identifiable purpose and does not advance any recognizable
regulatory interest. Accordingly, the NASD filed a proposed rule change to amend section 26(d)(4) to exempt certain
money market mutual funds from the disclosure requirement.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The exemption is limited to money market mutual funds with asset-based sales charges equal to or less than .25 of 1%
of average net assets per annum.

All three commenters supported the NASD's proposed exemption but suggested certain changes. Two commenters suggested
that the exemption not be limited to money market mutual funds but also extend to any fund where the disclosure might
be misleading or inaccurate.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 One of these commenters suggested that the NASD establish a test to determine whether the disclosure would be required,
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 and the other recommended allowing the funds to assess the surrounding circumstances to determine whether disclosure
would be necessary.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 The third commenter argued that the disclosure should be expanded to include a statement that ``short term shareholders
will pay sales charges less than the maximum permitted by (the rules).''

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD has determined not to incorporate the suggested changes and noted that it crafted the exemption for money
market mutual funds because these funds typically charge low asset-based sales charges and have a relatively low
return on investment. Thus, that an investor would pay the economic equivalent of the maximum permitted front-end
sales charge is unlikely. In addition, in the NASD's assessment, the current tendency is for investors to use money
market mutual funds for short-term purposes, for example, as checking accounts or temporary holding areas for investment
funds and, therefore, these funds should be exempted from the section 26(d)(4) disclosure requirement.

IV. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the NASD's rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, therefore, has determined to approve the rule change. Specifically,
the Commission believes that the rule change is consistent with Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 This section requires, among other things, that the NASD's rules be designed to promote just and equitable principles
of trade and to protect investors and the public interest.

The NASD adopted section 26(d)(4) with the intent of providing adequate disclosure to readers of prospectuses of
investment companies assessing asset-based sales charges. While the current rule only states that shareholders
may pay more than the economic equivalent of the maximum front-end sales charges, by creating an exemption from this
disclosure requirement for money market mutual funds, the rule provides more accurate disclosure to readers of these
prospectuses. With respect to money market mutual funds, the disclosure is unnecessary, potentially misleading
and serves no regulatory or investor protection interest.

In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with
the requirements of the Act.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 19, 1992, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 therunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change regarding the Exchange's odd-lot limit order handling procedures. The Exchange addresses
several potential abuses of the procedures through the issuance of an Information Memo to all Members and Member Organizations.
On November 20, 1992, the NYSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rule change was published for comment, as amended, in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31615 (December
17, 1992), 57 FR 61137 (December 23, 1992). No comments were received on the proposal. On January 21, 1994, the NYSE
submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 For the reasons discussed below, this order approves the proposed rule change, as amended, including Amendment No.
2 on an accelerated basis.

See letter from Brian M. McNamara, Managing Director, Market Surveillance, NYSE, to Diana Luka-Hopson, Branch Chief,
Commission, dated November 16, 1992. Amendment No. 1 clarified the Exchange's proposal by providing an example of
a pattern of activity that could suggest day trading of odd-lot limit orders.

II. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In February 1991, the Exchange implemented changes to its odd-lot
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 order handling procedures.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The changes were intended to afford pricing benefits to members and member organizations' customers and to provide
an inexpensive and efficient order execution system compatible with traditional odd-lot investing practices of
smaller investors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
An odd-lot market order is an order of less than a unit of trading to buy, sell, or sell short, which carries no further
qualifying notations. The normal trading unit, or round lot, is 100 shares.

See NYSE Rule 124 for a complete description of the NYSE's odd-lot order execution system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One change established the use of ``Best Pricing Quote'' for pricing odd-lot market orders. This assures that an odd-lot
market order sent to the Exchange for execution will be priced on the basis of the best prevailing national market system
quotation for that security.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The second change eliminated all differentials on odd-lot limit orders entered by member organizations through
the Exchange's system for odd-lots.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the NYSE, however, the efficiencies sought to be obtained by eliminating the differential charge on
odd-lot limit orders would only be achieved if the odd-lot system was used in a manner consistent with traditional
odd-lot investing practices of smaller investors rather than as a professional trading vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange has identified and informed its members about several practices that it believes are not consistent
with traditional odd-lot investing practices and whose use constitutes an abuse of the odd-lot system. These practices
include unbundling of round-lots for the purpose of entering odd-lot limit orders; failure to aggregate odd-lot
orders into round lots; entry of both buy and sell odd-lot limit orders for purposes of capturing the spread in the stock;
and order entry practices intended to circumvent the round-lot auction market.

See NYSE Information memo No. 91&hyph;29, July 25, 1991. See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31048 (August
18, 1992), 57 FR 38706 (August 26, 1992), Odd-lot limit orders are executed upon the occurrence of the first round-lot
transaction in the security, which is at or better than the specified limit, following receipt of the order by the odd-lot
system. See NYSE Rule 124.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange's proposal identifies additional types of odd-lot limit order trading which the Exchange believes
are not consistent with traditional odd-lot investment activity and should not be permitted to use the odd-lot limit
order service. Specifically, the proposal would preclude the use of the odd-lot limit order service,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 for (1) index arbitrage, (2) other types of program trading,
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 or (3) any pattern of activity that would suggest day trading. Examples of this latter practice could include among
other things, entering multiple off-lot limit orders to buy and sell the same security on the same day or odd-lot limit
orders to buy and sell a group of stocks on the same day where it appears or is established that the intent is to capture
the spread in these stocks by buying on the bid and selling on the offer.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Upon approval of this proposed rule change, the Exchange intends to advise its members and member organizations,
through an Information Memo, that these types of trading practices may not be effectuated by means of the odd-lot limit
order service.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Such trading would not be precluded from using the odd-lot system if odd-lot market orders were utilized. Also, such
prohibitions do not extend to PRLs (part of round lots) because they are executed outside of the odd-lot system.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange does permit odd-lot limit orders to be entered in conjunction with a program trade where such orders consist
in the aggregate of a relatively small part of the overall program. The term program trading is defined in NYSE Rule
80A as either index arbitrage or any trading strategy involving the related purchase or sale of a group or basket of
15 or more publicly traded securities that have a total fair market value of $1,000,000 or more.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange does recognize, however, that some types of buying and selling on the same day may be appropriate and cites
as an example buying stock using an odd-lot limit order and subsequently entering a stop loss sell order against that
position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing the NYSE stated that the limitations on use of the odd-lot limit order system are intended to address specific
types of trading activity, and are not intended to limit access to, or use of, the system by individual market participants
or any class of market participants for any authorized use of the system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal member organizations will be expected to establish appropriate systems to monitor odd-lot activity
to ensure that the practices noted in the Information Memo are not engaged in. The Information Memo makes clear that
the Exchange intends to initiate appropriate regulatory action if it finds that member organizations have permitted
such trading practices, either for proprietary accounts or for the accounts of customers.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NYSE's odd-lot order execution system is intended to provide efficient execution of odd-lot orders at the best
prices available.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission agrees with the NYSE that the odd-lot limit order trading practices identified in the proposed Information
Memo are not consistent with traditional odd-lot limit order investing practices. Such practices could undermine
the integrity of the system and contravene the odd-lot order system's purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

See, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28837 (January 29, 1991), 56 FR 5660 (February 5, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this context, the Commission notes that the NYSE's odd-lot order trading system is predicated on the specialists'
willingness to provide execution and price guarantees to odd-lot orders, the majority of which are entered for smaller
retail accounts. These transactions are too small to be handled efficiently through the regular Exchange auction
process. These orders generally are used by retail investors to buy or sell a small amount of stock and are not used in
short term trading strategies. As a result, Exchange specialists are able to provide execution guarantees to odd-lot
limit orders without charging an additional handling fee. The use of the system as a day trading vehicle or as part of
program trades to capture the bid ask spread through odd-lot limit orders could reduce specialists' willingness
to provide cost-efficient executions of odd-lot limit orders. Accordingly, it is reasonable for the NYSE to preclude
use of its odd-lot limit order system for index arbitrage, program trading, and day trading. Ensuring the odd-lot
limit order system is only utilized for the types of orders it was intended to accommodate will help to ensure the continued
economic liability of the system which should ultimately benefit all investors consistent with section 6(b)(5)
of the Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NYSE has been careful in formulating the Information Memo to prohibit only those transactions that would abuse
the odd-lot limit order execution guarantees. For example, the Information Memo does not preclude market participants
from entering odd-lot market orders for index arbitrage, program trading, or day trading. Because the Commission
believes the proposal clearly identifies and prohibits certain strategies that can result in abuse of the NYSE's
odd-lot limit order system, yet still allows market participants to have such orders executed by entering odd-lot
market orders rather than limit orders, the Commission believes that the proposal will not unfairly limit access
to the NYSE's market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for accelerated approval of Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the
thirtieth day after publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 2 modifies the proposal to make certain
technical and clarifying adjustments to the proposed rule change but leaves the overall structure and purpose of
the proposal unchanged. We also note that no comments were received on the proposal as noticed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of sections 11A
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 and 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 11A(a)(1)(C)(i) mandate that
it is in the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly
markets to assure economically efficient execution of securities transactions. The Commission further believes
the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect
investors and the public, in that the proposal will ensure the continued pricing and execution efficiencies provided
by the NYSE's odd-lot order system by identifying and prohibiting certain odd-lot limit order trading strategies
that are not consistent with traditional odd-lot transactions.

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on January 18, 1994, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') and The Intermarket Clearing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule changes will eliminate the ability of a clearing member of both OCC and ICC (``joint clearing member'')
that has elected to cross-net its obligations arising from foreign currency options and futures to select ICC as its
designated clearing organization (``DCO'') in settling such obligations. Under the proposed rule changes, only
OCC will be able to act as the DCO in settling such obligations.

In its filing with the Commission, OCC and ICC have included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the

may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC and ICC have prepared summaries, set forth in sections

1. Cross-Netting Under Current Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under OCC and ICC rules, a joint clearing member may elect to cross-net its OCC exercise and assignment settlement
obligations in OCC-cleared foreign currency options (``OCC obligations'') with its settlement obligations in
ICC-cleared foreign currency futures (``ICC obligations'') on the same foreign currency. Cross-netting occurs
when OCC obligations settle on a date that also is a delivery date for ICC obligations. Because such dates coincide
only one day each month, cross-netting is performed only one day each month.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, a joint clearing member that has elected to settle by cross-netting may select either OCC or ICC as its DCO
and will settle its cross-netted obligations with its DCO in accordance with the rules of the DCO. (OCC and ICC have
virtually identical rules regarding the settlement of foreign currency obligations.) The DCO, in turn, performs
its ordinary clearance and settlement activities and acts as agent for the opposite clearing organization in settling
the cross-netted obligations.

For a more detailed description of cross-netting, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24781 (August 6, 1987),

The agreement of one clearing organization to act as agent for the other is contained in the Mutual Agency Agreement
for Foreign Currency Settlement (``Mutual Agency Agreement'') between OCC and ICC. The Mutual Agency Agreement
sets forth the rights and obligations of OCC and ICC in effecting cross-netted settlements and the effect of the default
of a joint clearing member on such rights and obligations.

2. The Proposed Rule Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ICC no longer desires to be a cross-netting DCO, and therefore, OCC and ICC have proposed to eliminate the ability of
a joint clearing member to select ICC as a DCO. These proposed rule changes will have no effect: (1) On the basic procedures
under which cross-netted obligations are settled or (2) upon any joint clearing member because no joint clearing
member has ever selected ICC as its cross-netting DCO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To accomplish the proposed rule changes, OCC and ICC will amend OCC Rule 1605(c) and ICC Rule 1205(c). The two rules
deal with the cross-netting of foreign currency obligations and will be modified to state that henceforth only OCC
will be the DCO and effect the settlement of such obligations. OCC and ICC also will delete from OCC By-Laws Article
XV, Section 1 and from ICC Rule 1202 the term and definition of ``designated clearing organization.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OCC and ICC will replace the existing Mutual Agency Agreement between OCC and ICC with a proposed Agreement for Cross-Netting
Foreign Currency Settlements (``Cross-Netting Agreement''). The proposed Cross-Netting Agreement, which is
based on the Mutual Agency Agreement, has been drafted by OCC and ICC to implement the above-described rule changes.
Specifically, the Cross-Netting Agreement provides: (1) That OCC and ICC will furnish a form notice by which a joint
clearing member may elect to cross-net its OCC and ICC obligations and which will provide that only OCC will effect
the cross-netted settlements; (2) that OCC agrees to act as agent for ICC in effecting cross-netted settlements with
a joint clearing member; (3) that neither OCC nor ICC will change its rules relating to the margining and settling of
foreign currency obligations without the consent of the other; and (4) the settlement, default, indemnity, and termination
procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Cross-Netting Agreement, the settlement and default procedures will remain unchanged except that only
OCC will be authorized to effect the cross-netting settlements. Likewise, the terms of indemnity between OCC and
ICC will remain unchanged except for the fact that OCC will no longer indemnify ICC for actions taken by ICC as agent
for OCC in effecting cross-netting settlements. Finally, the terms for terminating the Cross-Netting Agreement
will remain unchanged except that the notice requirement between the two parties will be shortened from ninety days
to thirty days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCC and ICC state the proposed rule changes are consistent with the Act and in particular with section 17A of the Act
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 in that the rule changes neither adversely affect the safeguarding of securities or funds in the custody or control
of OCC or ICC or for which they are responsible nor significantly affect the rights or obligations of OCC, ICC, or those
joint clearing members that have elected cross-netting.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Hillhaven Corporation, Inc.,

February 25, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hillhaven Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the
following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock, preferred stock purchase rights
and convertible subordinated debentures are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's
common stock and preferred share purchase rights commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on November
2, 1993 and concurrently therewith such securities were suspended from trading on the Amex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock and preferred share purchase rights from listing on the Amex, the
Company considered the direct and indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its securities
on the NYSE and on the Amex. The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock
and preferred share purchase rights and believes that dual listing would fragment the market for its securities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before March 18, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchange and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

Extension of the Restriction on the Use of United States Passport for Travel To, In, or Through Lebanon
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 26, 1987, pursuant to the authority of 22 U.S.C. 211a and Executive Order 11295 (31 FR 10603), and in accordance
with 22 CFR 51.73(a)(3), all United States passports, with the exception of passports of immediate family members
of hostages in Lebanon, were declared invalid for travel to, in, or through Lebanon unless specifically validated
for such travel. This action was taken because the situation in Lebanon was so chaotic that American citizens there
could not be considered safe from terrorist acts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there continues to be improvement in the security situation, review of the situation there has led me to conclude
that Lebanon continues to be an area ``*&blank;*&blank;* where there is imminent danger to the public health or the
physical safety of United States travelers'' within the meaning of 22 U.S.C. 211a and 22 CFR 51.73(a)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, all United States passports shall remain invalid for travel to, in, or through Lebanon unless specifically
validated for such travel under the authority of the Secretary of State.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by the Capital Region Airport Authority, Lansing, Michigan, under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety
and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;193) and 14 CFR part 150. These findings are made in recognition of
the description of Federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1980). On June 29, 1993,
the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by the Capital Region Airport Authority under part 150 were
in compliance with applicable requirements. On January 21, 1994, the Assistant Administrator for Airports approved
the Capital City Airport noise compatibility program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of the recommendations of the program were approved. A total of nine (9) measures were included in the Capital Region
Airport Authority recommended program. Of the nine (9) measures, two (2) are listed as ``Noise Abatement Plan Measures,''
two (2) are listed as ``Program Management Measures,'' and five (5) are listed as ``Land Use Management Plan.'' The

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for Capital City
Airport, effective January 21, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program
which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in part 150 and the Act, and is limited to
the following determinations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR part 150;

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types of classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the Federal Government; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific limitations with respect to the FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated
in FAR part 150, &sect;150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Detroit Airports District Office in Belleville, Michigan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Capital Region Airport Authority submitted to the FAA in 1993 noise exposure maps, descriptions, and other documentation
produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from 1990 and 1992. The Capital City Airport noise
exposure maps were determined by the FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements on June 29, 1993. Notice
of this determination was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on July 26, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Capital City Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions designed for
phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to the
year 1996. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as described
in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on July 27, 1993, and was required by a provision
of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other then the use of new flight procedures for noise
control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period would have been deemed to be an approval
of such program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submitted program contained nine (9) proposed actions for noise mitigation. The FAA completed its review and
determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied. The overall
program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administrator for Airports effective January 21, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outright approval was granted for all nine (9) of the specific program elements. The nine (9) measures include: Informal
Preferential Runway Use Program, Voluntary Compliance of Phase-Out of Stage 2 Aircraft, Airport Zoning, Environmental
Review, Revision of Building Code, Real Estate Disclosure, Local Government Comprehensive Plans, Noise Abatement
Officer, and Provisions for Revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports
on January 21, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and documents which comprised the
submittal to the FAA, are available for review at the following locations:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the Illinois Department of Transportation, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
on a proposal to improve traffic circulation around Macomb in McDonough County, Illinois. The proposed action involves
the construction of a four-lane, access-controlled, divided highway. The length will be dependent on the results
of the study and a chosen bypass location. The area being studied will encompass Macomb, Illinois for three miles to
the south, five miles to the north, eight miles to the west, and five miles to the east.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action will support economic development in west-central Illinois by providing improved traffic circulation,
safer and more efficient access to the urban area, a divided highway design for high operating speeds and system continuity
from Quincy to Macomb. Primary environmental resources that may be impacted are local property tax income, agricultural
land, and wetlands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives under consideration include no action and a new four-lane, fully access-controlled facility on new
alignment. Interchanges will be provided at major high-volume roadways. Several alignment alternatives will be
evaluated for the proposed project to best serve traffic circulation to and around Macomb.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scoping process undertaken as part of this proposed project will include distribution of a scoping information
packet, coordination with appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, and review sessions as needed. A formal
scoping meeting is not planned. Further details of the proposed project and a scoping information packet may be obtained
from one of the contact persons listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the full range of issues related to the proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
a comprehensive public involvement program will be undertaken. A public meeting concerning the proposed action
will be held in the study area prior to the public hearing. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the meeting
and hearing. The Draft EIS will be available for public agency review and comment and suggestions are invited from
all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the
FHWA or IDOT contact persons.

The FHWA is issuing this notice to inform the public that an environmental impact statement (EIS) will not be prepared
for a proposed road improvement project on Prince of Wales Island in Alaska. The scope of the proposed improvements
to the North Prince of Wales Highway has been significantly reduced. An EIS will not be prepared because of the reduced
potential for significant environmental impacts to result from this project.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The new project scope involves reconstruction of the section of North Prince of Wales Road between Coffman Cove junction
(M.P. 68.78) and the Naukati junction (M.P. 76.75). This project will correct substandard road features such as narrow
width, poor alignment, poor road surface, and unsafe roadside conditions in the project area. The Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) is considering two alternatives in addition to a ``no action'' alternative. One alternative
would widen and realign this section to an 60 km/h (40 MPH) standard. The other alternative would widen and realign
the section to a 80 km/h (50 MPH) standards. Both alternatives include resurfacing the roadbeds with gravel. This
revised proposal is based on written comments and the results of public meetings held in 1993 regarding improvement
of roads on Prince of Wales Island. Members of the public and agency representatives discussed potential alternatives
and identified relevant issues at these meetings. Input received indicates there is not strong support at this time
for new road construction on the east side of the island to meet the stated need. A Scoping Report is available from FHWA
which documents the meetings held by FHWA and input received.

Section I: Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Eighteenth Annual Report to Congress summarizes the 1993 activities of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) regarding implementation of applicable Sections of Title V: ``Improving Automotive Fuel
Efficiency,'' of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972 (15 U.S.C. 1901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seg.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), as amended (the Act). Section 502(a)(2) of the Act requires submission of a report each year. Included in this report
are sections summarizing rulemaking activities during 1993 and a discussion of the use of advanced automotive technology
by the industry as required by section 305, Title III, of the Department of Energy Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95&hyph;238).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title V of the Act requires the Secretary of Transportation to administer a program for regulating the fuel economy
of new passenger cars and light trucks in the United States. The authority to administer the program was delegated
by the Secretary to the Administrator of NHTSA, 49 CFR 1.50(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA's responsibilities in the fuel economy area include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Establishing and amending average fuel economy standards for manufacturers of passenger cars and light trucks,
as necessary;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Promulgating regulations concerning procedures, definitions, and reports necessary to support the fuel economy
standards;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Considering petitions for exemption from established fuel economy standards by low volume manufacturers (those
producing fewer than 10,000 passenger cars annually worldwide) and establishing alternative standards for them;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Preparing annual reports to Congress on the fuel economy program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Enforcing fuel economy standards and regulations; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Responding to petitions concerning domestic production by foreign manufacturers and other matters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Passenger car fuel economy standards were established by Congress for Model Year (MY) 1985 and thereafter at a level
of 27.5 miles per gallon (mpg). NHTSA is authorized to amend the standard above or below that level. Standards for light
trucks were established by NHTSA for MYs 1979 through 1995. NHTSA set a combined standard of 20.6 mpg for light truck
fuel economy standard for MY 1995. All current standards are listed in Table I&hyph;1.

The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (AMFA) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;494, October 14, 1988), amended the Motor Vehicle
Information and Cost Savings Act under Section 513_Manufacturing Incentives for Automobiles. AMFA promotes the
use of methanol, ethanol, and natural gas as transportation fuels, and it provides corporate average fuel economy
(CAFE) incentives for the vehicles that can use alternative fuels. AMFA provides CAFE benefits for manufacturers
who produce both dedicated and dual energy alternative fuel vehicles in MYs 1993 through 2004, and the benefits may
be extended through MY 2008. Dual energy automobiles are capable of operating on alcohol and either gasoline or diesel
fuel. Natural gas dual energy automobiles are capable of operating on natural gas and either gasoline or diesel fuel.
A fleet including dual energy automobiles which meets the applicable range or dedicated alternative fuel automobiles
qualify to have their CAFE calculated using a special procedure that considers the petroleum content of the alternative
fuel. Under that procedure, a relatively high fuel economy figure is assigned the vehicles capable of operating on
alternative fuels. Section 513 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972, was revised by the Energy
Policy Act of 1992, to expand the definition of manufacturing incentives for automobiles by including gaseous alternative
fuels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers the fuel economy calculations for passenger vehicles, including
alternative fuel vehicles. EPA will publish the final rules for alternative fuel vehicles which contain the special
CAFE adjustments for these vehicles. The majority of the manufacturers of these alternative fuel vehicles described
below are awaiting guidance from EPA to receive special CAFE credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In MY 1993, several manufacturers demonstrated the capability of producing alternative fuel vehicles. Although
production of these passenger vehicles was not large, alternative fuels are advantageous in reducing hydrocarbon,
carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen emissions at a relatively low cost and providing higher octane ratings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford is the only manufacturer that reported a special CAFE calculation for its flexible fuel passenger automobiles.
A flexible fuel vehicle is capable of operating on alcohol, gasoline, or any combination of these fuels from the same
tank and without the driver taking any additional actions. The following alternative fuel vehicles were produced
in MY 1993:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;GM manufactured two alternative fuel vehicles: methanol (M85) and ethanol (E85) Luminas. GM projected producing
a total of 500 of these flexible fuel vehicles. The M85 fuel has a content of 85 percent methanol fuel and 15 percent gasoline.
The E85 fuel consists of 85 percent ethanol fuel and 15 percent gasoline. These vehicles have the flexibility to run
either on the alternative fuels or gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ford included an alcohol flexible fuel passenger automobile in its MY 1993 fleet, which was reported in its
midmodel year report. The Taurus, a midsize passenger car, achieved a fuel economy of 42.4 mpg when adjusted for the
alternative fuel. Ford projected producing 2,000 of these flexible fuel passenger vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Chrysler included two flexible fuel passenger vehicles, Spirit and Acclaim, in its MY 1993 fleet. Chrysler
projected manufacturing a total of 5,427 of these vehicles. The fuel economy for both these flexible fuel passenger
vehicles is 28.2 mpg, when operating on gasoline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After Chrysler and GM receive special CAFE calculations for their alternative fuel vehicles, the current fuel economies
of these companies will increase slightly. The relatively low volumes of these vehicles in the GM and Chrysler fleets
will preclude any significant CAFE adjustment.

The fuel economy achievements for domestic and foreign manufacturers in MY 1992 were updated to include final EPA
calculations, where available, since the publication of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Seventeenth annual Report to the Congress. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These fuel economy achievements and current projected data for MY 1993 are listed in Tables II&hyph;1 and II&hyph;2.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overall fleet fuel economy for passenger cars was 28.3 mpg in MY 1993. For MY 1993, CAFE values increased over MY 1992
levels for 15 of 21 passenger car manufacturers' fleets. (See Table II&hyph;1.) These 15 companies accounted for
over 74 percent of the total MY 1993 production. Manufacturers continued to introduce new technologies, more fuel
efficient models, and less fuel-efficient larger models. For MY 1993, the overall domestic manufacturers' fleet
average fuel economy was the highest it has ever been with 27.7 mpg, exceeding the CAFE standard by 0.2 mpg. The overall
domestic manufacturers' fleet average fuel economy is the closest it has been to that of the import manufacturers,
differing by only 1.8 mpg. For MY 1993, Ford and GM raised their domestic passenger car CAFE 0.7 and 0.6 mpg, respectively,
from their 1992 levels, while Chrysler fell 0.3 mpg below its MY 1992 level.

In MY 1993, the fleet average fuel economy for imported passenger cars increased by 0.5 mpg from the MY 1992 CAFE level.
Import CAFE was 29.5 mpg in MY 1993. Thirteen of the 18 imported car manufacturers increased their CAFE values between
MYs 1992 and 1993, including 6 of the 9 Asian importers. Figure II-1 illustrates the changes in total new passenger
car fleet CAFE from MY 1978 to MY 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total light truck fleet CAFE remained constant at the MY 1992 CAFE level of 20.8 mpg. Figure II-2 illustrates the
progress in total fleet CAFE from MY 1979 to MY 1993 for light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of passenger car and a few light truck manufacturers are projected not to achieve the levels of the MY 1993 CAFE
standards. NHTSA is not yet able to determine which of these manufacturers may be liable for civil penalties for noncompliance.
Some MY 1993 CAFE values may change when final figures are provided to NHTSA by EPA, in mid-1994. In addition, several
manufacturers are not expected to pay civil penalties because the credits they earned by exceeding the fuel economy
standards in earlier years offset later shortfalls. Other manufacturers may file carryback plans to demonstrate
that they anticipate earning credits in future model years to offset current deficits.

Daihatsu terminated sales of its passenger cars and light trucks in the United States after MY 1992, the first major
Asian manufacturer to do so. This manufacturer accumulated substantial CAFE credits during its 5-year marketing
span in the United States, but the sales of this company's products reached such a low level that it apparently decided
it was economically infeasible to remain.

While one Asian manufacturer exited the United States market, another, Kia Motors, entered. Kia, a South Korean manufacturer,
produces the Sephia sedan. It planned to test market a few thousand in MY 1993, with sales slated for October 1993 at
50 dealerships. Kia Motors also builds the Festiva model for Ford.

Mazda reported a domestic passenger car fleet consisting of its 626 and MX6 model vehicles which are built in Flatrock,
Michigan. These domestic-built vehicles do not appreciably affect the domestic fleet CAFE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The characteristics of the MY 1993 passenger car fleet reflect a continuing trend toward increased consumer demand
for higher performance cars. (See Table II&hyph;3.) Compared to MY 1992, the average curb weight for MY 1993 decreased
62 pounds for the domestic fleet and decreased 14 pounds for the imported fleet. The total new car fleet is 36 pounds
lighter than it was in MY 1992, primarily because of the larger share held by the domestic fleet. From MY 1992 to MY 1993,
horsepower per/100 pounds, a measure of vehicle performance, increased from 4.48 to 4.56 for domestic passenger
cars and from 4.66 to 4.72 for imported passenger cars. The total fleet average for passenger cars increased from 4.56
in MY 1992 to 4.62 horsepower/100 pounds in MY 1993, the highest level in the 38 years for which the agency has data. Average
engine displacement decreased from 192 to 184 cubic inches for domestic passenger cars and 139 to 136 cubic inches
for imported passenger cars.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The size class breakdown shows an increased trend towards compact and midsize passenger cars and a decrease in subcompact
and large passenger cars for the overall fleet. The domestic fleet shift is almost exclusively from subcompact and
large passenger cars to compact and midsize passenger cars. The shift of imported cars to both the midsize and compact
sizes is particularly pronounced. The imported share of the passenger car market declined slightly in MY 1993, but
imported compact cars increased to 36.6 percent of the imported fleet in MY 1993 from just 32.0 percent in MY 1992 and
now make up nearly 15 percent of the total new passenger car fleet.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 0.6 mpg fuel economy improvement for the MY 1993 domestic passenger car fleet may be attributed to mix shifts and
technology changes in the following: significant changes in engine design, decrease in average curb weight, and
automatic transmissions with lockup torque converters and four forward speeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 0.5 mpg increase average fuel economy for the MY 1993 imported passenger car fleet may be attributed to the same
reasons as the domestic fleet improvements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The domestic fleet had a dramatic decrease in share of turbocharged and supercharged engines. Diesel engines declined
in share after a small increase in MY 1992. Diesel engines were offered only on certain Mercedes Benz models during
MY 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Passenger car fleet average characteristics have changed significantly since the first year, MY 1978, of fuel economy
standards. After substantial initial weight loss from MY 1978 to MY 1982, the average passenger car fleet curb weight
decreased from 3,349 to 2,808 pounds; the passenger car fleet average curb weight stabilized at 2,800 to 3,000 pounds.
Table II&hyph;4 shows that the MY 1993 passenger car fleet has nearly equal interior volume, higher performance,
but over 40 percent fuel economy improvement compared to the MY 1978 fleet (see Figure II&hyph;3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The passenger car fleet in MY 1993 averaged the highest horsepower-to-weight ratio recorded since 1955, the earliest
year for which NHTSA has data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The characteristics of the MY 1993 light truck fleet are shown in Table II&hyph;5. Since light truck manufacturers
are not required to divide their fleets into domestic and import fleets based on the 75 percent domestic content threshold
used for passenger car fleets (except for United States-based manufacturers with captive import fleets), the domestic
and imported fleet characteristics in Table II&hyph;5 are estimated. NHTSA assumed foreign-based manufacturer's
products would not meet the domestic content threshold, whether they were assembled in the United States, Canada,
or another country. The exception is the assumption that the import-badged products of a domestic manufacturer's
assembled plant were ``domestic'' (Mazda Navajo and Nissan Quest).

The average test weight of the total light truck fleet increased by 32 pounds over that for MY 1992. The stability of
the 20.8 mpg CAFE level between MYs 1992 and 1993 may be attributed to the small increase in shares of compact vans and
special purpose vehicles and the small increase in the use of lockup converter clutches and four forward speed automatic
transmissions, offsetting the increased popularity of large pickups and heavier trucks. Diesel engine usage declined
in light trucks to 0.07 percent in MY 1993 from 0.09 percent in MY 1992. The imported share of the MY 1993 light truck fleet
decreased to 14.9 percent, 2.4 percent lower than MY 1992 and the lowest share since light truck fuel economy standards
were established.

increased, beginning at 18.5 mpg in MY 1980 and reaching 21.7 mpg in MY 1987 before dropping to lower values in MY 1988
through MY 1993, as average weight, engine size, and performance increased. During these years, light truck production
increased from 1.9 million in MY 1980 to 4.6 million in MY 1993. Light trucks comprised nearly a third of the total light
duty vehicle fleet production in MY 1993, almost double its share in MY 1980.

Figure II&hyph;4 illustrates that the light duty fleet (passenger cars and light trucks together) average fuel economy
steadily increased in MY 1987, but subsequently has been below the MY 1987 level (see Table II&hyph;6). Light truck
average fuel economy also declined, but the passenger car average fuel economy remained relatively constant for
MYs 1987&hyph;1993. The overall decline illustrates the emergence of light trucks in the light duty fleet.

While the passenger car fleet fuel economy improved by 0.4 mpg from MY 1992 to MY 1993 and the light truck fleet was unchanged,
the total fleet fuel economy for MY 1993 increased only 0.1 mpg over the MY 1992 level (25.0 mpg for MY 1992 and 25.1 mpg
for MY 1993). This is attributed to increased sales of light trucks which have a total fleet fuel economy far less than
passenger cars. The shift to light trucks for general transportation is an important trend in consumers' preference
and has a significant fleet fuel consumption effect.

Domestic and imported passenger car fleet average fuel economies improved since MY 1978. In MY 1993, the domestic
and imported passenger car fleet average fuel economies increased to 27.7 mpg and 29.5 mpg, respectively. This reflects
an increase of 9.0 mpg since MY 1978 for domestic cars. For imported cars, the MY 1993 average fuel economy is only 2.2
mpg higher than that of MY 1978.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Domestic and imported light truck fleet average fuel economies improved since MY 1980. The domestic manufacturers
continued to dominate the light truck market. Domestic light trucks comprised 85.1 percent of the total light truck
fleet. For MY 1993, the domestic light truck fleet has an average fuel economy of 2.3 mpg lower than the imported light
truck fleet. The imported light truck fleet fuel economy improved rapidly between MYs 1980 and 1981, but has been lower
since then. For MY 1993, the imported light truck fleet fuel economy increased 0.3 mpg over MY 1992 to 22.8 mpg. A comparison
of MYs 1993 to 1980 was done to avoid comparing the performance of the 0-6,000 pounds GVWR light truck fleet covered
by the MY 1979 fuel economy standard to the performance of the 0&hyph;8,500 pounds GVWR fleets to which the standards
apply for MY 1980 and beyond.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The gap between the average CAFEs of the imported and domestic manufacturers is smaller than in earlier years as domestic
manufacturers maintain relatively stable CAFE values while the import manufacturers move to larger, higher performance
vehicles and more four-wheel drive light trucks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a comparative analysis, since the enactment of CAFE standards for passenger cars for MY 1978, the total annual
fleet fuel consumption, for both passenger cars and light trucks, has grown from 105.7 billion gallons (81.7 billion
gallons for passenger cars + 24.1 billion gallons for 2-axle, 4-tire light trucks) in 1978 (Highway Statistics Summary
to 1985, Table VM&hyph;201A) to 107 billion gallons (73.9 billion gallons for passenger cars + 33.1 billion gallons
for light trucks) in 1992, the most current data (Highway Statistics Summary to 1992, Table VM&hyph;1). Over a 14-year
period, total fuel consumption increased only 1.2 percent. Improvements in fuel economy have offset growth in the
total number of light duty vehicles and in miles traveled per vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both vehicle registrations and vehicle miles traveled increased from 1978 to 1992. The total fleet registration
increased 27.7 percent from 143,904,787 (118,428,730 for passenger cars + 25,476,057 for light trucks) in 1978 to
183,746,571 (144,213,429 for passenger cars + 39,533,142 for light trucks) in MY 1992. Vehicle miles traveled increased
during this period. In 1978, vehicle miles traveled totaled 1.426 trillion (1.147 for passenger cars + 0.279 for light
trucks). It increased to 2.072 trillion for the total fleet (1.595 for passenger cars + 0.477 for light trucks) in 1992.
This is an increase of over 45.3 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, although more vehicles are traveling more miles, fuel consumption by this total fleet (both passenger
cars and light trucks) has increased only slightly.

This case challenged NHTSA's May 1989 decision to terminate rulemaking on whether to amend the MY 1990 passenger car
CAFE standard. On February 19, 1992, in a 2&hyph;1 decision, the D.C. Circuit Court held that NHTSA failed to adequately
evaluate the safety consequences of its decision to retain the MY 1990 passenger car CAFE standard of 27.5 mpg rather
than proceeding with proposed rulemaking to reduce that model year's standard. The Court remanded the matter to NHTSA
for further consideration. CEI filed a Motion for Attorney Fees which NHTSA opposed. On August 6, 1992, the Court issued
an order deferring decision on CEI's fee motion until NHTSA acts on the Court's remand order. NHTSA's subsequent action
on this remand order is discussed below.

This case challenges NHTSA's January 15, 1993, decision (D.C. Circuit Court's remand in Case No. 89&hyph;1422) to
again terminate the rulemaking it commenced to consider amending the MY 1990 passenger car CAFE standard. The petition
for review was filed on March 15, 1993. Both sides filed preliminary papers, but the Court has not yet issued a briefing
and argument schedule.

B. Light Truck CAFE Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA published a final rule establishing the MY 1995 light truck fuel economy standard on April 7, 1993 (58 FR 18019).
NHTSA set a combined standard of 20.6 mpg for MY 1995, the highest CAFE standard the agency has ever established for
light trucks. The rule also converted certain measurements into metric units, the agency's first occurrence of using
metric conversion for regulations relating to fuel economy standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule for MY 1995 light trucks, NHTSA determined that GM is the ``least capable'' manufacturer with a combined
fuel economy capability of 20.6 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA concluded upon balancing the relevant statutory factors, that the relatively small and uncertain energy savings
that would be associated with setting a standard above GM's capability would not justify the economic harm to the company
and the economy as a whole. NHTSA projected that GM could not achieve a combined fuel economy level higher than 20.6
mpg for MY 1995. In contrast, NHTSA concluded that Chrysler and Ford can achieve CAFE levels of at least 20.6 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA selected 20.6 mpg for MY 1995 as the final combined standard to balance the potentially serious adverse economic
consequences associated with the realization of the above market and technological risks against GM's opportunity
as the ``least capable'' manufacturer with a substantial share of sales. Since GM produces more than 38 percent of
all light trucks that are subject to the fuel economy standards, its capability significantly affects the level of
the industry's capability and, therefore, the standard level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final rule for light truck fuel economy standards for MYs 1996 and 1997 is pending.

C. Low Volume Petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 502(c) of the Act provides that a low volume manufacturer of passenger cars may be exempted from the generally
applicable passenger car fuel economy standards if these standards are more stringent than the maximum feasible
average fuel economy for that manufacturer and if NHTSA establishes an alternative standard for that manufacturer
at its maximum feasible level. Under the Act, a low volume manufacturer is one that manufactured fewer than 10,000
passenger cars worldwide, in the model year for which the exemption is sought (the affected model year) and in the second
model year preceding that model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During 1993, NHTSA acted on one low volume petition that was filed by Rolls-Royce. Rolls-Royce requested an alternative
standard for its passenger cars for MYs 1995 and 1996. NHTSA issued a proposed decision to grant an alternative standard
of 14.6 mpg for both model years (58 FR 41228 August 3, 1993).

Section 508(b)(1) of the Act imposes a civil penalty of $5 dollars for each tenth of a mpg by which a manufacturer's CAFE
level falls short of the standard, multiplied by the total number of passenger automobiles or light trucks produced
by the manufacturer in that model year. Credits that were earned for exceeding the standard in any of the three model
years immediately prior to or subsequent to the model years in question can be used to offset the penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With EPA completion of final CAFE computations for MY 1992 for most passenger car fleets, NHTSA initiated enforcement
actions for manufacturers that did not meet the CAFE standard.

On January 8, 1992, an Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision and order recommending that NHTSA's complaint
seeking a civil penalty of $1,371,420 for Chrysler's failure to comply with the MY 1984 domestic light truck fuel economy
standard be dismissed without prejudice. He concluded that NHTSA could not interpret the extent to which predecessors
or successors are included in the term ``manufacturer'' without issuing rules pursuant to section 501(8) of the Motor
Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972, but that Chrysler could not claim credits earned by American Motor
Corporation, except under the terms of a properly adopted rule. Both parties filed Notices of Intention to appeal
the initial decision to NHTSA's Administrator. On March 31, 1992, after a meeting to consider settlement proposals,
the Administrator set aside the initial decision and terminated the enforcement proceeding, without prejudice,
to permit NHTSA to prescribe regulations pursuant to section 501(8) of the Act.

manufacturers introduced and replaced several cars, as well as updated several previous passenger cars. Chrysler
unveiled its new midsize LH models_the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid, and Eagle Vision. These models are built
on the new front-drive LH platform, the company's first new platform in 10 years. The main features included advanced
technology, roomy interior, ride comfort, handling precision, safety, fuel economy, and power. The LH models' longitudinally
mounted engines include a 153 horsepower (hp) overhead-valve (OHV) 3.3 liter (1) V&hyph;6 and a 214 hp single-overhead-cam
(SOHC) 3.5L 24-valve V&hyph;6 (standard on some models, optional on others) developed especially for the LH line.
Both engines are mated to only one transaxle: the 42LE automatic, a fully adaptive electronically controlled four-speed
with torque converter lockup clutch. The low drag coefficient (0.31 C
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of these models contributed to their fuel efficiency which averaged 24 mpg for MY 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also new to the Chrysler Eagle Talon, is a smaller 1.8L I&hyph;4 engine offered with either 5-speed manual or 4-speed
automatic transmission and delivering an average fuel economy of 27 mpg.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Plymouth Division offered a redesigned Colt coupe and sedan and Vista wagon with a new 1.8L 16 valve SOHC engine
that produces 113 hp and a 2.4L 16 valve SOHC engine on the Vista only that produces 136 hp. The average fuel economy on
the Colt's 1.5L 4-cylinder engine with a 5-speed manual transmission increased by 3 mpg city and 5 mpg highway over
its MY 1992 counterpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford has two new models_the Lincoln Mark VIII sport luxury coupe and the Mercury Villager minivan (the latter is discussed
later with the light trucks). The Mark VIII features an aerodynamic design style powered by a new aluminum double-overhead-cam
(DOHC) V&hyph;8 engine and a new Ford ``4R70W'' 4-speed automatic transmission. The ``4R70W'' stands for 4-speed,
rear-drive, 700 pound-feet torque capacity and wide ratio. The transmission's electronic and hydraulic controls
work together to provide smooth shifts and torque-converter lock-up in third and fourth gear. This reduces the converter
slippage and improves the fuel economy. The average fuel economy on this model is nearly 24 mpg compared with 22.3 mpg
for the predecessor Mark VII model.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford redesigned the 2-door Probe for MY 1993 based on Mazda's latest MX&hyph;6. The Probe has a cab forward design and
is powered by multivalve engines. The base model is equipped with a 115 hp 2L, 4-cylinder engine and the GT is powered
by a 165 hp 2.5L V&hyph;6 engine. The average fuel economy on the 5-speed manual transmission has improved by 2 mpg over
the MY 1992 model.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limited-edition Ford Mustang Cobra specialty model featured a 230 hp version of the Mustang's 5L V&hyph;8 engine,
a 5-speed manual transmission, 17-inch aluminum wheels, a spoiler, and ground effects trim. The average fuel economy
improved by 1 mpg on the 4-speed automatic transmission version over the MY 1992 counterpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Motors (GM) redesigned the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird. These two sport coupes received smoother
lines and a more gradual profile. The base engine for these models is a new 3.4L V&hyph;6 engine. Fuel economy improves
by 1 mpg over the 1992 model.

multiport-fuel-injection (MFI) 4-cylinder engine. The engine has 14 percent more horsepower and torque than the
engine it replaced. The average fuel economy improved by 1 mpg for the 5-speed manual transmission and 0.5 mpg for the
4-speed automatic transmission over its MY 1992 counterpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jaguar, a Ford subsidiary, introduced two new models_the XJR-S and XJ12. The XJR-S is a limited edition equipped with
a 312 hp engine. The MY 1993 XJS Jaguar coupe/convertible uses a 6-cylinder engine instead of a V-12, for the first time
in 22 years. The highway rating for the convertible is 23 mpg, compared with 17 mpg for MY 1992. The XJ12 is a 301 hp model
based on the XJ6 sedan with the engine compartment modified to fit a 6.0L 24-value V-12 engine. It has a 4-speed automatic
transmission with both sport and normal shift modes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mercedes-Benz added a soft top, 4-seat convertible_the 300CE Cabriolet_and replaced the 400SE with a long-wheelbase
version, the 400SEL. Mercedes introduced 22 new models for MY 1993, the most ever for the company, with emphasis on
the 300 class, the Mercedes volume leader.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four 300-class models get a new 24-valve engine that is bigger and more powerful than the old engine, yet gets better
mileage. Better mileage means that the 400E loses a $1,300 gas guzzler penalty and the penalty on the 500E is cut in half
to $1,300. both are powered by V-8 engines. The 300CE Cabriolet is based on the 300CE coupe and it is the first Mercedes
4-seat convertible for United States sale since 1971. The Cabriolet comes equipped with a 217 hp 3.2L 24 valve DOHC

Some manufacturers made significant improvements in engine technology for MY 1993. Chrysler's Dodge Intrepid,
Chrysler Concorde, and Eagle Vision offer a 3.5L, 24-valve V&hyph;6 engine combined with a new 42LE electronic 4-speed
transaxle to propel the LH cars. Chrysler claims that these are the most technologically advanced, responsive, and
reliable powertrains in its history. This SOHC engine delivers a peak 214 hp at 5,800 revolutions per minute (rpm)
and 221 foot-pounds (ft.-lbs.) of torque at 2,800 rpm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead of using the usual transverse position of front-wheel-drive engines, Chrysler went longitudinal, or north-south,
in part to allow for later adaptation of future rear-to or 4-wheel-drive versions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford improved its MY 1993 Mark VIII with a new DOHC 32-valve all-aluminum version of its 4.6L modular V&hyph;8 engine.
The engine is rated at 280 hp at 5,500 rpm, with a torque rating of 285 ft.&hyph;lbs. at 4,500 rpm, about 33 percent more
power than the 4.6L SOHC engine in its 210 hp dual exhaust form. The new engine is the first DOHC, 4-valve V&hyph;8 engine
mass produced by Ford, and the first Ford all-aluminum V&hyph;8 production engine. The engine features improved
durability, quality and reliability, improved fuel efficiency through reduced friction and optimized combustion
chamber design, and use of advanced technology in design and manufacturing.

GM's powerful, 2-door sporty coupes, the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, were redesigned for MY 1993 with
an OHV 3.4L 6-cylinder engine, that develops 160 hp at 4,600 rpm and 200 ft.-lbs. of torque at 3,600 rpm, an increase
of 20 in both hp and ft.-lbs. of torque compared to last year. The added power is the result of a 2 millimeter (mm) increase
in bore to 91.9 mm, a rise in compression ratio to 9:1 from 8.5:1 and the addition of sequential fuel injection in place
of multipoint fuel injection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM's Chevrolet and GMC truck divisions have a new electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission in full-sized
pickups. The new 4L 60&hyph;E transmission replaces the nonelectronic 4-speed unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Geo Prizm has a Toyota-built electronically controlled 4-speed automatic with lockup torque converter. The
new transmission is coupled to a 1.8L DOHC 4-cylinder engine delivering 115 hp at 5,600 rpm and 115 ft.-lbs. of torque
at 4,800 rpm.

Honda's Acura Legend introduced a new 3.2L 24-valve V&hyph;6 engine. The difference in this engine over its predecessor
is that the intake and exhaust timing, valve lift, and valve diameter are changed to achieve a 30-hp increase to 230
hp at 6,200 rpm, but with peak torque reduced to 206 ft.-lbs. at 5,000 rpm. Fuel economy is virtually unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota's Land Cruiser received a new 4.5L DOHC 24-valve 1FZ&hyph;FE in-line 6-cylinder engine rated at 212 hp at 4,600
rpm and 275 ft.-lbs. of torque at 3,200 rpm. This is a 37 percent increase in horsepower over its MY 1992 counterpart,
and the fuel economy improved by 0.5 mpg.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Miller Cycle engine offers a 50-percent gain in torque over conventional engines and gets 10 percent to 15 percent
better fuel economy. Mazda announced that it is ready to install a version of the Miller-cycle engine in a near-future
high-compression, lean-system piston engine that combines lean burn and the M-Miller cycle. (The M denotes Mazda.)
Mazda says the engine, which has a compression ratio of 12:1, will produce 50 percent greater torque than a standard
engine. The M-Miller cycle uses a Lysholm compressor jointly developed by Mazda and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries
Co. Ltd. (IHI) to boost initial intake pressure, but releases excess air as the piston begins its compression stroke.
Mazda plans to introduce this technology in the United States on the Millenia model in the spring of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interest in the 2-stroke engine is declining while interest in direct-injected (DI) gasoline 4-strokes is on the
rise. With DI engines, the fuel is injected directly into the combustion chamber rather than the intake manifold,
which is the general practice on fuel-injected gasoline engines. Reports of poor performance in early 2-stroke Ford
Motor Company/Orbital field-test Fiesta models in Europe (Ward's Engine and Vehicle Technology Update, December
15, 1991, p.6) appear to be a factor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota indicates that the first DI gasoline engines_termed ``incylinder injection'' by Toyota_will reach the market
in late 1993 and will account for over 25 percent of the Japanese manufacturer's gasoline automobile engines by the
year 2012. Hyundai developed the company's first internally designed engine, a 1.5L 4-cylinder engine delivering
92 hp at 5,500 rpm and 97 ft.-lbs. of torque at 4,000 rpm. The compression ratio is 10:1. Hyundai's turbocharged version
produces 115 hp at 5,500 rpm.

Applications of electronics components in vehicles continues to rise. Some of the applications include 4-wheel
steering, tire-pressure sensing, instrumentation, and in-car entertainment grouping, but the main concentration
is in engine management, powertrain managment, antilock braking systems, air bags, air conditioning and, increasingly,
suspension control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electronically controlled automatic transmissions now account for 33.9 percent of United States cars produced.
The automobile manufacturers have advanced toward more sophisticated fuel injection systems. Sequential fuel
injection installation rates rose to 43.3 percent in MY 1992, from 28.2 percent in MY 1991. Traction control systems
are featured on 2.3 percent of United States-built passenger cars (Ward's Automotive Reports, April 19, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The role of sensors and sensing systems is becoming increasingly important in the automotive industry. Since the
electronics market is growing in the safety and the information fields, the object of sensing will be expanding further
in the future. Sensors and sensing technologies for future automotive systems can be categorized into three fields
of applications_engine and powertrain control, safety and suspension control, and information exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In engine and powertrain systems, sensors are required for combustion and engine output detection and control. Exhaust
emissions and fuel consumption will be reduced simultaneously over the next decade. The primary objective of the
sensors is to control engine and transmission paramenters, but sensing technology improvements are needed to determine
limit conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Combustion sensing will be an essential technology for engine control. Emissions are strongly dependent on the air/fuel
(A/F) ratio, and the best fuel consumption is obtained when engine operation is in the lean burn fuel range. Except
for oxides of nitrogen reduction, the lean fuel condition is best for both emissions and fuel consumption reductions.
Since the engine's output and emissions are the results of combustion, direct monitoring of combustion is the key
for controlling them.

For MY 1993, manufacturers selected sheet molding compound (SMC), plastics, aluminum, high-strength steel, powdered
metal (P/M), and magnesium for a number of significant new component applications in their cars, vans, and pickup
trucks. The reduced weight of these components contributed to improved fuel economy of the models using them.

SMC was once predicted to be headed for extinction, but continues to have steady growth in usage despite numerous setbacks.
The SMC Automotive Alliance trade group forecasts an 18-percent gain in SMC use in MY 1993, from 147 million pounds
to 173 million pounds, on North American-produced vehicles (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

, September 1992). New SMC applications continue to grow, including roof, doors, and a rear hatch on GM's Pontiac Firebird
and Chevrolet Camaro sports cars, a unique plastic-and-steel-body hybrid. Ford's new Mark VIII hood is made of SMC
for MY 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aluminum use in automobiles grew steadily, representing an estimated average of 178 pounds of the content of United
States cars for MY 1993 (Ward's Auto World, September 1992). Most applications are in engine blocks and heads, transmission
casings, steering systems, shock absorbers, bumper systems, and other non-structural components. Aluminum is
used more not only for body panels but for structural components, as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Audi engineers say the body-in-white of the next generation V8 model (codenamed 300), which will feature an all-aluminum
body and spaceframe, is half the weight of a conventional steel unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the first time, an aluminum-head version of GM's 5.7L V&hyph;8 engine is used on vehicles other than the Corvette.
The new F-body cars use castings from CMI International, Incorporated in Southfield, Michigan, to help reduce weight.
Aluminum heads also are offered for the first time in the Oldsmobile Ciera and Buick Century 2.2L. The aluminum 2.2L
I&hyph;4 engine replaces the 2.5L 4-cylinder cast iron engine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford is by far the most aggressive United States manufacturer in its plans for aluminum usage, especially in body-panel
applications. It uses about 350,000 aluminum hoods per year on large cars such as the Mercury Grand Marquis, Ford Crown
Victoria, and Lincoln Town Car.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cylinder heads for Chrysler's new 24-valve, 3.5L V&hyph;6 engine are also aluminum. These applications are currently
being used in LH cars_Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker, and LHS_which use about 200 pounds
of aluminum, compared with an industry average of less than 180 pounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even as the use of plastics grew, steel continued as the primary material in United States-built family vehicles,
comprising well over 50 percent of the weight of the average passenger car according to Ward's 1993 Automotive Yearbook.
GM's Cadillac Division has a new steel-intensive Fleetwood, and Fleetwood Broughams use stainless steel on the lower
side trim and plated stainless steel trim on all the wheel openings. The Nissan Altima and the Chrysler LH cars, each,
use more than 1,500 pounds of steel per car (Ward's Auto World, September 1992). Steel increases to 1,900 pounds per
vehicle for the new Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest minivans. Chrysler uses almost as much steel on its new Jeep Grand
Cherokee wagon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications for P/M grew steadily in recent years, and several new and expanded applications were introduced in
MY 1993, including the connecting rods used in GM's 5.7L V&hyph;8 engines. This marks the first time GM used P/M connecting
rods in any of its North American powerplants. The new rods add 12 pounds of P/M per engine. The average United States-built
car contains about 25 pounds of P/M. Ford currently is the industry leader in P/M applications; it has P/M connecting
rods in two of its engines, a V&hyph;8 and the 1.9L 4-cylinder (Ward's Automotive Yearbook, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Magnesium use increased this model year when Chrysler added magnesium engine-accessory mounting brackets on its
Jeep Grand Cherokee and LH cars. Ford, meanwhile, is expanding its use of magnesium steering-column parts, and GM
is employing 18 pounds of magnesium components in its Northstar V&hyph;8 engines The average domestic vehicle contains
about 6 pounds of magnesium (Ward's Auto World, September 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States manufacturers formed a research partnership, under the United States Council for Automotive Research
(USCAR) direction, that will explore the use of new materials. The consortium, called the United States Automobile
Materials Partnership (USAMP), will seek to reduce vehicle mass for improved fuel economy, emissions, reliability,
safety, crashworthiness, and recyclability by expanding application of new materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USAMP states that to improve fuel economy 8&hyph;10 mpg through mass reduction in a 4,000-pound car, weight will have
to be cut 1,000 pounds. USAMP targeted aluminum as the primary metal in its program to reduce vehicle mass though ceramics,
engineered plastics, magnesium/titanium, and steel are also being studied.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the stabilization of oil prices and supply, consumer demand in MY 1993 shifted slightly to more powerful and
roomier passenger cars and light trucks. The auto industry, responding to this shift, increased the horsepower of
its engines and shifted production mix to moderately larger cars. There were some considerable technical gains,
particularly in lightweight material usage, that contributed to improved fuel economy for several models.

Background/Objectives of This Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within the past two years, political and social evolution in the Middle East has produced democratic elections in
Jordan and Yemen, the re-emergence of civil government in Lebanon, an agreement intended to bring about Palestinian
self government and the responsibility for providing and administering social services that entails in Gaza and
the West Bank, and the gradual emergence, in a number of heretofore closed political systems, of more responsive and
accessible governmental institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Essential to the success and fruition of these political experiments is the development, in each society affected,
of responsible and responsive administration in public institutions and the perception, often absent in developing
societies, of a public office as a public trust. The primary objective of this program is, initially, to instill in
a group of public administrators, with responsibility for a variety of civil administrative and management functions,
a sense of civil administration as a crucial element in the emergence of a viable civil culture, and secondly, to broaden
and refine their ability to fulfill their duties and to contribute to the development of a cadre of enlightened, self-conscious,
and responsible public administrators in their home countries.

Participants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants for the U.S. component of this exchange will include mid-level public administrators from various
sectors health, education, housing, security, and general social welfare_from Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, whose
English-language skills are sufficient to enable them to function successfully during the U.S. internship phase
of the program. Participants will be nominated through coordination among USIA, U.S. Information Service personnel
in the region, and overseas partner institutions. USIA and the participating USIS posts retain the right to nominate
all participants and to accept or reject participants recommended by grantee institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American participants in the program, both those institutions which will host foreign public administrators in
the United States and those individuals who will subsequently travel overseas as resource persons in the second component
of the exchange, will be selected by the American grantee organization in consultation with the Office of Citizen
Exchanges. The consultants travelling overseas should be fluent in the language of the country in which the seminar
is presented or the American grantee organization should undertake to provide simultaneous interpretation.

Programmatic Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thematically, the program should: Analyze the current status of public administration in the participants' countries
of origin and determine, in conjunction with USIS posts in these countries and with the administrators selected as
participants, the needs to be addressed by the exchange; provide the participants both a general and a specific overview
of the administration and management of public service-providing organizations in the United States, beginning
with an historic perspective and a survey of the evolution of the civil service system in the context of a socially diverse
and politically democratic country; conduct for the participants a short, intensive course, combining lectures
with discussion, site visits, and interviews, in public administration theory and practice. This course should
also offer an intensive orientation to the concept of public service as an indispensable building block in the structure
of democratic society and to the perception of a public office as a public trust; and place the administrators in month-long
internships appropriate to their fields of specialization and responsibility in their home countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the legislation authorizing the Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs, programs must maintain a nonpolitical
character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural
life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beyond the immediate goals of this exchange, USIA is also interested in supporting programs which will lay the groundwork
for new and continuing links between American and Middle Eastern educational institutions and professional organizations
and which will encourage the further growth and development of democratic institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grantee organization will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include
organizing a coherent progression of activities, providing international and domestic travel arrangements for
all participants, making lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors, orienting and debriefing
participants, preparing any necessary support material, and working with host institutions and individuals to
achieve maximum program effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prepare foreign public administrators for this project prior to their arrival in the United States, E/P encourages
the grantee organization to develop material to be sent to USIS offices overseas for distribution to participants.
This material might include a tentative project outline with suggested goals and objectives, relevant background
information, and information about American institutions and individuals involved in the exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the beginning of the U.S. portion of the program, the grantee should conduct an orientation session for the visiting
participants which addresses administrative details of the program and provides general information about American
society and culture which will facilitate the participants' understanding of and adjustment to daily life in the
United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the conclusion of the program, the group should meet in a symposium to review what has been presented to and experienced
by the participants and to consider how that which has been learned can most effectively be applied upon the participants'
return to their home countries. Plans for the second component of the exchange should also be discussed at this time,
and nominations should be accepted from the participants of American specialists who will be invited to conduct follow-up
activities overseas.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Per Diem support from host institutions during an internship component is strongly encouraged. However, for all
programs which include internships, a nonprofit grantee institution which receives funds from corporate or other
cosponsors should then use those monies to provide food, lodging, and pocket money for the participants. In no case
could the intern receive a wage or ``be hired'' by the sponsoring institution. Internships should also have an American
Studies/values orientation component at the beginning of the exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. grantee institution should try to maximize cost-sharing in all facets of their program and to stimulate U.S.
private sector (foundation and corporate) support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals incorporating internships will be more competitive if letters committing prospective host institutions
to supporting these efforts are provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Competition for USIA funding support is keen. The final selection of a grantee institution will depend on assessment
of proposals according to the review criteria delineated below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount requested from USIA for this program should not exceed $180,000. However, organizations with less than
four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they are also encouraged to include separate
sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location or activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: (1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular
No. A&hyph;133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions; (2) complies with
the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No.
92&hyph;9; and (3) includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental
schedule of indirect cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The audit costs shall be identified separately for: (1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting
services; and (2) preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133,
AICPA SOP 92&hyph;9, and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA will consider funding the following project costs: 1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit
costs (e.g., airport taxes); ground transportation costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Per diem:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for international participants or the
published Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates for individual American cities. Note: U.S. escorting staff
must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities in the Middle East, the Standard Government
Travel Regulations per diem rates must be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Book and cultural allowance:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus a book allowance of $50. Escorts
are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4. Consultants:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Honoraria should not exceed $250 per day. Subcontracting
organizations may also be used, in which case the written contract(s) must be included in the proposal.

9. Other costs necessary for the effective administration of the program, including salaries for grant organization
employees, benefits, and other direct and indirect costs per detailed instructions in the application package.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E/P encourages cost-sharing, which may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient must maintain
written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing
and Matching,'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not meet the minimum amount
of cost-sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion
to the Recipient's contribution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The NIS Linkage Program is authorized under the Freedom Support Act of 1992. Funding for this program is contingent
upon receipt of FY 94 Foreign Operations Appropriation Bill funds. USIA administers annual university affiliations
programs under the authority of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, Public Law 87&hyph;256
(Fulbright-Hays Act). The Agency seeks to support at least one linkage each in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and
Kyrgyzstan, and up to three linkages in Ukraine. Grants will be awarded for a period of two (2) years beginning October
1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIS Linkage Program is separate from USIA's College and University Partnerships Program for the Russian Federation,
the University Affiliations Program and the University Development Program in Business Management, announced
annually in this publication. However, the Agency strives to achieve institutional and geographic diversity across
all four linkage programs. Institutions planning to submit proposals for more than one competition should note that
USIA will not fund the same project activities more than once.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIS Linkage Program is limited to the following specific academic disciplines: (1) Law; (2) business/economics;
(3) education/continuing education/educational reform; (4) government/public policy/public administration;
and (5) communications/journalism. Proposals should focus on curriculum, faculty, and staff development in one
of these eligible disciplines. Administrative reform at the foreign partner institution should also be a program
component.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals must involve the development of new academic programs or the building and/or restructuring of an existing
program. Feasibility studies to plan linkages will not be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participating institutions must exchange faculty and/or staff members for teaching/lecturing and consulting
for periods of not less than one month. Each year at least one U.S. participant should be in residence at the foreign
partner institution for one semester to serve in a coordinating role. E-mail communication should be established
as part of the exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other activities which serve the purpose of this program include: Team teaching; visits by faculty to update academic
and professional skills, observe teaching techniques and strengthen subject area expertise; expansion of library
holdings; textbook development; development of audio-visual instructional materials; distance learning; the
translation or reprinting of U.S. texts and other materials; and community outreach in conjunction with curriculum
development. Institutional partners may include current MA, MS or PhD students in the exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA will strive to achieve broad institutional and geographic diversity in awarding the grants. Participating
institutions in the U.S. and relevant countries must maintain their faculty and staff on salary and benefits (with
the sole exception of personnel assigned overseas for three or more consecutive months; see ``Allowable Costs'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. institutions are responsible for the submission of proposals and must collaborate with their foreign partners
in planning and preparing proposals. U.S. and foreign partner institutions are encouraged to consult about the proposed
project with U.S. Information Service (USIS) offices in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine.
Preference will be given to proposals which demonstrate evidence of previous relations with the proposed foreign
partner institution(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 20 hours per response, including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,
including suggestions for reducing this administrative burden, to USIA Clearance Officer, M/ADD, room 624, U.S.
Information Agency, 301 4th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20547; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Washington, DC 20503. (Information collection involved in this program has
been cleared by OMB Approval Number 3116&hyph;0179, expiration date 12/31/95.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life.

Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Authority for this activity is the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, Public Law 87&hyph;256 Fulbright-Hays
Act. Through the Fulbright program USIA seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States

character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural
life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Support is offered for two categories. Organizations may address one or both categories, but must submit a separate
proposal for each category. Special emphasis will be given to social sciences and humanities.

In preparing a proposal, organizations should address the subjects of program design and scheduling, as well as program
administration. At a minimum, a successful proposal should clearly cover publicity, selection process, orientation
for participants, logistical and scheduling measures. A basic plan for post-program follow-up and evaluation should
also be included. The proposal must be typewritten and double-spaced and cannot exceed fifteen pages, including
budget attachments.

Organizations should demonstrate substantial cost-sharing (dollar and in-kind support) in both program and administrative
expenses, including overseas partner contributions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA reserves the right to reduce, revise or increase budget proposals in accordance with the needs of the program.
No grants funded under this program will include profit or fee. Please note: It is required that requested administrative
funds, including indirect costs and administrative expenses for recruitment and orientation, not exceed 20 percent
of the total amount requested from USIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost-sharing is encouraged. Cost-sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient
must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as cost to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A110, Attachment E. Cost-sharing
and matching should be described in the proposal. In the event the recipient does not provide the minimum amount of
cost-sharing as stipulated in the recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion to
the recipient's contribution. The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of the audit that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(3) Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of the recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of
indirect cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The audit costs shall be identified separately for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the auspices of the SEED Act, USIA is offering this program to help foster greater expertise in business management
in selected countries of the region. The specific purpose of this program is to assist Central and East European Countries
in their transformation to free market economies through the development of business management training capabilities
in academic institutions. Proposals that are extensions or enhancements of past or current relationships with a
partner institution will be accepted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions: In the U.S., participation in the program is open to accredited two-year and four-year colleges and
universities, including graduate schools. Consortia of universities and/or community colleges, individually
or as systems, are also eligible. U.S. colleges and universities or consortia applying under this program may collaborate
with U.S. scholarly, professional, or international educational associations and organizations. Proposals from
a consortium may be submitted by a single member institution with authority to represent the consortium. Overseas,
participation is limited to recognized degree-granting institutions of higher education and internationally
recognized and highly regarded independent research institutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special Note: The Agency encourages proposals from eligible Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)
and other institutions in the U.S. with significant minority student enrollment. Consortia of colleges/universities
including such institutions are also strongly encouraged to apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutional Representatives: Each participant representing a U.S. institution, whose travel costs are covered
under UDPBM funding, must be a U.S. citizen. Each participant representing a foreign institution must be a citizen,
national, or permanent resident of the eligible foreign country in which the foreign partner institution is located.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant activities must include placement of U.S. faculty at Central and East European institutions for in-country
training of foreign faculty and for development of sustainable programs to educate future foreign business management
teachers and business people. An important goal of the program is to create enduring linkages between the designated
foreign institutions and U.S. colleges and universities. Targeted program activities may include: Faculty development
and enrichment; curriculum design; modernization of the administrative structures within the foreign institution;
outreach to the private sector; and direct teaching. U.S. and foreign participants may include post-graduate students
on a ``faculty track'' who are currently involved in teaching at participating institutions (not to exceed 25% of
all participants). Components for the development of college/university-to-private sector linkages and the development
of appropriate materials are encouraged. Orientation, seminar, workshop and semester-long course formats will
be acceptable. Visits to partner institutions by staff or consultants to plan joint projects may be funded under this
grant but should be a relatively small part of the overall exchange. Preference will be given to proposals in which
a U.S. faculty member is placed at the foreign partner institution for at least one academic year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Courses developed may include, but are not limited to: Marketing, production management, economics, industrial
relations, finance, accounting, and international business and business communications. Proposals should provide
for a two-way exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exchange activities should include establishment of electronic communications between partner institutions
and other networks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In making award decisions, USIA will focus especially on evidence of an ongoing commitment by the U.S. partner to internationalizing
its educational programs as well as a commitment by both partner institutions to the success of the particular exchange
program. Each proposal must include documentation of institutional support for the proposed program in the form
of signed letters of endorsement from the president, chancellor, or director of the U.S. and foreign institution(s)
involved. The documentation may also be submitted in the form of a signed agreement by the same persons. Each agreement
or letter of endorsement must describe the institution's commitment to an on-going partnership and make specific
reference to the proposed program and how it will fit into and be supported by the institution's current activities
in internationalizing its educational programs. Proposals must comment on how the partnership might be continued
beyond the period of the grant award. If not submitted with original proposal, documentation of support from foreign
institutions must be received by 5 p.m. Washington, DC time on May 13, 1994, addressed to Robin Kline or Deborah Trent,
E/ASU, room 349, U.S. Information Agency, 301 4th Street SW., Washington, DC 20547. Applicant institutions are expected
to make their own arrangements with the appropriate foreign institutions regarding institutional commitment and
visas. All programs and foreign participants must be in compliance with J&hyph;1 visa regulations and the proposal
must make reference to this requirement.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Trade Representative (``USTR'') has made a positive determination pursuant to section 304(a)(1)(A)(ii).
Since the Government of Brazil has undertaken measures to significantly improve the protection and enforcement
of intellectual property rights and market access for persons relying on intellectual property rights and will take
additional steps in the future in connection with its intention to implement the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral
trade negotiations including the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Rights, the USTR has decided
to terminate this investigation and monitor implementation of these measures under section 306(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the USTR has decided to revoke the Government of Brazil's identification as a priority foreign country
under section 182 of the Trade Act, as amended, by section 1303 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 28, 1993, the USTR initiated an investigation of the Government of Brazil's (Brazil) acts, policies and practices
concerning the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights under section 302(b)(2)(A) of the Trade
Act (19 U.S.C. 2412). See 58 FR 31788 (June 4, 1993). The investigation covered the issues that are the basis for Brazil's
April 30, 1993, identification as a priority foreign country under section 182(a) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2242):
(1) several areas in the patent law; (2) failure to provide copyright protection for software as a literary work, too
short a term of protection for software and penalties for copyright infringement that are insufficient to deter piracy;
(3) inadequate protection for trade secrets; (4) no protection for semiconductor masks works (layout designs);
and (5) significant levels of copyright piracy and trademark counterfeiting. The original deadline for determinations
under section 304(a)(1) of the Trade Act with respect to the investigation was November 28, 1993, but this was extended
until February 28, 1994. See 58 FR 64351 (December 6, 1993).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the context of the five rounds of discussions that took place during the investigation, Brazil indicated that it
has undertaken and will undertake as part of its domestic reform efforts a number of actions to improve the protection
of intellectual property in Brazil, and to provide greater market access for products relying on the protection of
intellectual property. These include improvements in the areas of protection for trademarks, semiconductor mask
works (layout designs), patents and computer programs; market access for computer programs; and improvements in
the enforcement of intellectual property rights, including efforts regarding the importation of pirated and counterfeit
goods and the penalties for infringement of intellectual property rights. Moreover, since initiation of this investigation,
the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations has been successfully completed. Brazil has stated its intention
to present the results of those negotiations for the approval of its Congress, including the provisions of the Agreement
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of the measures that Brazil has undertaken and will take in the future, the USTR has decided to terminate
this investigation. The USTR will monitor Brazil's implementation of these measures under section 306(a)(2) of
the Trade Act. In addition, pursuant to section 182(c)(1)(A) of the Trade Act, the USTR has decided that the information
received warrants revocation of Brazil's identification as a priority foreign country.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
An essential step in achieving our National Education Goals is ensuring that we have high academic expectations for
all students and that each student has the opportunity to fulfill those expectations. Current national, State, and
local efforts to define high standards for what students should know and be able to do in the various subject areas provide
a starting point for creating the type of learning opportunities that an education system of excellence must provide
for all members of an increasingly diverse student population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to provide learning opportunities where more rigorous and complex learning is expected of all students,
teachers will need high-quality, career-long professional development programs. Other educators who help to create
teaching and learning environments that better serve the academic and other needs of students will need similar high-quality
professional development opportunities. Such educators might include school and district administrators, school
and university-based teacher educators, curriculum and supervisory personnel, paraprofessionals/instructional
aides, and members of school boards. To provide effective professional development programs for teachers and other
educators, applicants must ensure that their proposed projects are aligned with high standards for student learning.
Applicants should also consider related standards for teacher effectiveness and for the preparation, credentialling
and continuing development of educators. More specifically, in designing policies and practices for professional
development, applicants are urged to draw on relevant work, as appropriate, from groups such as the National Board
for Professional Teaching Standards, the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium, and the National
Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary recognizes that successful well-articulated programs that provide for continuous improvement of
professional educators from recruitment to retirement will require educators to work together across traditionally
separated roles and organizations. Therefore, projects must be carried out by partnerships. Finally, the design
of professional development efforts must incorporate what is known about developing and managing high-performance
school systems that support education excellence and equity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to direct financial assistance to projects that develop new or further develop existing innovative
partnerships of school, university, community, and other entities to establish and maintain high-quality, standards-based
professional development programs for teachers and other educators. The purpose of these partnerships may be to
improve the entire continuum of professional development or to focus on one or more points along that continuum (e.g.,
preservice, induction, inservice). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with recommendations in the Senate Report that accompanied the Fiscal Year 1994 Department of Education
Appropriation Act, the Secretary supports development of programs based on existing strategies, such as creating
model professional development schools, or applicants' newly designed strategies. The Secretary also recognizes
the need for professional development efforts, as identified in the Senate Report, that prepare educators for working
with other human service professionals to address non-academic student/family problems (e.g., drugs, violence,
nutrition, unemployment) as well as other conditions that place students at-risk for failure in school. The Secretary
is particularly interested in projects that provide relevant development opportunities for educators who work
in urban school communities.

The Secretary strongly encourages the development of challenging and feasible school-based collaborations that
are based upon appropriate research results and exemplary teaching and professional development practices, as
well as the contributions of expert school, higher education, and community practitioners. Emphases might include
collegial strategies such as in-school mentoring for teachers; school-university teams integrating teacher preparation
and school curriculum to effectively educate at-risk students; teacher sabbaticals to work in model schools; and
practitioner-led inquiry and reform activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary will announce the final priority in a notice in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The final priority will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations of
the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, the nature of the final priority,
and the quality of the applications received. The publication of this proposed priority does not preclude the Secretary
from proposing additional priorities; nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only this priority, subject to meeting
applicable rulemaking requirements.

Projects that design and implement innovative, high quality, standards-based preservice, induction and/or inservice
professional development programs for K&hyph;12 teachers and other educators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each project must involve one or more local education agencies (LEAs) working in partnership with one or more institutions
of higher education (IHEs), and others such as State education officials and representatives from professional
organizations, private schools, business, and the community, as appropriate. Programs and activities must be built
upon relevant and current research including a demonstrated relationship between the professional development
approach and lessons learned from relevant research and exemplary practice. A grounding in research findings must
also be evident in the content of the professional development activities.
