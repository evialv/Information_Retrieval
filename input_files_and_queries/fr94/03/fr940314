The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in conformance with amendments to the Federal Employees Pay Comparability
Act of 1990 (FEPCA) made by the Technical and Miscellaneous Civil Service Amendments Act of 1992, is issuing final
regulations to amend the definition of ``law enforcement officer'' for certain pay purposes and expand coverage
of the special maximum limitation on relocation bonuses for law enforcement officers to five additional categories
of law enforcement employees.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 8, 1993, OPM published interim regulations to implement certain provisions of the Technical and Miscellaneous
Civil Service Amendments Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;378, October 2, 1992). These provisions include (1) an expanded
definition of ``law enforcement officer'' in section 5541 of title 5, United States Code (with conforming amendments
in 5 U.S.C. 4521, 5542, and 5547, and section 402 of FEPCA); (2) an amendment to section 404 of FEPCA to provide OPM with
the authority to determine the extent to which a special pay adjustment for law enforcement officers may be paid to
an employee receiving a special salary rate under 5 U.S.C. 5305 or similar provision of law; and (3) an amendment to
section 405 of FEPCA to extend application of the special maximum limitation on relocation bonuses for law enforcement
officers to the categories of law enforcement employees listed in section 405 of FEPCA_i.e., Park Police officers,
Secret Service Uniformed Division officers, special agents in the Diplomatic Security Service, and probation and
pretrial services officers.

The 60-day public comment period ended on March 9, 1993. Comments were received from one Federal agency, one employee
organization, and one individual. These comments are summarized below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Expanded Definition of ``Law Enforcement Officer''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An agency commented that the provisions in the technical amendments to FEPCA providing special pay adjustments for
supervisory and administrative law enforcement employees who are not eligible for special law enforcement retirement
coverage are confusing and that the criteria should be applied consistently across the board. These provisions are
in law, and OPM does not have the authority to change them. The law provides four definitions of ``law enforcement officer''
for purposes of special pay adjustments that differ according to an employee's retirement coverage and whether his
or her position is or is not supervisory or administrative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An employee who meets the definition of ``law enforcement officer'' in section 5541(3) of title 5, United States Code,
must also be subject to the provisions of chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code (Classification), in order to be
entitled to a special pay adjustment provided by section 404 of FEPCA. To meet the definition, an employee must be a
``law enforcement officer'' who_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is subject to the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), is
in a primary (nonsupervisory) or secondary (supervisory or administrative) law enforcement position, and is actually
covered by the corresponding special law enforcement retirement provisions of CSRS or FERS;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is subject to (CSRS), is in a secondary (supervisory or administrative) position that has been approved for law
enforcement retirement purposes, but is not eligible for law enforcement retirement coverage;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is subject to FERS and, as in (2), is in an approved secondary position, but is not eligible for law enforcement retirement
coverage; or

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Is not subject to either CSRS or FERS and is in a position that OPM determines would satisfy one of the other three
conditions cited above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, an employee who has had law enforcement retirement coverage granted retroactively for service while
subject to 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 is entitled to the special pay adjustment retroactively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An agency commented that there is a lack of congruence between the definitions of ``law enforcement officer'' under
CSRS and FERS and that the classification standards should provide specific guidance for linking law enforcement
duties to the definition of ``law enforcement officer'' for retirement purposes. Questions that arise concerning
law enforcement duties for the purpose of determining an employee's entitlement to these special pay adjustments
must be handled within the context of the technical amendments to FEPCA and law enforcement retirement law and regulations.
Such issues are not within the scope of a classification standard. Adding a discussion of these issues to classification
standards would add unnecessarily to the complexity of the standards without adding materially to the quality of
information already provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An employee organization commented that the definitions of ``law enforcement officer'' in these regulations should
provide guidance on specific positions, job series, or duties. Such guidance is beyond the scope of these regulations.
The criteria for approval of a position as a primary or secondary law enforcement position are in 5 CFR part 831, subpart
I, for employees subject to CSRS, and in 5 CFR part 842, subpart H, for employees subject to FERS. Most employees who
are covered by law enforcement retirement provisions are criminal investigators, Border Patrol Agents, Deputy
U.S. Marshals, correctional officers, or support personnel in correctional institutions who have frequent and
direct contact with inmates. Most Federal police officers are not covered by law enforcement retirement provisions.

Basic Pay for Computation of Special Pay Adjustments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An agency commented that some of its attorneys and accountants are on nationwide special rates under 5 U.S.C. 5305
that are not specifically related to law enforcement duties. Some of these attorneys and accountants have been granted
retroactive coverage under the law enforcement retirement provisions. The agency believes special pay adjustments
for LEO's should not be based on nationwide special rates unless the special rates are directly related to law enforcement
duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim regulations for special pay entitlements for law enforcement officers published on January 8, 1993,
provided for computation of special pay adjustments on the basis of a nationwide or worldwide special salary rate
under 5 U.S.C. 5305. Such a rate was included in the definition of ``scheduled annual rate of pay'' in &sect;531.301
of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations.

In developing regulations for the implementation of locality-based comparability payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304,
OPM determined that a special law enforcement adjusted rate of pay should not be based on a nationwide or worldwide
special salary rate under 5 U.S.C. 5305. The final regulations for locality-based comparability payments published
on December 30, 1993, [58 FR 69169] removed special rates of pay under 5 U.S.C. 5305 from the definition of ``scheduled
annual rate of pay'' in &sect;531.301. It should be noted that special pay adjustments continue to be based on the special
rates for law enforcement officers provided by section 403 of FEPCA. For law enforcement officers who were receiving
special pay adjustments on top of special rates under 5 U.S.C. 5305, the regulations established a continued rate
of pay equal to the rate received before this change became effective so that there would be no loss in pay.

The Office of Management and Budget changed the title of the Boston CMSA to the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence, MA&hyph;NH&hyph;ME&hyph;CT
CMSA, effective on June 30, 1993. (Although the title of the Boston CMSA changed, the geographic coverage did not change).
Also, section 628 of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;123,
October 28, 1993), amended section 404 of FEPCA by striking ``Washington, DC&hyph;MD&hyph;VA Metropolitan Statistical
Area'' and inserting in its place ``Washington-Baltimore, DC&hyph;MD&hyph;VA&hyph;WV Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area.'' This amendment became effective on October 28, 1993. Accordingly, OPM is revising the titles
of the Boston and Washington metropolitan statistical areas in paragraph (a) of the definition of ``special pay adjustment
area'' (&sect;531.301) and in the chart in &sect;531.302(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual called OPM staff by telephone and pointed out that an incorrect citation for the definition of ``law
enforcement officer'' was used in 5 CFR 575.302. OPM is revising &sect;575.302 to substitute the correct reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM is taking this opportunity to make technical corrections to two additional regulatory sections to conform with
changes in law. The Technical and Miscellaneous Civil Service Amendments Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;378, October
2, 1992) revised the divisor for computing overtime pay for certain prevailing rate employees (i.e., those employees
whose pay is fixed on either a monthly or annual basis) from 2,080 to 2,087. The amendment became effective on the first
day of the first pay period beginning on or after October 2, 1992. OPM is revising 5 CFR 550.113 accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, OPM is correcting erroneous citations in 5 CFR 531.205(a) (3) and (4) by removing the reference to ``5
U.S.C. 5305'' and inserting ``5 U.S.C. 5303.'' Prior to enactment of FEPCA, annual adjustments to pay schedules were
covered under section 5305 of title 5, United States Code. As a result of the FEPCA amendments, annual adjustments
are now covered under section 5303. The references in &sect;531.205(a) must be changed accordingly.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final regulation to abolish the Champaign, IL, Federal Wage
System nonappropriated fund (NAF) wage area for pay-setting purposes. With the closing of Chanute Air Force Base
in August 1993, the only NAF employees remaining in the Champaign wage area are those located in Vermilion County,
IL. This regulation assigns Vermilion County to the Marion, IN, NAF wage area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 10, 1993, OPM published an interim rule abolishing the Champaign, IL, Federal Wage System NAF wage area
and assigning Vermilion County, IL, to the Marion, IN, wage area (58 FR 59639). OPM received no comments during the
30-day comment period. However, the interim regulation gave a March 4, 1994, effective date coinciding with the anticipated
effective date of the Marion wage schedule (reflecting the 90-day delay required by law since 1984). Since the publication
of the interim rule, Public Law 103&hyph;123, which phases out the 90-day delay, was enacted. The new law provides
that wage adjustments will be effective on the later of the normal wage adjustment date for the wage area or the first
day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 1994. The normal wage adjustment dates for both the Champaign
and Marion wage areas were in December 1933. Hence under the new law, wage adjustments for both of these wage areas would
be effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 1994. Because of the interim rule
abolishing the Champaign NAF wage area, there is no new wage schedule for Champaign. In order that Vermilion County
employees may receive a pay adjustment in January 1994, as required by Public Law 103&hyph;123, the effective date
of the wage area redefinition must be changed from March 4, 1994, to January 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of title 5 of the United States Code, I find that good cause exists to make this amendment
effective in less than 30 days. The regulation is being made effective retroactively to January 1, 1994, so that Vermilion
County employees may receive the pay adjustment required by Public Law 103&hyph;123.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Will not preempt any
State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule; (2)
will not have any retroactive effect; and (3) will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file
suit challenging the provisions of this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on current and historical funding levels for this program and a projected average size loan and/or grant in
the range of $300,000 to $400,000, it is estimated that 50 to 60 loans and/or grants will be made nationwide each year.
It is projected that the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program will have a limited impact upon small businesses
because of the program's unique delivery system; i.e., loans and grants will be made through REA financed electric
and telephone cooperatives or companies. These entities do not operate as credit institutions, thus they do not seek
funds for the expressed purpose of loan portfolio expansion. Rather, REA financed entities request REA funding through
this program to enhance economic development in rural areas by funding a limited number of selected development projects.
Since credit is channeled to areas which are generally underdeveloped and financially depressed, job creation and
economic development resulting from newly emerging businesses and community facilities funded by REA does not pose
undue competition or other adverse effects upon existing businesses. Therefore, this final rule will have no effect
upon businesses or entities other than those to be funded through this program.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 15, 1989, REA published the final rule, 7 CFR 1709, subpart B, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 6867), implementing the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program to provide funds to REA Borrowers
under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 USC 901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Act). This program provides zero-interest loans to REA Borrowers for the promotion of rural economic development
and job creation projects. On September 27, 1990, REA changed the designation of this rule from 7 CFR part 1709 to part
1703 (55 FR 39394). On September 25, 1992, REA published a final rule in 7 CFR 1703 subpart B (57 FR 44317) to revise the
loan program. The revision provided additional information to potential applicants on the selection factors and
rating criteria, allowed monthly submittal of applications and established a maximum amount of project funding
as a fixed percentage of allocated funds. Subsequently, a proposed rule was published on October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52688),
to establish procedures for approving and administering grants and make minor changes to enhance the overall program
delivery for the zero-interest loan and grant program. This final rule contains the provisions set forth in the proposed
rule published October 12, 1993.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains provisions for grant funds to be used for the following purposes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The establishment and/or operation of a revolving loan fund by REA Borrowers; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Pass-through grants in conjunction with loans for: (a) Project feasibility studies and technical assistance
for community development, business start-ups, business planning, and market research, (b) business incubators
established by non-profit organizations, (c) community development assistance by non-profit organizations,
(d) projects operated on a profit or non-profit basis that enhance the overall quality of medical care of rural residents,
and (e) projects by profit or non-profit organizations which encourage the use of advanced telecommunications for
educational and medical services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several conditions for grant making have been established under this program in order to maximize the benefits of
the grant program, conserve the limited funds available, and provide for the efficient administration of grant making
by REA: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. With the exception of the establishment and/or operation of a revolving loan program, grants will be made only in
conjunction with rural development loans. For grants to REA Borrowers to establish revolving loan funds, REA Borrowers
will be required to commit their funds in an amount no less than 20 percent of the REA grant. For all other projects eligible
for loan and grant funding, that portion of project cost eligible for REA funding may be funded up to 20 percent with
grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. As with zero-interest loans, all REA projects funded with grants will require a minimum of 20 percent supplemental
funding for project costs. Supplemental funds may come from the project owner in the form of equity funds, private
sources, state and local government sources, other Federal Government sources, the borrower, or other sources.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. For grants made in conjunction with zero-interest loans, grant funding will be provided only in sufficient amount
necessary for a feasible project. A project which generates sufficient revenue to show feasibility without grant
funds is not eligible for a grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In determining the eligible amount of a grant, REA will base the appropriate amount of grant funding on a typical
year of operation, when the project has generally reached its target income earning potential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Grant funding will be channeled, to the extent practicable, to non-profit entities which have a broad impact on
rural economies. However, grant funding will be available for project feasibility studies and technical assistance
irrespective of entity status. Also, grant funding will be provided irrespective of entity status for enhancement
of medical care and advanced telecommunications for educational and medical services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to grant making provisions, several changes have been made to the loan provisions of the Rural Economic
Development Loan and Grant Program. These changes, addressed in detail in the proposed rule published on October
12, 1993, are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Paragraph (d) of &sect;1703.21 has been revised to require Borrowers to deposit zero-interest loan funds into
their construction accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Paragraph (b) of &sect;1703.28 has been revised to eliminate the $400,000 limitation on the size of zero-interest
loans and grants and set the maximum amount not to exceed 3 percent of the projected amount of zero-interest loan and
grant funds available each year. However, the REA Administrator will retain the authority to limit funding below
the 3 percent level, and a decision in this regard will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for each fiscal year. For fiscal year 1994, the REA Administrator has determined the maximum amount of a loan and grant
to be $400,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To provide REA Borrowers additional flexibility to fund worthwhile community development projects, paragraph
(e) of &sect;1703.46 has been eliminated to remove the prohibition against funding recreational facilities unless
they convincingly demonstrate that they would be an integral part of a tourism industry in their area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Paragraph (b) of &sect;1703.61 has been amended to clarify that the grant portion of the zero-interest loan and
grant will be disbursed to the borrower only upon completion of the project. This will ensure that grant funds are handled
so as to minimize the time between disbursement and authorized use to comply with USDA's Federal Assistance Uniform
Regulation, 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Paragraph (b) of &sect;1703.66 has been revised to require the recipients of pass-through loans and grants to
furnish a record of receipts showing total project costs to verify that no greater than 80 percent of project costs
have been funded with REA zero-interest loan and grant funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Paragraph (e) of &sect;1703.66 has been revised to allow REA field accountants to provide a rural economic development
review of zero-interest loans and grant funds. This revision will, in many cases, save REA Borrowers thousands of
dollars by eliminating costs of formal audits which were previously required in accordance with the provisions of
7 CFR part 1773, ``REA Policy on Audits of Electric and Telephone Borrowers.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Paragraph (g) of &sect;1703.66 has been revised to clarify that for pass-through zero-interest loans and grants,
REA Borrowers must require project owners to provide sufficient financial, accounting and budget information,
and other records deemed necessary to facilitate audits in accordance with 7 CFR part 3015 and 7 CFR part 3016, as appropriate
for non-profit entities, and REA rural economic development loan reviews for projects in a for-profit status. Likewise,
paragraph (g) has been revised to require REA Borrowers receiving grants for establishment of revolving loan funds
to furnish information to allow audits in accordance with USDA departmental grant regulations. Copies of these grant
regulations are available to REA Borrowers by request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments from various organizations including REA Borrowers, electric and telephone utility trade organizations,
economic development organizations and state governments reflected broad support for the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the organizations made specific recommendations on the proposed rule. REA has considered all comments in
finalizing this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of the comments were from entities that administer existing Revolving Loan Funds (RLFs) or organizations
representing entities that administer revolving loan programs. These organizations feel that grants should not
be directed to REA Borrowers exclusively, but also to existing organizations not financed by REA that operate RLFs,
since REA Borrowers do not serve all of rural America. They also are concerned that they would be unable to compete with
the REA Borrowers' revolving funds zero-interest rate loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, grants, as well as zero-interest loans administered exclusively through REA Borrowers are in accordance
with directives established in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987, (Pub. L. 100&hyph;102, 101 Stat. 1330&hyph;20).
This law was created in a context where electric and telephone Borrowers who had made prepayments on loans into cushion
of credit accounts could utilize a Rural Development Subaccount to collectively draw from the interest earnings
from the Borrowers' cumulative credit resources to reinvest into local economic development projects. The provisions
of the proposed rule making grant funds available exclusively to REA Borrowers, as a result of their prepayments,
are governed by legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA acknowledges, however, that many rural development organizations are well qualified to administer grant funds,
and they provide a valuable resource for local or regional rural economic development efforts. REA will strongly
encourage Borrowers operating revolving loan funds to collaborate with existing organizations involved in rural
development activities, and those organizations are urged to work with REA Borrowers in facilitating rural development
projects. This collaboration and assistance could include performing local or regional studies to identify area
economic development needs, assisting community leaders and other project owners in planning and implementing
projects, loan packaging, technical assistance to REA Borrowers in reviewing loan applications and administering
the revolving loan fund, and coordinating efforts between other entities, including public and private lending
institutions, that provide assistance and/or funding to rural development projects. REA also encourages state
Rural Development Councils to become active participants in planning rural development projects and coordinating
activities between local governments, economic development districts, REA Borrowers and other entities operating
RLFs. However, although collaboration between REA Borrowers and other enitities is strongly encouraged, legislation
requires that REA Borrowers retain the ultimate decision-making authority and responsibility for REA rural development
loan and grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding possible competition between REA Borrowers and other lenders, it should be emphasized that REA does not
intend for REA Borrowers to compete with or replace existing services of RLFs, or other public or private lenders,
but merely to augment or supplement those sources of funds. To clarify this policy, and ensure effective implementation,
&sect;1703.22(b) has been revised to require Borrowers, within their RLF rural development plan, to document coordination
of lending activities with local organizations operating RLFs and other area lenders. The rule requires such documentation
to indicate that Borrowers will not compete with, but will supplement other legal sources of financing. Rural development
plan documentation which complies with REA policy will be stipulated in RLF agreements between Borrowers and REA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters expressed concern that the administrative burden for operating RLFs would be too great and REA Borrowers
may choose not to participate. REA has minimized administrative requirements; thus the burden should be no greater
for the RLFs than for zero-interest loans. Although the REA Borrowers will decide whether or not to establish RLFs,
REA believes the potential of significant benefits to rural residents through the RLF provisions will encourage
participation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were a number of recommendations concerning purposes eligible for funding, including comments that REA should
make grant funds available for businesses in a for-profit status. REA believes there is adequate flexibility with
the rule as written regarding eligible projects. The quality of the proposal and the degree of benefit to the rural
community or the potential for economic development are determining factors in application approval. It should
be noted that rural for-profit and non-profit projects alike may be able to obtain grant funds in conjunction with
zero-interest loans for feasibility studies and technical assistance. In addition, for-profit as well as non-profit
entities that enhance the overall quality of medical care or provide advanced telecommunications services or computer
networks for medical and educational services may be considered for grants because they may facilitate projects
which will improve the rural communities overall and provide needed services to rural America. However, generally,
REA desires to fund non-profit entities, since grants to for-profit entities for direct business start-up costs
could result in the possibility or perception that grants would provide certain for-profit entities an unfair competitive
advantage over those entities not receiving REA funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was also suggested that housing be included as eligible for funding under the regulation. REA recognizes the value
of adequate housing in developing rural areas. However, REA believes other federal programs are available to provide
housing, and grant funds will be better utilized to provide broader community-wide facilities and infrastructure
improvements. REA Borrowers may, in accordance with a rural development plan for a revolving loan fund, provide housing
assistance from those funds classified as non-Federal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, it was suggested that grant funds be used for venture capital purposes. The focus of the rural economic development
loan and grant program is to allow REA Borrowers to assist projects that will promote rural development. REA intends
to be flexible in meeting this objective; thus, applications will be evaluated on a case by case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were several objections to linking grants to zero-interest loans. Some comments urged direct grants for feasibility
studies and technical assistance be provided to non-profit entities and that grants be made outright, without loans,
to economically distressed local governments. REA feels that grants for feasibility studies or technical assistance
will most likely be effectively used in conjunction with loans. Grants in conjunction with loans strengthen the loan
program and maximize the benefits derived from the limited amount of grant funding available. No change is being made
to allow direct grants to economically distressed local governments; however, provisions of the program as written
will enable REA Borrowers to facilitate economic development in distressed rural areas by funding worthwhile community
development and job creation projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested that the 10 percent limitation for using grant funds for administrative costs of the RLFs
be revised to provide more flexibility in determining these costs. No change is being made to the program at this time.
REA feels that limiting the funds used for administrative costs will be an incentive to encourage REA Borrowers to
stress prudent management of the funds and maximize the benefits for rural development. REA encourages interested
rural development organizations to work with REA Borrowers to minimize overhead costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters felt REA's grant funding limitation of 80 percent of the cost of establishing the revolving fund,
which will require 20 percent supplemental funding to the revolving loan fund by the Borrower, is overly restrictive.
These organizations stated that this Borrower supplemental funding requirement, and the supplemental funding
requirement for individual projects, was too burdensome. Additionally, commentors objected to requiring projects
be funded by REA Borrowers ``up-front.'' This requirement was set forth in the proposed rule's preamble paragraph
entitled ``The establishment and/or Operation of a Revolving Loan Fund by REA Borrowers'', &sect;1703.22(a)(3)
relating to supplemental funding requirements, and &sect;1703.22(h)(2), ``Requisition requirements'', which
requires Borrowers be reimbursed 80 percent of funds expended for approved projects. REA believes the supplemental
funding requirement should remain applicable for Borrowers establishing revolving loan funds, as well as supplemental
funding for individual projects presently required for zero-interest pass-through loans. REA has found that the
supplemental funding requirement specified in &sect;1703.23 of the regulation, as applied to individual projects,
has been beneficial for the zero-interest loan program by maximizing the use of outside funds. Likewise, REA believes
the Borrower supplemental funding requirement for the revolving loan fund will be equally beneficial for the grant
selection process by evidencing a degree of Borrower support and commitment to the revolving loan fund, and it will
provide REA adequate assurance of effective project review and oversight resulting in projects having a high probability
of success.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, REA recognizes that reimbursing Borrowers only 80 percent of funds expended ``up front'' for community
development projects, in order to achieve Borrowers' 20 percent required contribution to RLFs, may place an undue
financial burden upon some Borrowers and discourage program participation. In addition, REA recognizes that requiring
Borrowers to initially exhaust their financial resources, as well as the REA grant funds, will result in no available
funds for Borrowers' revolving funds during the first year or two of operation until payments from the funded community
development projects are received. Therefore, REA has modified the proposed rule in &sect;1703.22(h)(2), ``Requisition
requirements'', to remove the 80 percent reimbursement provision and allow for full reimbursement of Borrowers'
expended funds for approved projects funded. However, consistent with the supplemental funding requirements for
individual projects, as well as revolving loan funds set forth in the proposed rule, Borrowers' supplemental funding
requirements to the revolving loan fund will be maintained. Accordingly, paragraph (a)(5) in &sect;1703.22 of the
final rule has been added to require REA Borrowers establishing RLFs to submit a commitment, in the form of a board resolution,
to provide supplemental funding, referred to as ``additional funding'' in an amount no less than 20 percent of the
REA grant approved. The Borrower will be required to provide documentation that the additional funding has been deposited
in the appropriate account in &sect;1703.22(h)(1) of this final rule prior to grant disbursement. This paragraph
also reiterates the requirement in &sect;1703.22(g)(2) in the proposed rule requiring additional funding be retained
within the revolving loan fund. Additional funding for revolving loan funds may be retained initially as non-Federal
funds for any rural economic development project(s), subject to the normal requirements outlined in &sect;1703.22(g).
For example, for a $400,000 revolving loan fund grant from REA, the Borrower may requisition 100 percent of REA's portion
of eligible project costs. However, the REA Borrower will commit at least $80,000 (20 percent of $400,000) of additional
funds to be used for rural economic development projects in accordance with an approved rural development plan for
non-Federal funds. Since the Borrower's funds provided as additional funds may be considered non-Federal monies
and not subject to ``Federal monies'' restrictions for the Rural Economic Loan and Grant Program as outlined in the
regulation, the REA Borrower can retain a worthwhile degree of flexibility to fund projects during the first year
of the revolving loan fund. It should be noted, however, that as with pass-through zero-interest loans and grants,
projects funded with Federal grant funds under the revolving loan provision will be subject to the supplemental funding
requirements as outlined in &sect;1703.23 of the Rural Economic Loan and Grant Program regulation. As pointed out
in the comments, REA recognizes that many projects may have limited sources of supplemental funding available. In
this regard, therefore, REA has provided a provision in &sect;1703.22(a)(5), whereby Borrowers, with prior approval
from REA, may use all or a portion of their additional funding to assist project owners receiving funding through the
revolving loan provisions to meet their supplemental funding requirements required by &sect;1703.23. In this case,
such additional funding will be considered as Federal funds and subject to the requirements and restrictions of the
regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, several technical changes have been made to the proposed regulation for clarification as follows: (1) Section
1703.21(d) has been revised to clarify that excess interest returned to REA will not be used to reduce principal indebtedness.
(2) For revolving loan funds, &sect;1703.22(a)(4) has been revised to clarify that reasonable servicing fees may
be charged regardless of whether Federal or non-Federal funds are involved. (3) Section 1703.20(a)(8) has been revised
to clarify that the overall restriction for using zero-interest loan and grant funds for payment of Borrower salaries
is subject to the operating expense allowance for revolving loan funds. (4) Section 1703.22(h)(1) has been revised
to add to the accounting requirements, additional ledger accounts to record interest income. (5) Section 1703.22(g)(2)
has been clarified to require Borrowers to retain interest earned from non-Federal funds within the revolving fund
to be used in accordance with their approved Rural Development Plan and Scope of Work Plan. (6) Section 1703.22(g)(3)
has been revised to require REA Borrowers that terminate the revolving loan program without obtaining approval by
the REA Administrator to return the amount of the original grant to REA. (7) Section 1703.22(h)(2) has been revised
to delete the requirement for account ledgers to be submitted as a prerequisite for requisitioning grant funds for
revolving loan funds. (8) Section 1703.66(g) has been revised to require REA Borrowers to include in their legal documents
the requirement for project owners to provide sufficient financial, accounting and budget information and other
records deemed necessary to facilitate audits in accordance with 7 CFR part 3015 and 7 CFR part 3016 for non-profit
entities, and REA rural economic development loan reviews for projects in a for-profit status.

project. Feasibility studies will include management assistance, consultation, and research for planning individual
projects that the Borrower has determined will benefit the rural community. Feasibility studies which may be financed
under this section must be performed by qualified entities subject to &sect;1703.19(i), General requirements for
grant funding. Feasibility studies must address the important aspects of project assessment and planning to ensure,
to the extent practicable, the success of projects. These include the market, technical, economic, financial, and
managerial issues related to project feasibility. Feasibility studies may be funded in connection with viable projects
as a reimbursement to the project owner for expenses incurred during the initial planning stages of the project prior
to project funding by REA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The acquisition of technical assistance in conjunction with projects funded with zero-interest loans to enable
for-profit and non-profit entities to obtain analysis of facilities and processes, managerial, financial and operational
consultation. Grant funds may also be used in conjunction with zero-interest loans to enable non-profit business
incubators to provide technical assistance. Technical assistance will enable project owners to identify and evaluate
problems or potential problems and provide training in order that they may ultimately implement, manage, operate
and maintain viable projects which are financed with zero-interest loan funds. Technical assistance financed under
this section must be performed by qualified entities which are independent of the project owner subject to &sect;1703.19(i),

&sect;1703.19 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
General requirements for grant funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Grants made under &sect;1703.18(a), establishment and operation of a revolving loan program by Borrowers, will
be limited to Borrowers and can be made without zero-interest loans. Grants made under &sect;1703.18 (b) through
(h) will be made only in conjunction with zero-interest loans, and on a pass-through basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Pass-through grant funding for projects under &sect;1703.18 (b), (c), (f), (g) and (h) will be available for non-profit
and for-profit entities. Pass-through grant funding for projects under &sect;1703.18 (d) and (e) will be available
only for non-profit entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All projects funded with zero-interest loans and grants will require supplemental funding in accordance with
&sect;1703.23. For grants made under &sect;1703.18(a), the portion eligible for REA funding may be fully funded
with grant funds. For all other grants funded under 1703.18, the portion of project costs eligible for REA funding
may be funded up to 20 percent with grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Grant funding will be provided only to the extent necessary for a feasible project. A feasible project is a project
which expects to generate sufficient income to pay operating expenses and debts and compensate for depreciation
of equipment and facilities for the project which is to be funded by REA. Depreciation must be based on allowable depreciation
schedules as set forth by the United States Internal Revenue Service. Borrowers whose analyses of projects show feasibility
without grant funds should not apply for grant funding. Borrowers requesting pass-through grant funds will base
grant funding requests on borrower projected income and expense projections for the project, and documentation
regarding depreciation of the equipment and facilities for the project. The Administrator will determine whether
the Borrower's projections of income, expenses and depreciation are reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) For projects that project insufficient operating revenue the first two years to show feasibility, borrowers
should first consider the deferral provisions set forth in &sect;1703.29(b) before determining the appropriate
level of requested grant funding. Zero-interest loan and grant funding will be approved in accordance with paragraph
(d) of this section based on the option which results in the lowest required grant percentage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The owner of the pass-through project that receives grant funds will be encouraged to commit that the project will
be a demonstration project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Borrowers or project owners must demonstrate the availability and commitment of other sources of funding needed
to complete a project in addition to REA loan and/or grant funds, prior to the first advance of REA funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Feasibility studies and/or technical assistance funded with grants under &sect;1703.18 (b) and (c) must be performed
by entities which are independent of the Borrower and qualified to provide such services. The project owner, if deemed
qualified in accordance with this paragraph, may furnish a feasibility study under &sect;1703.18(b). Entities
furnishing technical assistance under &sect;1703.18(c), must be independent of the project owner. To be deemed
qualified, entities providing feasibility studies and/or technical assistance must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provide sufficient documentation evidencing their proven ability, background and experience to furnish such
services; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provide sufficient documentation evidencing their legal authority and capacity to furnish such services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Zero-interest loans and grants must not be used: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To fund or assist projects of which any director, officer, general manager or significant stockholder of the Borrower,
or close relative thereof, is an owner, stockholder, partner or director, or which would, in the judgment of the Administrator,
create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. The Borrower must disclose to the Administrator
information regarding any conflict of interest, potential conflict of interest or any appearance of a conflict of
interest. The Administrator will determine whether there is a conflict of interest or whether any potential conflict
of interest or appearance of a conflict of interest may adversely affect REA's interests. A Borrower organized as,
or consisting of a cooperative, widely held mutual corporation, tribal government, municipal power corporation,
public power district, or a similar widely held organization would ordinarily be able to have an ownership interest
in or manage a project operated on either a for-profit or non-profit basis. A Borrower organized as a closely held,
for-profit corporation with more than 5 percent of its stock held by one legal person, its subsidiary or an affiliate,
would ordinarily be able to own or manage a project operated on a non-profit basis only;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For site development, the destruction or alteration of buildings, or other activities that would adversely

(3) By the Borrower to purchase or lease any real property, materials, equipment, or services from its subsidiary,
an affiliate, or significant stockholders, officers, managers or directors of the Borrower, or close relatives
thereof, where the purchase or lease has not been fully disclosed to the Administrator and received the Administrator's
prior written approval; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) By the recipient of a pass-through-loan or pass-through-grant to purchase or lease any real property, materials,
equipment, or services from the Borrower, its subsidiary, an affiliate of the Borrower, or significant stockholders,
officers, managers or directors of the Borrower, or close relatives thereof, where the purchase or lease has not been
fully disclosed to the Administrator and received the Administrator's prior written approval; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) To pay off or refinance existing indebtedness incurred prior to receipt of the Borrower's completed application
by REA or for refinancing or repaying a loan made under the Act or a program administered by the Administrator; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) For any electric or telephone purpose, as determined by the Administrator; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) For the Borrower's electric or telephone operations or for any operations affiliated with the Borrower unless
the Administrator has specifically informed the Borrower in writing that the operations are part of the approved
purposes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) To pay the salaries of any employee or owner of the Borrower, its subsidiaries, or affiliates. This restriction
does not prohibit the use of loan or grant funds for printing and similar costs for project feasibility studies it has
prepared, commissioned or purchased if specifically approved by the Administrator. This restriction is subject
to the operating expense allowance for revolving loan funds set forth in &sect;1703.22 (a)(6); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) To fund feasibility studies and technical assistance as set forth in &sect;1703.18 independently of projects
which are funded under the zero-interest loan and grant program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) For proposed projects located in areas covered by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3501

(d) The Borrower may not requisition zero-interest loan funds unless those funds are deposited into the Borrower's
REA construction fund trustee account. The Borrower will be required to set up a separate Federally insured account
called the Rural Economic Development Account, if loan funds are not expected to be disbursed within two months after
receipt from REA. All interest earned on temporarily deposited zero-interest loan funds in excess of $500 per 12-month
period must be used for approved purposes or returned to REA. Interest earned in excess of $500 per 12 month period and
returned to REA will not be used to reduce the Borrower's principal indebtedness. Grant funds will be disbursed by
REA in accordance with 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016, and &sect;1703.61 (b).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Grant funds disbursed to REA Borrowers to establish revolving loan programs under this section are subject to the
following requirements: (1) The uses, restrictions and limitations for zero-interest loans set forth in &sect;&sect;1703.17,
1703.20 and 1703.21 respectively; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Loans made by REA Borrowers initially lending grant funds disbursed by REA are limited to types of projects specified
in &sect;1703.18 (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h). Loans may also be made for feasibility studies and technical assistance
in accordance with &sect;1703.18 (b) and (c), respectively, but only for those types of projects specified in this
paragraph (a)(2). Loans made from repayments of the initial loans made by REA Borrowers may be used for any rural economic
development purpose in accordance with a prior agreement between the Borrower and REA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) All other requirements relevant to zero-interest pass-through loans and grants outlined in this subpart, except
the minimum size of a zero-interest loan as specified in &sect;1703.28(f); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The initial loans made from the revolving loan fund using the grant funds must carry an interest rate of zero percent;
however, loans made from repayments of the initial loan may carry an interest rate in accordance with prior agreement
with REA. In either case, the Borrower may charge reasonable loan servicing fees;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Borrower will provide a board resolution certifying a commitment to provide and maintain additional funding
to the revolving loan fund in an amount no less than 20 percent of the REA grant approved. The Borrower will provide documentation
that the additional funding has been deposited in the appropriate account in &sect;1703.22(h)(1) prior to grant
disbursement. This requirement does not pertain to supplemental funding requirements for individual projects
as set forth in &sect;1703.23. Additional funding required in this paragraph pertains only to borrowers establishing
revolving loan funds, with the following provisions: (i) Use of additional funding is subject to requirements set
forth in paragraph (b) of this section and with REA concurrence;

(ii) Individual projects funded under this section are subject to supplemental funds requirements set forth in &sect;1703.23;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) At the Borrower's option with REA concurrence, all or a portion of the additional funding may be used to assist
project owners receiving funding from Federal grant funds under this section to meet their supplemental funding
requirements set forth in &sect;1703.23 of this subpart. Such additional funding will be deemed as Federal funds
and accounted for in accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section for electric borrowers or paragraph
(h)(1)(ii)(A) of this section for telephone borrowers, as appropriate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) At the Borrower's option, all or a portion of the additional funding may be retained as non-Federal funds, for
any rural economic development project(s), subject to paragraph (g) of this section and REA concurrence. Additional
funding committed as non-Federal will be accounted for in accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(i)(E) of this section
for electric borrowers or paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(E) of this section for telephone borrowers, as appropriate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(6) Grant funds will only be provided to an REA Borrower for a revolving loan program when a proposed budget submitted
to REA demonstrates and the Borrower agrees in writing that no more than 10 percent of grant funds received are used
to cover operating expenses of the revolving loan program. Operating expenses include the costs of administering
the revolving loan fund and the provision of technical assistance to project owners. All proceeds in excess of those
needed to cover authorized expenses, as described above, must revert to the revolving fund and be available for re-lending
for eligible projects. Budgets which reflect expenses incurred in operating the fund must be submitted to REA annually;

must not exceed an amount equal to the sum of one percent per year of the outstanding principal on the first day of each
year on each project owner's zero-interest loan which is made from the REA grant proceeds; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The Borrower will submit documentation indicating that potential projects which are eligible for funding have
sufficiently progressed in the planning stage to allow grant funding approved for a revolving loan program to be requisitioned
by the Borrower, disbursed by REA, and loaned to recipients within 3 years of the date of grant approval by REA. Grant
funds that have not been requisitioned within 3 years will be cancelled, unless the Administrator has approved an
extension in writing. Grant funds will be disbursed by REA in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Payment of creditors which provide interim or construction financing to a viable project for eligible purposes
as set forth in &sect;1703.17 of this subpart may be authorized. Refinancing for the sole purpose of replacing higher
interest conventional financing with zero-interest revolving loan funds is not authorized.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Borrower's rural development plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA requires that the revolving loan program be administered in accordance with a rural development plan, developed
by the Borrower and approved by REA. The plan must be of sufficient detail to provide REA with a complete understanding
of what the Borrower intends to accomplish by administering a revolving loan program. The rural development plan
will provide the mechanics of how the revolving loan funds will be disbursed to the project owner. The rural development
plan must outline the Borrower's plans for administering the revolving loan program, during the initial period when
REA grant funds are lent by the Borrower and after the revolving fund becomes non-Federal in accordance with paragraph
(g) of this section. The plan must outline the following: (1) Specific objectives for the revolving loan program,
revolving loan operating procedures, lending parameters, maximum and minimum loan amount, and types of projects
to be funded; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Documentation of Borrower's coordination of lending activities with other local entities that provide financing
for rural economic development projects. Such documentation will indicate that the Borrower will not compete with,
but supplement other sources of legal financing;

the items on the list of expenditures that at least total the amount of the REA zero-interest loan and grant. In addition,
the Borrower will also require the recipient to furnish a record of itemized receipts showing total project costs
in such detail that will permit auditors to establish the REA funding percentage. REA's legal agreements will include
the terms and conditions that the Borrower must require in its agreement with the recipient of a pass-through loan

and requirements of the executed legal documents. Regardless of any right or remedy the Administrator chooses to
assert, if the Borrower uses any zero-interest loan and/or grant funds other than for approved purposes, the Borrower
will be required to return to REA the amount used for unapproved purposes. An unauthorized zero-interest loan amount
which is returned will be considered a prepayment on the REA note.

(g) Grants provided under this program will be administered in accordance with 7 CFR part 3015 and 7 CFR part 3016, as
appropriate. Copies of these USDA Uniform Assistance regulations can be obtained by contacting REA in Washington,
DC. A Borrower that receives a grant for the establishment of a revolving loan fund, or project owner that receives
a pass-through loan and grant, will be subject to requirements under these regulations which cover, among other things,
financial reporting, accounting records, budget controls, record retention and audit requirements. For pass-through
loans and grants, REA Borrowers will be required to include in their legal documents the requirement for project owners
to provide sufficient financial, accounting and budget information and other records deemed necessary to facilitate
audits in accordance with 7 CFR part 3015 and 7 CFR part 3016 for non-profit entities, and REA rural economic development
loan reviews for projects in a for-profit status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Termination for cause. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator may terminate any loan and/or grant in whole, or in part, at any time before the date of completion
of loan and/or grant disbursement, whenever the Borrower has failed to comply with the conditions of the loan and/or
grant. The Administrator will promptly notify the Borrower in writing of the determination and the reasons for the
termination, together with the effective date. The termination date will be no less than 30 days following receipt
of the termination notice. The Borrower will have such time to cure the default, or to state why it feels the loan and/or
grant should not be terminated. The Administrator will stay the termination upon the curing of the default, and may
delay termination if, sufficient cause has been given by the Borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Termination for convenience. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator or the Borrower may terminate a loan and/or grant in whole, or in part, when both parties agree that
the continuation of the project would not produce beneficial results commensurate with further expenditure of funds.
The two parties will agree upon termination conditions, including the effective date, and in the case of partial terminations,
the portion to be terminated. The Borrower will not incur new obligations for the terminated portion after the effective
date, and will cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. The Administrator will allow full credit to the
Borrower for the Federal share of unfulfilled contractual obligations which were incurred in good faith by the Borrower
prior to grant termination.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, that requires certain maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake wear limits to be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. This amendment also requires that the Airplane Flight Manual be revised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include certain procedures concerning operations in the event of a rejected takeoff (RTO). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment is prompted by an accident in which a transport category airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
executed an RTO and was unable to stop on the runway due to worn brakes; and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent review of allowable brake wear limits for all transport category airplanes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a high energy RTO.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 1, 1993 (58 FR 58307). That action proposed to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain maximum brake wear limits be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection program; and that the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) be revised to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain procedures concerning operations in the event of a rejected takeoff (RTO). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter, the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need for the proposed AD. This commenter is aware of the FAA's efforts to review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and determine allowable aircraft brake wear limits, since those efforts prompted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuance of a series of AD's, applicable to U.S.-manufactured airplanes, to mandate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum brake wear limits. While those U.S.-manufactured airplanes were certified to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new brake criteria, the commenter points out that airplanes such as the Fokker Model F28 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mark 0100, which were certified under the Joint Airworthiness Regulations (JAR) criteria, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are certified to worn brake standards. In light of this, the commenter questions why the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA indicated that the proposed AD was prompted by the 1988 accident involving worn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes on a McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 airplane. This commenter states that U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators of Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, at the time of airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivery, implemented within their maintenance programs the same worn brake criteria as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the notice; additionally, these operators' FAA-approved AFM's already reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this criteria. Therefore, this commenter argues that there is no basis for adopting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule unless it can be shown that U.S. operators cannot safely administer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified brake wear criteria within their approved maintenance programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA does not concur with this commenter's suggestion that this AD action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not appropriate. The accident involving the Model DC&hyph;10 was the primary reason 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prompting this AD and the previously-issued AD's to mandate specific maximum brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wear limits on transport category airplane. During the process of promulgating those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD's, the FAA became aware that not all operators were following the manufacturer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended brake wear limits. For example, in one case, three different operators of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same model of airplane were found to be observing three different maximum brake wear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits. Further, the FAA is aware that, until recently, not all manufacturers had provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake wear limits that met the FAA criteria, e.g., landing distance predicated upon single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine-out, maximum takeoff weight, and fully worn brakes. The purpose of this AD is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no way an attempt to question the ability of U.S. operators to safely administer to brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wear limits criteria; its purpose is to establish what those brake wear limits are. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to eliminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to replace the landing gear sliding member after an RTO event. One of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters suggests that, instead of requiring replacement, the proposed rule could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require inspections of the sliding member, using procedures that are currently included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Fokker F28 Mark 0100 Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) 05&hyph;51&hyph;01. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter states that similar inspection procedures exist for most other commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aircraft, and those procedures have proven to be a safe and effective method of evaluating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landing gears for the effects of high brake heat. This commenter also suggests that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional procedures could include inspection of the axles for evidence of discolored or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peeling paint with cadmium plating that is blistered, wrinkled, or mottled (signs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cadmium melting and resolidifying). Cadmium melts at 610 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, which is very close to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tempering temperature of ultra-high strength steels; therefore, if the cadmium is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
melted, it is unlikely that any heat damage has been done to the steel sliding member axle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter notes that this criteria has been used for other aircraft, and this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter plans to contact Fokker to request that this type of inspection criteria be added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Fokker F28 Mark 0100 AMM. Further, another commenter states that, on other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aircraft models in its fleet, it regularly performs a visual inspection of the pistons following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an RTO to determine the amount of heat that the piston has been subjected to; the degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of discoloration of the paint on the axle and the amount of damage to the hydraulic hoses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are evidence of the amount of heat. This commenter also plans to contact Fokker to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request the inclusion of this inspection in the AMM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur with the suggestion to revise the proposed rule, at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at this time. The FAA has queried Fokker directly about the inspection procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested by these commenters; however, Fokker was not aware of any effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nondestructive inspection technique that can be used to establish whether cadmium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
embrittlement has taken place on the axle after an RTO. Fokker did indicate that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently working with the manufacturer of the brakes to devise a way to limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure of the sliding member to heat from the brakes, which in turn would limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to replace the sliding member. Once an inspection or other procedure is developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would preclude the necessity of replacing the sliding member, the FAA would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider further rulemaking on this issue. In the meantime, under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (d) of the final rule, the FAA would consider requests for the use of alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods of complying with this rule, provided sufficient data are presented to justify such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the proposed entry in the maintenance program [as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in paragraph (b) of the proposal] and the proposed entry in the AFM [as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in paragraph (c) of the proposal] be revised. This commenter states that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations have shown that only when ``flap 0'' is selected, there is a possibility to reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an energy level that can cause the axle to overheat. Therefore, those entries should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include a statement that, during the RTO scenario, the flaps would have to be at 0 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degrees. The commenter suggests that the wording of both entries be changed to read as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
If flap 0 is selected, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
and if a takeoff is rejected at a speed greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
90 percent of *&blank;*&blank;*'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA concurs and has revised paragraphs (b) and (c) of the final rule accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This same commenter suggests that the AFM entry proposed in paragraph (c) be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reworded to include language that is more familiar to pilots, who will be the primary users 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this information in the Limitations Section. Specifically, the commenter suggests that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pilots would be more familiar with the term ``V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' (takeoff decision speed) than with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
MBE
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' (maximum brake energy limit speed). The commenter states that use of V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference is more appropriate than V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
MBE
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this context, as well, since it is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservative with respect to the axle overheat problem. Along this same line, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggests that the AFM wording be revised to indicate that ``the rejected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takeoff conditions should be reported to maintenance personnel prior to the next takeoff'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that ``further dispatch may be affected.'' The FAA concurs with all of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestions and has revised paragraph (c) of the final rule accordingly.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a pilot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were to report a rejected takeoff event to maintenance personnel and refer the V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 speed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved, maintenance personnel can recalculate the V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 figure to a V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
MBE
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 figure by means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a graph incorporated into the AMM.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This commenter also suggests that proposed paragraph (b) be revised to specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the part numbers of the main landing gears (MLG) equipped with the sliding members that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to be replaced. Adding a reference to the MLG part numbers would avoid any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the currently-installed Dowty MLG's and other brands of MLG's that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are expected to be certified and installed in the near future. The FAA concurs with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion and has revised paragraph (b) of the final rule accordingly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 83 airplanes of U.S. registry and 2 U.S. operators will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the rule requires the incorporation of maximum brake wear limits into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program, no other specific additional action, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection, or part replacement costs relative to that requirement are involved; such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions are currently a part of the normal maintenance program. However, it is estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will require 20 work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour, for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator to incorporate the brake wear limitations into its FAA-approved maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,200, or $1,100 per operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 1 work hour per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane to accomplish the required AFM revision, and that the average labor rate is $55 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators is estimated to be $4,565, or $55 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Hamilton Standard 14RF series propellers.
This action adopts new torquing procedures for the propeller hub retaining nuts, requires initial and repetitive
torque checks of propeller hub retaining nuts using those new procedures. In addition, this AD requires repetitive
visual inspections for external propeller oil, investigation, and removal from service of propellers hubs found
cracked or with undetermined leakage. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracks in propeller hubs that initiate
in hub dowel pin holes at the connection of the hub to the engine flange. The actions specified in this AD are intended
to prevent propeller hub cracking and loss of engine oil, and possible loss of a propeller blade or hub.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received reports of cracks found in some Hamilton Standard Model 14RF&hyph;9,
14RF&hyph;19, and 14RF&hyph;21 propeller hubs. Through testing and field investigation the FAA has determined
that insufficient torque of the propeller hub retaining nuts has resulted in damage by fretting within the dowel holes
and subsequent cracks initiating in the hub dowel pin holes at the connection of the hub to the engine flange. The FAA
has also determined that the present torquing procedures for propeller hub retaining nuts on this model propeller
are insufficient to control fretting during the conditions experienced in service. Therefore, through engineering
analysis, the FAA has determined that new, more stringent torquing procedures must be applied to this propeller model
to mitigate this fretting condition. Cracks that may be caused by this condition can be detected by oil leakage not
explained by other conditions such as leaks in the blade seal, the pressure relief valve, or actuator assembly. Since
undetermined oil leakage is a good indication of cracks in the propeller hub, the FAA has also determined that propellers
hubs with unexplained oil leakage must be removed from service and inspected for cracks prior to return to service.
This fretting condition, if not corrected, could result in propeller hub cracking and loss of engine oil, and possible
loss of a propeller blade or hub.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of Temporary Revision (TR) No. 61&hyph;6, dated March 15,
1993, and TR No. 61&hyph;7, dated July 27, 1993, to Hamilton Standard Maintenance Manual (MM) P5186, applicable to
Model 14RF&hyph;9 propellers; TR No. 61&hyph;6, dated April 8, 1993, and TR No. 61&hyph;7, dated July 27, 1993, to
Hamilton Standard MM P5199, applicable to Model 14RF&hyph;19 propellers; and TR No. 61&hyph;4, dated March 15, 1993,
and TR No. 61&hyph;5, dated July 27, 1993, to Hamilton Standard MM P5189, applicable to Model 14RF&hyph;21 propellers.
These TR's describe the new torquing procedures for torque checks of propeller hub retaining nuts, and procedures
for inspecting propeller hubs for cracks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Hamilton Standard 14RF series
propellers of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent propeller hub cracking and loss of engine oil,
and possible loss of a propeller blade or hub. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD requires an initial torque check of the propeller hub retaining nuts within 30 days after the effective date of this
AD, the implementation of a new, more stringent hub retaining nut tightening procedure, and repetitive torque checks
of the hub retaining nuts. If the torque checks of the hub retaining nuts do not meet the acceptance critieria of the
applicable TR's during the initial or subsequent repetitive checks, then the propeller hub must be removed from service
and inspected for cracks prior to return to service. Propeller hubs with crack indications must be removed from service
and replaced with a serviceable propeller hub prior to further flight. The FAA's analysis indicates that 30 days will
be sufficient to schedule the torque checks without adversely affecting flight safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to an acceptable initial torque check and the implementation of the new hub retaining nut tightening procedure,
this AD requires a one-time entry in the propeller maintenance records that the new tightening procedure was incorporated.
In addition, all future propeller installations should follow the new installation and hub retaining nut tightening
procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AD will thereafter require repetitive torque checks at intervals not to exceed 500 hours time in service since
the last inspection. In addition, this AD requires repetitive visual inspections for external propeller oil, investigation,
and removal from service of propellers hubs found cracked or with undetermined leakage. These inspections must be
performed at intervals not to exceed 70 hours time in service (TIS) since the last inspection, or at line checks, whichever
occurs first. If the leakage is found to be caused by other than a leak in the blade seal, the pressure relief valve, or
actuator assembly, the leakage may be due to a propeller hub crack and the propeller must be removed from service and
replaced with a serviceable propeller prior to further flight. The actions would be required to be accomplished in
accordance with the applicable TR's to the MM's described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;09.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 6, 1990 (55 FR 31897), FDA announced that a color additive petition (CAP 0C0224) had been filed by Concept,
Inc., 11311 Concept Blvd., Largo, FL 34643. The petition proposed that the color additive regulations in &sect;74.3602

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
D&amp;C Violet No. 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-caprolactone) absorbable sutures for general surgery. Since the publication of the filing notice, Concept, Inc.,
has changed its name to Linvatec Corp. The petition was filed under section 706 (currently section 721) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 376) (currently 21 U.S.C. 379e).

II. Regulatory History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulatory history of D&amp;C Violet No. 2 is summarized in a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 7, 1990 (55 FR 18865). In the May 1990, final rule FDA permanently listed D&amp;C Violet No. 2 for use in coloring
polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lens haptics (&sect;74.3602) in response to a color additive petition (CAP
9C0216). In that final rule, FDA also transferred the listings for the use of the color additive in sutures from &sect;74.1602
(21 CFR 74.1602) under Subpart B_Drugs to &sect;74.3602 under Subpart D_Medical Devices. Since the publication
of the May 7, 1990, final rule, &sect;74.3602 has been amended to provide for the safe use of D&amp;C Violet No. 2 as a
color additive in poliglecaprone 25 (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Applicability of the Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the passage of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94&hyph;295), Congress mandated the listing of
color additives for use in medical devices when the color additive in the device comes into direct contact with the
body for a significant period of time (21 U.S.C. 379e(a)). D&amp;C Violet No. 2 is added to the poly(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-caprolactone) absorbable sutures in such a way that at least some of the color additive will come into contact with
the body when the sutures are in place. In addition, the sutures are intended to be absorbed by the body, and during the
absorption, the color additive will be deposited in body tissue. Thus, the color additive will be in direct contact
with the body for a significant period of time. Consequently, the use of the color additive currently before the agency
is subject to the statutory listing requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. The Color Additive
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
D&amp;C Violet No. 2 is principally 1-hydroxy-4-[(4-methylphenyl)amino]-9,10-anthracenedione (CAS Reg. No.
81&hyph;48&hyph;1). It is manufactured by either condensation of quinizarin with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine or by condensation of 1-hydroxy-halogenoanthroquinone with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine. Because no chemical
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->
reaction consumes all the starting materials and yields only the desired product, both the resulting reaction mixture
and commercial product will contain residual amounts of the starting materials, including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine. This fact is significant because Weisburger et al. have demonstrated that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine is a carcinogen in mice (Ref. 1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Residual amounts of reactants, such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine and other manufacturing aids, are commonly found among the impurities of many color additives. The presence
of such impurities is not unique to color additives. Numerous minor impurities are present in all chemical products,
even in highly purified reagent-grade chemicals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Determination of Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 721(b)(4) of the act (21 U.S.C. 379e(b)(4)), the so-called ``general safety clause'' for color additives,
a color additive cannot be listed for a particular use unless a fair evaluation of the data and information available
to FDA establish that the color additive is safe for that use. FDA's color additive regulations (21 CFR 70.3(i)) define
``safe'' as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under
the intended conditions of use.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The anticancer or Delaney clause of the Color Additive Amendments (section 721(b)(5)(B) of the act) provides that
a noningested color additive shall be deemed unsafe and shall not be listed if, after tests that are appropriate for
evaluating the safety of the additive for such use, it is found to induce cancer in man or animal. Importantly, however,
the Delaney clause applies to the additive itself and not to constituents of the additive. That is, where an additive
itself has not been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated
under the general safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty
that no harm will result from the proposed use of the additive,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Safety of the Petitioned Use of the Additive
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA estimates that the upper limit of lifetime exposure to D&amp;C Violet No. 2 from its use in coloring poly(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-caprolactone) absorbable sutures is 3.7 milligrams (mg) per person (0.15 micrograms (&mu;g) per person per day).
The agency calculated this upper limit of lifetime exposure based on several factors. First, the color additive will
be used at a level of 0.1 percent by weight of the poly(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-caprolactone) absorbable sutures. Second, the agency made four assumptions: (1) Five meters is the maximum total
length of suture likely to be used in a single surgical operation, and 10 meters of suture would be used in multiple operations
over a person's lifetime; (2) a lifespan of 70 years follows initial suture implantation; (3) a size 2 suture is used
for general surgery; and (4) 100 percent of the color additive migrates from the suture into the body. Because these
are conservative assumptions, the lifetime exposure to D&amp;C Violet No. 2 from its use in coloring poly(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-caprolactone) absorbable sutures is likely to be far less than 3.7 mg per person (0.15 &mu;g per person per day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive
whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing in this case.
Although the agency does not normally require such testing, chronic studies supporting current listings for the
use of D&amp;C Violet No. 2 are available in the agency's files, and FDA's safety evaluation of the proposed use of the
color additive in absorbable sutures included a consideration of these studies. Two-year carcinogenicity studies
of dyed sutures implanted in rats and a lifetime skin-painting study in mice showed no indication of carcinogenicity.
Additionally, teratology studies of sutures implanted in rats and rabbits exhibited no evidence of teratogenic
effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its evaluation of the safety of the proposed use of the subject additive, FDA has also considered other safety data
submitted previously to support current listings for the use of D&amp;C Violet No. 2. These toxicity studies of D&amp;C
Violet No. 2 included acute oral toxicity studies in rats and dogs, acute toxicity studies of dyed sutures and suture
components in rats and mice, an evaluation of the tissue response to dyed sutures implanted intramuscularly in rats,
a biological evaluation of dyed sutures implanted in rabbit's eyes, a study of the tissue reaction to the color additive
injected into rabbit muscle, in vitro cytotoxicity studies, a pyrogenicity study of sutures, 7-month toxicity studies
of implanted sutures in rats and dogs, a 119-day evaluation of dyed sutures implanted intramuscularly in rats, and
six mutagenicity studies, including one 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
/reverse mutation test (Ames test) using extracts of dyed sutures, one study of chromosomal aberrations using dyed
suture in Chinese hamster ovary cells, one study of in vitro transformation using dyed suture in Balb/c-3T3 cells,
two mouse lymphoma forward mutation assays using dyed suture, and one mouse lymphoma toxicity assay of dyed suture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA evaluated the toxicity studies that the petitioner provided to support the proposed use of D&amp;C
Violet No. 2 in poly(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-caprolactone) absorbable sutures for general surgery. These studies included a hemolysis test by direct contact,
a direct contact cytotoxicity test on mouse fibroblast cells using extracts of dyed sutures, a systemic toxicity
test in mice using extracts of dyed sutures, a guinea pig sensitization maximization test using extracts of dyed sutures,
a test of intracutaneous toxicity in rabbits using extracts of dyed sutures, implantation tests (7, 32, and 89 days,
and 6 and 9 months) in rabbits, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
/mammalian mutagenicity test using extracts of dyed sutures, 52- and 32-week implantation tests in rats, and 60-
and 62-day evaluations of absorbable suture following abdominal wound closure in rabbits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no significant adverse effects from D&amp;C Violet No. 2 in any of the studies evaluated by the agency. Therefore,
the agency has concluded that these studies in conjunction with previously submitted studies establish the safety
of the proposed use of D&amp;C Violet No. 2 as a color additive in poly(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-caprolactone) absorbable sutures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data. The
agency has also used risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limit of risk presented by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine, a carcinogenic chemical that may be present as an impurity in the additive. The risk evaluation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of the additive and
(2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposure to humans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-caprolactone) absorbable sutures colored with D&amp;C Violet No. 2 that complies with the applicable specifications
is 0.3 nanograms (ng) per person per day. The agency used data reported by the National Cancer Institute, which demonstrated
that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine was carcinogenic for male and female Charles River CD-1 (HaM/ICR derived) mice, causing an increased
incidence of hepatomas (liver tumors) (Ref. 1), to estimate the upper-bound limit of lifetime human risk from exposure
to this chemical stemming from the proposed use of D&amp;C Violet No. 2 as a color additive in poly(

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-caprolactone) absorbable sutures (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a potential exposure of 0.3 ng per person per day, the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from the
potential exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine from the proposed use of D&amp;C Violet No. 2 as a color additive in poly(

-11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or 2 in 100 billion (Ref. 3). Because of the numerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate, actual lifetime-averaged
individual exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine is expected to be substantially less than the worst-case estimated daily exposure. Therefore, the actual
risk would be less than 2x10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from exposure to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Specifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
D&amp;C Violet No. 2 is currently produced as a certifiable color additive for use in externally applied drugs and
cosmetics, in sutures, and in contact lenses in accordance with 21 CFR part 80. Based upon the low level of exposure
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine that results under the current specifications for D&amp;C Violet No. 2 in &sect;74.1602, the agency concludes
that the specifications listed in &sect;74.1602 are adequate to ensure the safe use of this color additive and to control
the amount of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine that may exist as an impurity in the color additive when used in poly(

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the available toxicity data and the other relevant considerations discussed above, FDA concludes that
there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the petitioned use of D&amp;C Violet No. 2 for coloring
poly(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-caprolactone) absorbable sutures when it is used at a level not to exceed 0.1 percent by weight of the suture material.
The agency also concludes on the basis of available data that the color additive will perform its intended coloring
effect in poly(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-caprolactone) absorbable sutures and, thus, is suitable for this use. The agency, therefore, is amending &sect;74.3602
of the color additive regulations to provide for use of the color additive at a maximum level of 0.1 percent by weight
in poly(

Under section 328(a)(3) of the Act, EPA may delegate authority to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations to
a state if that state is adjacent to an OCS source and the Administrator determines that the state's regulations are
adequate. The State of California is adjacent to a number of OCS sources. For the OCS sources for which Santa Barbara
County has been designated the corresponding onshore area (COA), the State has submitted SBCAPCD's regulations
to EPA and requested that EPA delegate authority to SBCAPCD to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations. SBCAPCD's
regulations have been reviewed by EPA and determined to be adequate for implementing and enforcing the delegable
sections of 40 CFR part 55. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCS air regulations set forth the following criteria for delegation at 40 CFR 55.11: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA is delegating to the District. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The state has adequate authority under state law to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55_According
to a letter dated January 25, 1993 and forwarded to EPA from the State Attorney General, SBCAPCD has the authority to
implement and enforce the requirements of part 55. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The state has adequate resources to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55_SBCAPCD has submitted information
documenting that the District has adequate resources to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55.

EPA to SLOCAPCD to implement and enforce the requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations (``OCS'')
(40 CFR part 55) within 25 miles of the state's seaward boundary, pursuant to section 328(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act
(``the Act''), subject to the terms and conditions below. EPA has reviewed SLOCAPCD's request for delegation and
has found that SLOCAPCD's regulations meet the requirements for delegation set forth at 40 CFR 55.11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA is not delegating the authority to implement and enforce &sect;&sect;55.5 (Corresponding onshore area designation),
55.11 (Delegation), and 55.12 (Consistency updates), as authority for these sections is reserved to the Administrator.
In addition, SLOCAPCD does not have SIP-approved Prevention of Significant Deterioration (``PSD'') regulations,
nor has it received delegation of authority from EPA for implementation and enforcement of the federal PSD program.
Therefore, EPA shall retain authority for the PSD provisions of part C of the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder
at 40 CFR 52.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 328(a)(3) of the Act, EPA may delegate authority to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations to
a state if that state is adjacent to an OCS source and the Administrator determines that the state's regulations are
adequate. The State of California is adjacent to a number of OCS sources. For the OCS sources for which the San Luis Obispo
County has been designated the corresponding onshore area (COA), the State has submitted SLOCAPCD's regulations
to EPA and requested that EPA delegate to SLOCAPCD authority to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations. SLOCAPCD's
regulations have been reviewed by EPA and determined to be adequate for implementing and enforcing the delegable
sections of 40 CFR part 55. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCS air regulations set forth the following criteria for delegation at 40 CFR 55.11: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The state has adopted the appropriate portions of 40 CFR part 55 into state law_SLOCAPCD adopted Rule 215, Outer
Continental Shelf Air Regulations, on November 17, 1992. This rule incorporates the provisions of 40 CFR part 55 that
EPA is delegating to the District. (NOTE: Section 55.5, corresponding onshore area designations, was adopted by
SLOCAPCD but EPA will not delegate authority for this section, as provided by &sect;55.11(a)).

to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The state has adequate resources to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55_SLOCAPCD has submitted

(1) SLOCAPCD shall implement and enforce the Federal requirements of 40 CFR 55.13 as well as the applicable state and
local requirements contained in 40 CFR 55.14. Notwithstanding the above, EPA retains authority for implementation
and enforcement of the PSD requirements of part C of the Act and 40 CFR 52.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The primary responsibility for enforcement of the OCS air regulations delegated to the District shall rest with

the OCS regulations, or the terms and conditions of any permit issued by the District pursuant to this agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the event that the District is unwilling or unable to enforce a provision of this delegation with respect to a
source subject to the OCS air regulations, the District will immediately notify the EPA Region 9 Regional Administrator.
Failure to notify the Regional Administrator does not preclude EPA from exercising its enforcement authority.

(6) If SLOCAPCD adopts revisions to the District regulations reviewed by EPA and found to meet the requirements set
forth at 40 CFR 55.11 for delegation, the parties may amend the agreement pursuant to condition 5 above, or EPA may take
steps to revoke the delegation in whole or in part pursuant to condition 7 below. Any amendments to regulations submitted
by the District to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 55.11 shall not be applied under this agreement until EPA has reviewed
such amendments and determined that they are still adequate to implement and enforce the delegable portions of 40
CFR part 55. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) This delegation, after consultation with the SLOCAPCD, may be revoked in whole or in part if the U.S. EPA determines
that the SLOCAPCD no longer meets the requirements for delegation set forth at 40 CFR 55.11(b)(1&hyph;4). Any such
revocation shall be effective as of the date specified in a Notice of Revocation to the SLOCAPCD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The undersigned, on behalf of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (``VCAPCD'' or ``the District'')
and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''), hereby agree to the delegation of authority from
EPA to VCAPCD to implement and enforce the requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations (``OCS'')
(40 CFR part 55) within 25 miles of the state's seaward boundary, pursuant to section 328(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act
(``the Act''), subject to the terms and conditions below. EPA has reviewed VCAPCD's request for delegation and has
found that VCAPCD's regulations meet the requirements for delegation set forth at 40 CFR 55.11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA is not delegating the authority to implement and enforce &sect;&sect;55.5 (Corresponding onshore area designation),
55.11 (Delegation), and 55.12 (Consistency updates), as authority for these sections is reserved to the Administrator.
In addition, VCAPCD does not have SIP-approved PSD regulations, nor has it received delegation of authority from
EPA for implementation and enforcement of the federal PSD program. Therefore, EPA shall retain authority for the
PSD provisions of part C of the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder at 40 CFR 52.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 328(a)(3) of the Act, EPA may delegate authority to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations to
a state if that state is adjacent to an OCS source and the Administrator determines that the state's regulations are
adequate. The State of California is adjacent to a number of OCS sources. For the OCS sources for which the Ventura County
APCD has been designated the corresponding onshore area (COA), the State has submitted VCAPCD's regulations to EPA
and requested that EPA delegate authority to VCAPCD to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations. VCAPCD's regulations
have been reviewed by EPA and determined to be adequate for implementing and enforcing the delegable sections of 40
CFR part 55. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCS regulations set forth the following criteria for delegation at 40 CFR 55.11: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The state has adopted the appropriate portions of 40 CFR part 55 into state law_VCAPCD adopted Rule 72.1, Outer
Continental Shelf Air Regulations, on December 22, 1992. This rule incorporates the provisions of 40 CFR Part 55 that
EPA is delegating to the District. (NOTE: Section 55.5, corresponding onshore area designations, was adopted by
VCAPCD but EPA will not delegate authority for this section, as provided by &sect;55.11(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The state has adequate authority under state law to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55_According
to the State Attorney General's January 12, 1993 letter which was forwarded to EPA, VCAPCD has the authority to implement
and enforce the requirements of part 55. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The state has adequate resources to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55_VCAPCD has submitted information
documenting that the District has adequate resources to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The state has adequate administrative procedures to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55, including
public notice and comment procedures_VCAPCD's administrative procedures have been reviewed by EPA and found to
be adequate. The following rules were submitted by VCAPCD for review to meet this requirement:

EPA maintains that the District may use any administrative Procedures it has under State law to implement and enforce
the requirements of part 55, such as a variance. However, as stated in the preamble to part 55, as onshore, a variance
will not shield a source from enforcement action by EPA.

and shall make available to the Administrator any materials used in making the determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) VCAPCD shall provide written notice of any permit application from a source, the emissions from which may affect
a Class I area, to the Federal Land Manager of that area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The District will request EPA guidance on any matter involving the interpretation of section 328 of the Act, the
delegated sections of the OCS air regulations or any other provision of 40 CFR part 55 to the extent that implementation,
review, administration or enforcement of these provisions has not been covered by determinations or guidance sent
to the District. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act, EPA may review permits issued by the District under this agreement

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(3) In the event that the District is unwilling or unable to enforce a provision of this delegation with respect to a
source subject to the OCS air regulations, the District will immediately notify the EPA Region 9 Regional Administrator.
Failure to notify the Regional Administrator does not preclude EPA from exercising its enforcement authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Since the communities on the attached list have recently entered the NFIP, subsidized flood
insurance is now available for property in the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas
in some of these communities by publishing a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The
date of the flood map, if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. In the communities listed
where a flood map has been published, Section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
4012(a), requires the purchase of flood insurance as a condition of Federal or federally related financial assistance
for acquisition or construction of buildings in the special flood hazard areas shown on the map. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director finds that the delayed effective dates would be contrary to the public interest. The Director also finds
that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary.

The Associate Director certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the rule creates no additional burden, but lists those communities eligible for the sale

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 8090 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;139) prohibits use of Fiscal Year
1994 appropriated funds for acquisition of aircraft fuel cells unless such cells are manufactured in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Defense Procurement, issued Departmental Letter 94&hyph;003, March 7, 1994, to implement the restriction
on acquisition of aircraft fuel cells in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act applies but is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities because the revisions are limited to acquisition of aircraft fuel cells, and limit such acquisitions
to U.S. manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the revisions in this rulemaking notice do not contain 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->

A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue this rule as an interim rule.
Urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule before affording the public an opportunity to comment.
This action is necessary because section 8090 became effective upon enactment of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations
Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;139), on November 11, 1993. However, pursuant to Public Law 98&hyph;577 and Federal Acquisition
Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response to this interim rule will be considered in formulating the
final rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS amends the regulations governing the harvesting of Antarctic marine living resources and/or other associated
activities by persons subject to jurisdiction of the United States by adding regulations for the protection of land-based
ecosystem monitoring sites designated within Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Living Marine Resources
(CCAMLR) waters. The regulations implement conservation and management measures promulgated by the Commission
for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (Commission) and accepted in whole by the Government of
the United States to regulate activities within Convention waters. The Commission, at its ninth meeting in 1990,
established a procedure for protecting sites within the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP). Long-term
investigations of selected sites within CEMP will be conducted to monitor changes in the ecosystem. The Commission
determined that these sites are in need of the status of ``Specially Protected Sites'' similar to the program established
under the Antarctic Treaty. The intent of these regulations is to implement the agreed to procedures for CEMP.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At its ninth annual meeting in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, in 1990, the Commission, of which the United States is
a member, adopted detailed procedures for according protection to sites within the CEMP. This protection, extended
pursuant to site-specific management plans, is intended to prevent adverse impacts to these sites resulting from
certain forms of human activities. Once approved, management plans will be reviewed every 5 years to determine whether
they require revision and whether continued protection is necessary. Section 307 of the Antarctic Living Marine
Resources Convention Act of 1984 (the Act) states that the Secretary of Commerce, after consultation with the heads
of appropriate agencies, shall promulgate such regulations as are necessary to implement the provisions of the Act
and the Conservation Measures adopted by the Commission. This notice adds regulatory text for previously reserved
&sect;380.28 of 50 CFR part 380 to implement CEMP procedures and the Commission's approved CEMP management plans.
One part of the section requires individuals seeking permits in order to enter a CEMP site to apply either to NMFS or
the National Science Foundation (NSF) as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. If the CEMP protected site is not also a site specially protected under the Antarctic Treaty, or the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the individual must apply to NMFS for a CEMP entry permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. If the CEMP protected site is also a site specially protected under the Antarctic Treaty or the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, and, thus, a site requiring a permit under the Antarctic Conservation Act (ACA)
(and any superseding legislation), the individual must apply to NSF for a single CEMP/ACA permit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Classification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of Commerce has determined that this rule is necessary to implement the Act and to give effect to the conservation
and management measures adopted by the Commission and agreed to by the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The collection
of information has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Approval Number 0648&hyph;0194). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1 hour per application, and
one half hour for preparation of a final report on the permitted activities. All reporting burden estimates include
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Thomas J. McIntyre,
National Marine Fisheries Service, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget (see

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 22, 1993, the Postal Service published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 49402&hyph;49415) to require that the residual portion of second- and third-class letter-size automation
rate mailings be sorted to the automated area distribution center (AADC) level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the proposed rule, this change was needed to correct the processing problem that resulted when the
requirement for a states and mixed-states presort of second- and third-class residual mail was eliminated as part
of a larger change in preparation requirements that took effect March 21, 1993. At the time, the Postal Service did
not anticipate the magnitude of the resulting increase in residual mail that must be processed at origin. This increase
in non-presorted residual mail has exceeded the Postal Service's processing capabilities at many facilities, leading
to considerable problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also introduced an additional preparation option for the residual portion of First-Class letter-size
automation rate mailings and changed the tray labeling requirement for Line 2 of AADC trays of letter-size mail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is intended to address the specific processing problem discussed in the proposed rule. As part of the
ongoing process of re-examining the mailing standards in the DMM, the Postal Service plans to take a more comprehensive
look at the standards for automation rate mail later this year, with a view to simplifying those standards.

Evaluation of Comments Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Postal Service received eight comments on the proposed rule, including five from mailing-related businesses,
two from companies or corporations, and one from an individual. These comments are discussed below.

Package Size

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters raised concerns relative to the preparation and processing of small packages. The original proposal
did not contain a minimum package size for presortation of the residual portion of the mailing. Instead, it stated
that residual packages must be prepared if two or more pieces in a mailing destinate to an AADC area. The commenters
claimed that the creation of such small packages was burdensome to mailers and inefficient for the Postal Service.
One mailer also stated that banding small packages results in damage to the mailpieces that may render them unsuitable
for automated processing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Postal Service shares the commenters' concerns about package size. After consideration of the comments received,
a decision was reached to require packaging of residual pieces only if 10 or more pieces destinate to an AADC area. The
10-piece minimum (which was formerly the minimum for state packages) balances concerns about extremely small packages
against the Postal Service's need to reduce piece handlings of residual mail at origin. Residual pieces not meeting
the 10-piece package minimum are to be placed in a working tray in AADC sequence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Processing Efficiency of Packages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments were received concerning the relative efficiency of processing residual AADC packages instead of
full, unpackaged residual trays. The commenters suggested that the costs associated with unbanding residual packages
prior to processing on automated equipment may outweigh any benefits the Postal Service receives through presorting.
These mailers stated that mail in full trays is more suitable for induction into high-speed automated equipment than
is mail in bundles. The commenters argued that the Postal Service might actually realize increased processing costs
for the residual portion of mailings as a result of the proposed preparation changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service has determined that presortation of the residual portion of a mailing will improve overall operating
efficiency for the Postal Service relative to nonpresorted residual trays. Mixed-AADC trays will contain AADC packages
that must be distributed at origin. However, no piece processing will be performed on this mail at the origin facility.
Piece processing of residual mail at origin will be limited to working trays containing pieces that do not meet the
10-piece minimum to an AADC area. Thus, presortation of residual mail will virtually eliminate piece processing
of this mail at the origin facility. Although there is some cost to handle packages, the Postal Service has concluded
that this cost is outweighed by the need to correct the processing problems currently presented by piece handling
of residual mail, as described in the proposed rule. Moreover, a significant proportion of the packages will not be
handled at origin; for example, all residual mail in AADC trays will be routed directly to destination. Also, the new
requirements allow for the creation of full AADC trays of residual mail that is not packaged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional Mailer Operating Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five commenters stated that the proposed changes would increase their operating costs. Two of these mailers remarked
that the Postal Service is essentially transferring costs from mail processing plants to mailer plants. Two of the
commenters expressed concerns about the costs of training their workers on the new requirements. One mailer commented
that the proposed changes were incompatible with his operation and would require substantial and costly changes
to his production processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The residual preparation requirements in this rule are comparable to those in effect prior to March 21, 1993, for automated
rate second- and third-class letters prepared in sacks, and those still in effect for nonautomated presort second-
and third-class letters. Prior to the March 21, 1993, change, mailers were required to prepare packages of residual
second- and third-class automated rate letters and place them in state and mixed-states sacks. State sacks were then
routed to a destination SDC for processing while mixed-states sacks were, in most cases, processed at the origin SCF.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule will require similar presortation of the residual portion of second- and third-class automated rate letter
mailings. Like state packages and sacks, residual AADC packages and trays involve presortation of the residual portion
of a mailing in order to bypass outgoing processing operations at the origin facility. Only mail in working trays will
be processed at the origin SCF, as was mixed-states mail under the previous preparation requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring this presortation of the residual portion of a second- or third-class mailing is justified by the fact that
some degree of worksharing is assumed in the basic rate paid for second- and third-class residual letters, a rate that
is substantially reduced from the single-piece rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter expressed concern about being required to prepare a large number of less-than-full residual AADC trays,
which would be a waste of time and space. This final rule, which permits AADC packages of 10 or more pieces to be placed
in a mixed-AADC tray if a full AADC tray cannot be prepared, and allows groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC to be placed
in working trays, avoids the potential problem raised by this commenter.

Creation of Nonuniform Preparation Standards for Different Classes of Automated Mail

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the proposed changes represented a retreat from the Postal Service's declared goal of simplified
and standardized mail preparation requirements. This mailer remarked that adopting the proposed changes would
necessitate the retraining of his workforce and lead to verification problems for the Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the changes in this rule will make the required preparation of the residual portion of second- and third-class
automated rate letters different from that for First-Class Mail, the Postal Service believes these changes are appropriate
given the processing problems that led to the proposed rule and the discount mailers receive for basic rate mail in
second- and third-class mailings. Furthermore, the final regulations are modified to allow First-Class mailers
the option of preparing residual mail according to the residual sortation options required for second- and third-class
mail. This modification will allow mailers the opportunity to presort first-, second-, and third-class mailings
in a uniform manner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter recommended that the Postal Service reduce or eliminate the 50-piece minimum for qualifying 3-digit
mail as a way to reduce the residual volume. This mailer proposed that the Postal Service eliminate the 3-digit qualifying
minimum for automated mail if it is prepared in trays on SCF pallets and reduce the minimum to 10 pieces for mail that
is 100 percent delivery point barcoded. The result, according to this mailer, would be a significant reduction in
the amount of residual mail requiring processing at the origin plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relaxation of the 50-piece minimum for qualifying 3-digit mail under package-based preparation is not being considered
at the present time. Under tray-based preparation options, second- and third-class mail in SCF trays is not required
to meet a 50-piece minimum for a 3-digit area. However, this rule gives mailers an option to prepare the residual portion
of package-based mailings by 3-digit area with no minimum package size.

Limit Residual Preparation to Full AADC Trays

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that the Postal Service test the feasibility of limiting the preparation of residual mail
to full AADC trays. Residual mail that remained after full AADC trays were prepared would not require sortation. The
commenter contended that this limited approach might solve the processing problems caused by residual mail volumes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limiting residual preparation to full AADC trays would not adequately address the problem of excessive volumes of
working residual mail at origin. Most AADC areas contain five or fewer 3-digit ZIP Code areas, making it very unlikely
that full trays of residual mail could be prepared for these AADCs given that 3-digit packages must be prepared at 50
pieces. In order to relieve the problems associated with processing residual mail at origin, a more substantial presortation
of the residual portion of a mailing than that suggested by this commenter is necessary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that each of the 10 processing and distribution areas set up a centralized facility for processing
residual mail. Under this scenario, origin processing plants would divert the residual portion of automation rate
mailings to this centralized site for processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equipment deployment decisions are based on originating and destinating volumes for all classes of mail within a
processing and distribution plant's service area. Allocating equipment based on originating residual volumes
of second- and third-class letters would result in sub-optimal utilization of automated equipment. The Postal Service
believes that presortation of residual volumes, as described in this rule, is a reasonable and effective way to deal
with the processing problems caused by piece processing of residual mail.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule will require presortation of the residual portion of second- and third-class mailings by AADC area. These
changes are optional for First-Class mailings. Changes in residual preparation are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Full AADC trays must be prepared if enough pieces exist to fill a tray. Packaging is not required in full AADC
trays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;AADC packages must be prepared if 10 or more residual pieces destinate to an AADC area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Less-than-full AADC trays are not permitted except for optional overflow trays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;AADC packages of 10 or more pieces not placed in a full AADC tray must be banded, labeled, and placed in a mixed-AADC
tray. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;AADC packages must bear a pink Label A or optional endorsement line (OEL).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;AADC packages must be banded, except when placed in full AADC trays. Separator cards are not allowed in overflow
AADC trays or in mixed-AADC trays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Mail remaining after preparing AADC packages must be placed in working trays in AADC sequence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
ZIP+4 Presort and Barcoded Package-Based Mailings (DMM M813, M815, and M816) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule will require that the residual portion of second- and third-class package-based mailings be prepared under
one of the two options described below. Both options require presortation of residual pieces by AADC area. First-Class
mailings may be prepared under either of these options, which together will replace the current AADC tray option,
or under the existing ZIP Code sequencing and listing option or the physical separation option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
SCF/AADC Preparation Option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this option, the residual and qualifying portions of the mailing may be combined in SCF and AADC trays. Residual
pieces must be sorted into AADC packages if 10 or more pieces destinate to an AADC area. All pieces that do not meet the
10-piece minimum are placed in working trays. In addition, mailers have the option of preparing residual mail into
3-digit packages prior to preparing required AADC packages. Three-digit residual packages must be labeled (green
Label 3 or OEL or separator card label) and placed in SCF trays. AADC packages must be packaged and labeled (pink Label
A or OEL) and placed in AADC trays and mixed-AADC trays, except that pieces in full AADC trays containing only residual
mail need not be packaged and labeled. AADC trays must be prepared if enough pieces exist to fill a tray. Less-than-full
AADC trays are permitted. Mixed-AADC trays must be prepared unless all residual mail is trayed to the AADC level. Mixed-AADC
trays are limited to AADC packages of residual mail. Pieces remaining after preparing and traying AADC packages are
working mail and must be placed in working trays in AADC sequence. In barcoded three-tier package-based mailings
prepared under M816, residual mail is not permitted in the 5-digit tier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Separate AADC Sortation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this option, the residual portion of the mailing is presented separately from the qualifying portion in AADC,
mixed-AADC, and working trays. AADC packages must be prepared if 10 or more pieces destinate to an AADC area, except
that pieces in full AADC trays need not be packaged. AADC trays must be prepared if enough pieces exist to fill a tray.
Less-than-full AADC trays are permitted. Remaining AADC packages must be placed in mixed-AADC trays. AADC packages
must be labeled with a pink Label A or OEL. All pieces that do not meet the 10-piece minimum per AADC are placed in separate
working trays in AADC sequence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Labeling Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AADC tray label for two-tier package-based preparation under DMM M815 is revised to change the position of the
term ``LTRS'' on the second line so that it is consistent with other tray labels. The AADC tray label for 3-tier package-based
preparation under DMM M816 is revised to delete the term ``3D'' when SCF/AADC residual preparation is used. Since
these trays will contain both 3-digit and AADC packages, the description ``3D'' is no longer appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the labeling format for mixed-AADC and working trays is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;ZIP+4 mixed-AADC trays: On Line 1 use ``MXD'' followed by the applicable origin SCF name, state, and ZIP Code
from L002, Column A (facilities identified with three bullets), or Column B, except use L805 for second- and third-class
mail entered by the mailer at a BMC/ASF. On Line 2 use class followed by ZIP+4 PRESORT PKGS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;ZIP+4 working trays: On Line 1 use ``MXD'' followed by the applicable origin SCF name, state, and ZIP Code from
L002, Column A (facilities identified with three bullets), or Column B, except use L805 for second- and third-class
mail entered by the mailer at a BMC/ASF. On Line 2 use class followed by ZIP+4 WORKING or ZIP+4 WKG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Barcoded mixed-AADC trays: On Line 1 use ``MXD'' followed by the applicable origin SCF name, state, and ZIP
Code from L002, Column A (facilities identified with three bullets), or Column B, except use L805 for second- and third-class
mail entered by the mailer at a BMC/ASF. On Line 2 use class followed by LTRS BARCODED PKGS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

at the DBMC rate, and the facility to which the sacks, trays, or pallets are labeled is within the DBMC service area,
except that, machinable parcels claimed at the DBMC rate and deposited at the corresponding facility may be placed
in the same sack or on the same pallet as other correctly presorted machinable parcels not eligible for or not claimed
at the DBMC rate.

a. Separate AADC Preparation. Residual mail is trayed separately from qualifying mail. Groups of 10 or more residual
pieces to an AADC area in L804 (or L803 or automated site preparation) are placed in AADC trays and mixed-AADC trays.
AADC trays are required if there are enough pieces to fill a tray, but less-than-full AADC trays are permitted. Residual
pieces in mixed-AADC trays and in less-than-full AADC trays must be prepared and labeled as AADC packages. Remaining
groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC are placed in separate working trays. Packages and trays must be prepared under
5.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Intermixed SCF/AADC Preparation. Some residual mail is trayed with qualifying mail. Groups of 10 or more residual
pieces to the same AADC area in L804 (or L803 for automated site preparation) are packaged by AADC and placed in AADC
trays (with qualifying mail) and in mixed-AADC trays. AADC trays are required if there are enough pieces to fill a tray,
but less-than-full AADC trays are permitted. AADC trays containing only residual AADC packages are allowed. Mixed-AADC
trays are limited to residual AADC packages. At the mailer's option, residual mail may be packaged by 3-digit ZIP Code
and placed in SCF trays (remaining pieces sorted by AADC). A less-than-full tray for the origin SCF containing only
residual packages is allowed. Remaining groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC are placed in separate working trays.
Packages and trays must be prepared under 5.3. First-Class automated site mailings in which the residual portion

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Documentation must meet the basic standards in P012 and those below. Residual mail is included in the documentation
if prepared under 6.2 and 6.3, or 6.4, or in the summary alone if prepared under 6.5. Abbreviated documentation may
be provided under M817. Combined mailings of second-class publications must be documented under E238.

7.4&blank;Segmentation, Labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Documentation must be segmented and labeled by qualification tier (e.g., presort and residual). A residual segment
is not required for First-Class Mail if separated under 6.5. Each tier must be further segmented by type of package/grouping
(5-digit, 3-digit, AADC, as applicable) under 7.5, or have all represented 3- and 5-digit ZIP Codes (and AADC codes
for residual mail under 6.2 and 6.3) reported in a continuous sequential list under 7.6 within each tier listing. Under
either option, data must be presented as shown in 7.7 and 7.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

7.5&blank;Type of Package Option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If the report is segmented by type of package, for each type, individual entries for each destination must be ordered
sequentially by ZIP Code: by 5-digit ZIP Code for 5-digit packages; by lowest assigned 5-digit ZIP Code for city packages
(second-class only); by 3-digit ZIP Code for 3-digit packages and First-Class residual mail prepared under 6.4;
and, for AADC packages and AADC groups (in working trays) by the applicable 3-digit AADC code in L804 (AADC entries
must be preceded by ``AADC''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
7.6&blank;Sequential List Option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If the report is a sequential list, individual entries for each destination must be ordered sequentially by ZIP Code
within each qualification tier, regardless of package type: by 5-digit ZIP Code for 5-digit packages; by lowest assigned
5-digit ZIP Code for city packages (second-class only); by 3-digit ZIP Code for 3-digit packages and First-Class
residual mail prepared under 6.5; and, for AADC packages and AADC groups (in working trays) under 6.2 and 6.3, by the
applicable 3-digit AADC code in L804 (AADC entries must be preceded by ``AADC''). For second-class only, listings
for 5-digit, city, and 3-digit packages must be preceded by the prefixes 5DG, CTY, and 3DG, respectively.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. This proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require inspections to detect cracking in the upper row of fasteners in the lower lobe of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fuselage skin lap joints, and repair, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of incidents involving fatigue cracking and corrosion in transport category airplanes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are approaching or have exceeded their design life goal. The actions specified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the fuselage skin and rapid loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure in the airplane. This proposal also relates to the recommendations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airworthiness Assurance Task Force assigned to review Model 747 series airplanes, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate that, to assure long term continued operational safety, various structural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections should be accomplished.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In April 1988, a transport category airplane managed to land after cracks in rivet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holes in the upper fuselage linked together, causing structural failure and uncontrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decompression. An 18-foot section ripped from the fuselage. This accident focused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater attention on the problem of aging aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1988, the FAA sponsored a conference on aging airplane issues, which was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attended by representatives of the aviation industry from around the world. It became 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obvious that, because of the tremendous increase in air travel, the relatively slow pace of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new airplane production, and the apparent economic feasibility of operating older 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology airplanes rather than retiring them, increased attention needed to be focused on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this aging fleet and maintaining its continued operational safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America and the Aerospace Industries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association (AIA) of America committed to identifying and implementing procedures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure continuing structural airworthiness of aging transport category airplanes. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airworthiness Assurance Task Force, with representatives from the aircraft operators, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, regulatory authorities, and other aviation representatives, was established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in August 1988. The objective of the Task Force was to sponsor ``Working Groups'' to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Select service bulletins, applicable to each airplane model in the transport fleet, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be recommended for mandatory modification of aging airplanes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Develop corrosion directed inspections and prevention programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Review the adequacy of each operator's structural maintenance program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Working Group assigned to review the Boeing Model 747 series airplanes completed its work on Item 2 in July 1989
and developed a baseline program for controlling corrosion problems that may jeopardize the continued airworthiness
of the Boeing Model 747 fleet. This program is contained in Boeing Document Number D6&hyph;36022, ``Aging Airplane
Corrosion Prevention and Control Program_Model 747,'' dated July 1989. The FAA issued AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05, Amendment
39&hyph;6790 (55 FR 49268, November 27, 1990), which requires implementation of a corrosion prevention and control
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group completed a portion of its work on Item 1, above. The Working Group's proposal is contained in Boeing
Document Number D6&hyph;35999, ``Aging Airplane Service Bulletin Structural Modification Program_Model 747.''
The FAA issued AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;6490 (55 FR 8374, March 7, 1990), which requires the installation
of the structural modifications identified in the Boeing Document, and AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;8437
(58 FR 8693, February 17, 1993), which requires structural inspections of older airplanes.

Additional structural inspections are required by AD 86&hyph;09&hyph;07 R1, Amendment 39&hyph;5580 (52 FR 7564,
March 12, 1987), which references Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2267, dated March 28, 1986, and Revision
1, dated September 25, 1986.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The action being proposed herein follows from the ongoing activities of the Working Group relative to Item 1. The Working
Group has identified certain service difficulties that warrant mandatory inspections following mandatory modification
of these airplanes. The Working Group considers that these service difficulties can be controlled safely by repetitively
inspecting following modification of these airplanes, and that, because of the safety implications, the inspections
should be mandatory to assure that all operators perform them. Typically, the addressed unsafe conditions have occurred
infrequently on older airplanes, and the Working Group has a very high degree of confidence in the ability of an inspection
program to detect the damage before it impairs safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group has reviewed Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2267, and has recommended it to the FAA for mandatory
inspection following modification to ensure the successful long-term operation of Model 747 series airplanes.
The procedures contained in this service bulletin address reports of corrosion and cracking in the body skin of the
lap joints under the wing-to-body fairing on Model 747 series airplanes that had accumulated between 21,500 flight
hours and 33,000 flight hours. Operators have also reported finding corrosion and cracks at the lower body lap joints
forward and aft of the wing-to-body fairing on airplanes that had accumulated more than 9,000 flight hours. Additionally,
operators have reported finding fatigue cracking in the body frames adjacent to the lap joints on airplanes that had
accumulated more than 10,000 flight cycles. Continued operation of these airplanes with corroded lap joints and
cracked or broken adjacent frames could cause the skin to separate, which could lead to rapid loss of pressure in the
airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has concurred with the Working Group's recommendations and has determined that AD action is warranted to mandate
the inspections to assure the continued airworthiness of the Model 747 fleet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Revision 3 of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2267, dated March 26, 1992, that
describes procedures for external high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect cracking in the upper
row of fasteners in the lower lobe of the fuselage skin lap joints. Certain inspections to detect cracking of the lower
lobe lap joints described in this service bulletin are required by AD 86&hyph;09&hyph;07 R1, which references the
original issue of this service bulletin, dated March 8, 1986, and Revision 1, dated September 25, 1986. The ``full''
modification (including the ``permanent'' repair) and the ``optional'' modification of the lower lobe lap joints
described in this service bulletin are required by AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, which also references both the original
issue of this service bulletin and Revision 1. The inspections to detect corrosion described in this service bulletin
are required by AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;6790 (55 FR 49268, November 27, 1990).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require repetitive external high frequency eddy current inspections to detect cracking
in the upper row of fasteners in modified lap joints, and repair, if necessary. The inspections would be required to
be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of this proposed AD are not intended to duplicate, rescind, or supersede the requirements of AD 86&hyph;09&hyph;07
R1, AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, or AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05. The FAA's intent is to require the external HFEC inspections,
described above, of older airplanes following the mandatory modifications required by AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06,
in addition to those inspections required by AD 86&hyph;09&hyph;07 R1 and AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 200 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 118 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 124 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $804,760, or $6,820 per
airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this
AD action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA recognizes that the proposed inspections would require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However,
the compliance times specified in paragraph (a) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for the inspections to
be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby
minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Canadair
Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspection to detect chafing of the
wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG), modification of the wiring harness, and repair of any chafed harness.
This proposal is prompted by a report that the wiring harness on certain airplanes were produced in a configuration
that is subject to chafing and electrical shorting. The actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of ADG power to the essential bus when the ADG is deployed during
an emergency situation.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 23, 1991, the FAA issued AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8026 (56 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
45893, September 9, 1991), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CL&hyph;600&hyph;2A12, and CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes. That AD requires inspection to detect chafing
and modification of the wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG), and repair of any chafed harness. That action
was prompted by reports of chafing of the ADG electrical output harness against the backshell of the connector on the
turbine generator assembly. Although the chafing occurred while the ADG was in the stowed position, when the ADG was
deployed, the chafed wires shorted to the airplane structure and prevented the ADG from powering the essential bus.
This essential bus provides electrical power to the hydraulic flight control system and to the essential flight control
equipment. In these instances, the shorting also damaged the ADG output harness and its support structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of emergency power to the essential bus when the ADG is deployed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01, Transport Canada Aviation, which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness authority for Canada, notified the FAA that the same unsafe condition addressed in AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01
may exist on certain additional Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes. Transport Canada Aviation advises
that, during production of Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131,
inclusive, the wiring harnesses of the ADG's were not modified to preclude chafing against the backshell of the connector
on the turbine generator assembly. (AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 is applicable only to airplanes having serial numbers
5001 through 5098, inclusive.) Therefore, these airplanes are also subject to losing ADG power to the essential bus
when the ADG is deployed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during an emergency situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canadair has issued Alert Service Bulletin A601&hyph;0370, Revision 1, dated April 15, 1993, that describes procedures
for a one-time inspection to detect chafing and modification of the ADG wiring harness, and repair of any chafed harness.
This modification entails replacing two existing harness support brackets with redesigned brackets that would
preclude chafing of the harness. The effectivity of this service bulletin includes Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16
series airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131 only. Transport Canada Aviation classified this alert
service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;91&hyph;21R1, dated May 6,
1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness
agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined
the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is
necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require inspection to detect chafing and modification
of the wiring harness of the ADG, and repair of any chafed harness. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. This proposed AD would apply only to airplanes
having serial numbers 5099 through 5131, inclusive.

Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA's normal policy is that when an AD requires a substantive change, such as a change in its applicability, the
``old'' AD is superseded by removing it from the system and a new AD is added. In the case of this AD action, the FAA normally
would have proposed superseding AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 to expand its applicability to include the additional affected
airplanes. However, in reconsideration of the entire fleet size that would be affected by a supersedure action, and
the consequent workload associated with revising maintenance record entries, the FAA has determined that a less
burdensome approach is to issue a separate AD applicable only to these additional airplanes. This AD does not supersede
AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01; airplanes listed in the applicability of AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 are required to continue
to comply with the requirements of that AD. This proposed AD is a separate AD action, and is applicable only to airplanes
having serial numbers 5099 through 5131, inclusive.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that 25 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspection on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,375,
or $55 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that it would take approximately 9 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification
and the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $199 per airplane. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification on U.S. operators is estimated to be $17,350 or $694
per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the figures, above, the total (inspection plus modification) cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $18,725 or $749 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model
F27 series airplanes. This proposal would require accomplishment of certain structural modifications. This proposal
is prompted by reports of incidents involving fatigue cracking and corrosion in transport category airplanes that
are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. These incidents have jeopardized the airworthiness
of the affected airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent degradation in the structural
capabilities of the affected airplanes. This action also reflects the FAA's decision that long term continued operational
safety should be assured by actual modification of the airframe rather than repetitive inspections.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1988, a transport category airplane managed to land after tiny cracks in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rivet holes in the upper fuselage linked together, causing structural failure and explosive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decompression. An 18-foot section ripped from the fuselage. This accident focused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater attention on the problem of aging aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1988, the FAA sponsored a conference on aging airplane issues, which was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attended by representatives of the aviation industry from around the world. It became 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obvious that, because of the tremendous increase in air travel, the relatively slow pace of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new airplane production, and the apparent economic feasibility of operating older 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology airplanes rather than retiring them, increased attention needed to be focused on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this aging fleet and maintaining its continued operational safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA, in concert with the Regional Airline Association (RAA); the General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA); several U.S. and non-U.S. operators of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected airplanes; the Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the Netherlands; and Fokker; has agreed to undertake the task of identifying and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing procedures to ensure continuing structural airworthiness of aging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commuter-class airplanes. This group reviewed selected service bulletins, applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker Model F27 series airplanes, to be recommended for mandatory rulemaking action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure the continued operational safety of these airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This group's proposal is contained in Fokker Report Number SE&hyph;278, ``F27 Aging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aircraft Project-Final Document,'' Issue 3, dated February 1, 1993. This Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
references modifications from eight service bulletins and recommends that they be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated in the applicable Fokker Model F27 series airplanes. The modifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consist of three modifications to the fuselage, two modifications to the wing, and three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications to the empennage of the airplane. They include structural reinforcement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frames, ribs, and stringers; replacement of formers and ribs; and installation of inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doors and covers, access holes, and drain holes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures described in these service bulletins are intended to positively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address conditions identified in Model F27 series airplanes that, if not corrected, could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in structural failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RLD classified this Report as mandatory and issued Netherlands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airworthiness Directive (BLA) 91&hyph;058/5 (A), dated July 16, 1993, in order to assure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since fatigue cracking and corrosion are likely to exist or develop on other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require modification of Fokker Model F27 series airplanes prior to their economic design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goal in accordance with the Fokker Report described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic design goal of an airplane is typically considered to be the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service after which a substantial increase in the maintenance costs is expected to take place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to assure continued operational safety. The economic design goal for Fokker 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model F27 series airplanes is 90,000 landings for structural problems associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatigue damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed compliance time for implementation of the mandatory structural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification program is prior to reaching the applicable economic design goal. This time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interval was determined based upon the ability of the manufacturer to provide the parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for the modification, and the time necessary to incorporate the modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interim, safety will be provided by various means currently in place that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered satisfactory to detect damage prior to the occurrence of an unsafe condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These include operators' on-going basic maintenance programs; continuing inspections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by numerous previously issued AD's; the Structural Integrity Program (SIP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, previously mandated by AD 92&hyph;19&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;8365 (57 FR 42693, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 16, 1992); the FAA's increased emphasis on surveillance of operators' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance programs and procedures; and the FAA's participation in programs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physically inspect high-time airplanes during scheduled heavy maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 58 Fokker Model F27 series airplanes (excluding Mark 050 series airplanes) of U.S. registry
would be affected by this proposed AD within the initial threshold. Since not all affected airplanes would be required
to accomplish every modification referenced in each of the service bulletins, the cost impact of the proposed modifications
is estimated in the following table. This cost includes the price of modification kits, and the estimated labor rate
is $55 per work hour. It does not include the cost of downtime, planning, set up, familiarization, or tool acquisition.

Based on these figures, above, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,958,245.75.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the proposed modifications would require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However,
the threshold specified in each of the service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulletins referenced by the Fokker Report should allow ample time for the accomplishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the modifications coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes. This proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require the implementation of a corrosion prevention and control program either by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplishing specific tasks or by revising the maintenance inspection program to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a program. This proposal is prompted by reports of incidents involving corrosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fatigue cracking in transport category airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their economic design goal; these incidents have jeopardized the airworthiness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degradation of the structural capabilities of the airplane due to the problems associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with corrosion.

Discussion

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1988, a high-cycle transport category airplane (specifically, a Boeing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model 737) was involved in an accident in which the airplane suffered major structural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage during flight. Investigation of this accident revealed that the airplane had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerous fatigue cracks and a great deal of corrosion. Subsequent inspections conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the operator on other high-cycle transport category airplanes in its fleet revealed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes had extensive fatigue cracking and corrosion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prompted by the data gained from this accident, the FAA sponsored a conference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on aging airplanes in June 1988, which was attended by representatives from the aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry and airworthiness authorities from around the world. It became obvious that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the tremendous increase in air travel, the relatively slow pace of new airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, and the apparent economic feasibility of operating older technology airplanes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than retiring them, increased attention needed to be focused on the aging airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fleet and maintaining its continued operational safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America and the Aerospace Industries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association (AIA) of America agreed to undertake the task of identifying and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing procedures to ensure the continued structural airworthiness of aging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport category airplanes. An Airworthiness Assurance Task Force (AATF) was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established in August 1988, with members representing aircraft manufacturers, operators, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory authorities, and other aviation industry representatives worldwide. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective of the AATF was to sponsor ``Working Groups'' to:

1. Select service bulletins, applicable to each airplane model in the transport fleet, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be recommended for mandatory modification of aging airplanes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Develop corrosion-directed inspections and prevention programs;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The working group assigned to review the Fokker Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed its work on Item (2) and has developed a baseline program for controlling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion problems that may jeopardize the continued airworthiness of the Model F&hyph;27 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fleet. The program is contained in Fokker Document SE&hyph;291, ``F&hyph;27 Corrosion Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program,'' with revisions through October 1, 1993. (Hereafter, this publication is referred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to as ``the Document.'') The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority for the Netherlands, classified this Document as mandatory and issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Netherlands Airworthiness Directive (BLA) 91&hyph;113, Issue 2, dated June 26, 1992, in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in The Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2.1 of the Document defines three levels of corrosion: Level l corrosion is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that which does not exceed certain limits; Level 2 corrosion is that which exceeds those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits; and Level 3 corrosion is significant corrosion which is potentially an urgent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the Document provide general guidelines to develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion prevention and control program. These guidelines address such things as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline program, implementation ages, access for inspection, repetitive inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervals, operating environment, newly-acquired airplanes, general cleanliness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane, and the fact that sampling is unreliable in effectively controlling corrosion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2.4 of the Document sets forth the general implementation schedule for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion inspection/control program. As described in that section, each ``aircraft zone'' is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned an ``Initial Inspection Time'' and a ``Repeat Inspection Time.'' The program is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to each aircraft zone on all Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes whose age has reached 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or exceeded the Initial Inspection Time for that zone. For airplanes that have not reached 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or exceeded the Initial Inspection Time of the specific aircraft zone, a particular inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
task has to be performed before the airplane has reached the Initial Inspection Time for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific aircraft zone, or before the Repeat Inspection Time of the task is exceeded (a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum of 6 years), whichever occurs later. For airplanes that have already reached or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeded the Initial Inspection Time of the specific aircraft zone, a particular inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has to be performed before the Repeat Inspection Time of the task is exceeded or within 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, whichever occurs first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2.4 of the Document also identifies the specific aircraft zones that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the program, and describes the ``basic task'' to be accomplished in each defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aircraft zone as part of the baseline program, along with the initial inspection time and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeat inspection time for each area, and other information necessary to carry out the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program for each area. The Document defines a ``basic task'' as including not only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertinent visual inspections of all primary and secondary structures, but any necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repairs, application of sealants or corrosion inhibitors, and other follow-on procedures, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well. A basic task may also include detailed visual and non-destructive inspections (NDI); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where NDI's are employed, adequate standards and procedures must be developed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly recorded for the area inspected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2.5 establishes the procedures for reporting the results of the inspections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted under the corrosion prevention and control program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2.6 provides for periodic review and update of the data contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since corrosion is likely to exist or develop on airplanes of this type design, an AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is proposed which would require adoption of a corrosion prevention and control program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is equivalent to or better than the program specified in the Document previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described. Operators would be permitted to accomplish this either by performing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific basic tasks described in the Document (the ``task-by-task method''), or by revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their FAA-approved maintenance program to include such a program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of the proposal sets forth the proposed compliance times for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial basic task of each affected aircraft zone. These compliance times are measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a date one year after the effective date of the final rule. (The proposed compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times are consistent with those of other similar AD's that the FAA has issued on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject.) Generally, operators would be required to complete the initial basic task before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaching the ``Initial Inspection Time'' plus one ``Repeat Inspection Time'' interval for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aircraft zone, as detailed in the Document. The basic task would be required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated at a time interval not to exceed the ``Repeat Inspection Time'' interval for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, as detailed in the Document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) includes paragraph (a)(1)(iii), which states that, for each area that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the initial inspection time for that area, operators must accomplish the initial basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
task at a minimum rate of one such area every two years, beginning one year after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of the final rule. The FAA recognizes that this may cause a hardship on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some small operators; in those circumstances, the FAA anticipates evaluating requests for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment to the implementation rate on a case-by-case basis under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (h) of the proposed rule. (A note to this effect is included in the proposal.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators should note that the proposal does not contain a paragraph specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to address repair actions. The FAA considers that any repairs would be carried out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessarily as a part of each basic task, as it is defined in the Document. As discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously, a ``basic task'' is defined in the Document as including not only the pertinent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection, but any necessary repairs, application of corrosion inhibitors, and other follow- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on procedures, as well. Paragraph (a) contains a note to reference the portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document that defines a basic task, and to emphasize the importance of these corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of the proposal provides for an optional method of complying with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule. In lieu of performing the task-by-task requirements proposed in paragraph (a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators may revise their FAA-approved maintenance/inspection programs to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion prevention and control program defined in the Document or an equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) also would require that, subsequent to the accomplishment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial basic task, any extensions of Repeat Inspection Time intervals specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document must be approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any operator electing to comply with proposed paragraph (b) would be permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use an alternative recordkeeping method to that otherwise required by Federal Aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations (FAR) section 91.417 or section 121.380, provided it is approved by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA and is included in a revision to the FAA-approved maintenance/inspection program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to questions raised previously concerning recordkeeping and record retention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements as they relate to the programmatic approach proposed in this AD action and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other similar proposals that have been issued applicable to other airplane models, the FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offers the following:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 91.417(a)(2)(v) and 121.380(a)(2)(v) of the FAR require that a record be made of the current status of applicable
AD's. With regard to proposed paragraph (b), such a record would be required to be made when the maintenance/inspection
program is revised to incorporate the program specified in the Document; at that time, paragraph (b) of the AD would
be fully complied with. Regarding paragraphs (d) through (g) of this proposal, those paragraphs would impose separate
requirements; therefore, except as discussed below, separate entries would have to be made to reflect compliance
with each of those paragraphs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121.380(a)(2)(iv) of the FAR concerns recording ``the identification of the current inspection status
of the aircraft.'' Section 91.417(a)(2)(iv) contains a similar requirement. Because proposed paragraph (b) would
require operators to revise their maintenance/inspection program to include the program specified in the Document,
each operator's program would be required to identify each inspection (e.g., ``C'' check) at which each basic task
specified in the Document will be performed on each airplane. By recording the current inspection status of each airplane,
and by maintaining a cross-reference system between these records and the maintenance/inspection program revision,
it will be possible to determine the current status of each basic task on each airplane. Once this cross-reference
system has been established, this recording provision of Sections 91 and 121 requires no additional recording beyond
what would otherwise be required normally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121.380(a)(1) concerns ``records necessary to show that all requirements for the issuance of an airworthiness
release under section 121.709 have been met.'' Section 91.417(a)(1) contains a similar requirement. These are also
referred to as ``dirty fingerprint records.'' This provision of sections 91 and 121 requires most of the recording
that would result from this proposed AD. Each time a basic task is performed, the operator would be required to make
a ``dirty fingerprint'' record of the task, identifying what actions were accomplished. It should be noted, however,
that these records are not different from the records made for any other actions taken under the operator's maintenance/inspection
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the record making requirements, discussed above, sections 91 and 121 of the FAR impose requirements
for record retention:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121.380(b)(1) and Section 91.417(b)(1) require that the ``dirty fingerprint'' records be retained until
the work is repeated or superseded by other work, or for one year after the work is performed. Therefore, most of the
records resulting from this proposed AD would not have to be retained indefinitely. However, such retention might
facilitate subsequent transfers, or substantiate requests for repetitive interval escalations, and therefore,
may be in the operator's interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121.380(b)(2) requires that the records specified in paragraph 121.380(a)(2) [current status of AD's and
current inspection status] be retained and transferred with the airplane at the time it is sold. Section 91.417(b)(2)
contains a similar requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These recording requirements are not considered to be unduly burdensome and are considered the minimum necessary
to enable the cognizant FAA Maintenance Inspector to perform proper surveillance and to ensure that the objectives
of the proposed rule are being fulfilled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because of the numerous concerns expressed previously by operators regarding the recordkeeping obligations
imposed by section 121.380 with regard to similar rulemaking on corrosion prevention and control programs, the FAA
has included in this proposal certain provisions for alternative recordkeeping methods. Proposed paragraph (b)(1)
would provide for the development and implementation of such alternative methods, which must be approved by the FAA.
For example, operators may choose to submit proposals to record compliance with paragraphs (d) through (g) of the
AD by a means other than they normally use to record AD status. (The FAA has developed guidance material that will contain
information to be considered by FAA Principal Maintenance Inspectors (PMI) when reviewing proposals for alternative
recordkeeping methods.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of the proposal provides for increasing a ``Repeat Inspection Time'' interval by up to 10% in order to
accommodate unanticipated scheduling requirements. Operators would be required to inform the FAA within 30 days
of such increases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(1) of the proposal sets forth the reporting actions that are necessary to be accomplished when Level
3 corrosion is determined to exist. Within 7 days after such a determination is made, an operator would be required
to accomplish one of the following actions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Submit a report of the determination to the FAA and complete the basic task in the affected area on the remainder of
the Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes in the operator's fleet; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Submit a proposed schedule, for approval by the FAA, for performing the basic tasks in the affected area on the remainder
of the operator's Model F&hyph;27 series fleet; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Submit data substantiating that the Level 3 corrosion was an isolated occurrence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the FAA has received such a report, it may, in conjunction with normal surveillance activities, request additional
information regarding the results of the basic tasks performed on the remainder of the operator's Model F&hyph;27
series fleet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2) of the proposal specifies that the FAA may impose schedules different from what an operator has proposed
under paragraph (d)(1), if it is found that changes are necessary to ensure that any other Level 3 corrosion in the operator's
Model&blank;&blank; F&hyph;27 series fleet is detected in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(3) of the proposal would require that, within the time schedule approved by the FAA, the operator must
accomplish the basic tasks in the affected areas on the remaining airplanes in its Model F&hyph;27 series fleet to
ensure that any other Level 3 corrosion is detected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) would require that, upon finding corrosion exceeding Level 1 during a repetitive inspection, an operator
must adjust its program to ensure that future corrosion findings are limited to Level 1 or better. Where corrective
action is necessary to reduce corrosion to Level 1 or better, an operator must submit a proposal for a means of corrective
action for the FAA's approval within 60 days after the determination of corrosion is made. That means, approved by
the FAA, must then be implemented to reduce future findings of corrosion in that area to Level 1 or better.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to paragraph (e), it should be noted that if corrosion is found and it is not considered representative
of the operator's fleet, no further corrective action may be necessary, since a means to reduce any corrosion to Level
1 or better will have already been implemented in the operator's program in accordance with proposed paragraph (a)
or (b). For example, if a finding of corrosion is attributable to a particular spill of mercury or other unique event,
or if corrosion is found on an airplane recently acquired from another operator, the means specified in the existing
program may be adequate for controlling corrosion in the remainder of the operator's fleet. Similarly, if an operator
has already implemented means to reduce corrosion in an airplane area based on previous findings, no additional corrective
action may be necessary. In reviewing the reports submitted in accordance with the AD, the FAA will monitor the effectiveness
of the operator's means to reduce corrosion. If the FAA determines that an operator has failed to implement adequate
means to reduce corrosion to Level 1 or better, appropriate action will be taken to ensure compliance with this paragraph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f) of the proposal concerns adding airplanes to an operator's fleet, and the procedures that must be followed
with regard to corrosion prevention and control. This paragraph differentiates between procedures applicable
to added airplanes that previously were maintained in accordance with this AD and those that were not so maintained.
For airplanes that previously have been maintained in accordance with the proposed requirements of this AD action,
the first basic task in each aircraft zone to be performed by the new operator would be required to be performed in accordance
with either the previous operator's or the new operator's inspection schedule, whichever would result in the earlier
accomplishment date for that task. For airplanes that have not been maintained in accordance with the proposed requirements
of this AD action, the first basic task in each aircraft zone to be performed by the new operator would be required to
be performed before the airplane is placed in service, or in accordance with a schedule approved by the FAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the requirements of paragraph (f), the FAA considers it essential that operators ensure that transferred
airplanes are inspected in accordance with the baseline corrosion prevention and control program on the same basis
as if there were continuity in ownership. Scheduling of the inspections for each airplane must not be delayed or postponed
due to a transfer of ownership; in some cases, such postponement could continue indefinitely if an airplane is transferred
frequently from one owner to another. The proposed rule would require that the specified procedures be accomplished
before any operator places into service any airplane subject to the requirements of the proposed AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g) of the proposal would require that reports of Level 2 and Level 3 corrosion be submitted to Fokker within
certain time periods after such corrosion is detected. A note has been included in this paragraph indicating that
reporting to the FAA of any Level 2 or Level 3 corrosion found as a result of any opportunity inspections is highly desirable.
Operators are not relieved, however, from reporting corrosion findings as required by FAR section 121.703.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 55 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. It would take an average
of approximately 7 work hours per basic task to accomplish the 75 basic tasks called out in the Document; this represents
a total average of 525 work hours. The average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators for the 6-year average inspection cycle is estimated to be $1,588,125,
or $28,875 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the
required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy,
an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only
after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting
and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety
that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that
this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore
that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit
analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As used throughout this AD, the term ``the FAA'' is defined differently for different operators, as follows: For those
operators complying with paragraph (a) of this AD, ``the FAA'' is defined as ``the Manager of the Standardization
Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.'' For those operators operating under Federal Aviation
Regulation (FAR) part 121 or 129, and complying with paragraph (b) of this AD, ``the FAA'' is defined as ``the cognizant
Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI).'' For those operators operating under FAR part 91 or 125, and complying with
paragraph (b) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this AD, ``the FAA'' is defined as ``the cognizant Maintenance Inspector at the appropriate FAA Flight Standards
office.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA recommends that priority for implementing the corrosion prevention and control program, specified in this
AD, be given to older aircraft and areas requiring a significant upgrade of previous maintenance procedures to meet
the program requirements.

(1) Complete the initial basic task of each aircraft zone specified in section 2.4 of the Document as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For airplane areas that have not yet exceeded the ``Initial Inspection Time (IIT)'' for a basic task as of one year
after the effective date of this AD: Initial compliance must occur no later than the IIT, or no later than one Repeat
Inspection Time (RIT) interval measured from a date one year after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs
later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For airplane areas that have exceeded the IIT for a particular basic task as of one year after the effective date
of this AD: Initial compliance must occur within one RIT interval for that task, or within 6 years, measured from a date
one year after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this AD, accomplish the initial basic task, for each
area that exceeds the IIT for that area, at a minimum rate of one such area every two years, beginning one year after the
effective date of this AD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note 8: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph does not require inspection of any area that has not exceeded the IIT for that area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note 9: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This minimum rate requirement may cause an undue hardship on some small operators. In those circumstances, requests
for adjustments to the implementation rate will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis under the provisions of paragraph
(h) of this AD. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Repeat each basic task at a time interval not to exceed the RIT interval specified in the Document for that task.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD: Prior to one year after the effective date of this
AD, revise the FAA-approved maintenance/inspection program to include the corrosion control program specified
in the Document; or to include an equivalent program that is approved by the FAA. In all cases, the initial basic task
for each airplane area must be completed in accordance with the compliance schedule specified in paragraph (a)(1)
of this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any operator complying with paragraph (b) of this AD may use an alternative recordkeeping method to that otherwise
required by FAR section 91.417 or section 121.380 for the actions required by this AD, provided it is approved by the
FAA and is included in a revision to the FAA-approved maintenance/inspection program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Subsequent to the accomplishment of the initial basic task, extensions of RIT intervals specified in the Document
must be approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) To accommodate unanticipated scheduling requirements, it is acceptable for an RIT interval to be increased by
up to 10%, but not to exceed 6 months. The FAA must be informed, in writing, of any such extension within 30 days after
such adjustment of the schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(1) If, as a result of any inspection conducted in accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this AD, Level 3 corrosion
is determined to exist in any airplane area, accomplish either paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) within 7 days after
such determination: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Submit a report of that determination to the FAA and complete the basic task in the affected aircraft zones on all
Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes in the operator's fleet; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Submit to the FAA for approval one of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A proposed schedule for performing the basic tasks in the affected aircraft zones on the remaining Model F&hyph;27
series airplanes in the operator's fleet, which is adequate to ensure that any other Level 3 corrosion is detected
in a timely manner, along with substantiating data for that schedule; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Data substantiating that the Level 3 corrosion found is an isolated occurrence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 10: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 2.1 of the Document, which would permit corrosion that otherwise meets
the definition of Level 3 corrosion (i.e., which is determined to be a potentially urgent airworthiness concern requiring
expeditious action) to be treated as Level 1 if the operator finds that it ``can be attributed to an event not typical
of the operator's usage of other airplanes in the same fleet,'' this paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that data substantiating any such finding be submitted to the FAA (ref. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note 2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The FAA may impose schedules other than those proposed, upon finding that such changes are necessary to ensure
that any other Level 3 corrosion is detected in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Within the time schedule approved under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this AD, accomplish the basic tasks in the
affected aircraft zones of the remaining Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes in the operator's fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If, as a result of any inspection after the initial inspection conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b)
of this AD, it is determined that corrosion findings exceed Level 1 in any area, within 60 days after such determination,
implement a means, approved by the FAA, to reduce future findings of corrosion in that area to Level 1 or better. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Before any operator places into service any airplane subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this AD, a schedule for the accomplishment of basic tasks required by this AD must be established in
accordance with paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this AD, as applicable: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For airplanes previously maintained in accordance with this AD, the first basic task in each aircraft zone to be
performed by the new operator must be accomplished in accordance with the previous operator's schedule or with the
new operator's schedule, whichever would result in the earlier accomplishment date for that task. After each basic
task has been performed once, each subsequent task must be performed in accordance with the new operator's schedule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For airplanes that have not been previously maintained in accordance with this AD, the first basic task for each
aircraft zone to be performed by the new operator must be accomplished prior to further flight or in accordance with
a schedule approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Within 7 days after the date of detection of any Level 3 corrosion, and within 3 months after the date of detection
of any Level 2 corrosion, submit a report to Fokker of such findings, in accordance with section 2.5 of the Document.

Compliance With Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is exempted from review by the office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Reduction
of Regulatory Burden).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance With Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

Compliance With the National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

Summary of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking represents the next step in the process of licensing the world's first commercial
low-earth orbit satellites offering both voice and data mobile satellite services (MSS). These satellites are to
operate in the 1610&hyph;1626.5/2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz frequency bands (1.6/2.4 GHz bands). The proposed systems
are to provide a wide range of services, including cellular-like mobile services to users anywhere, telephone service
to remote areas that are not linked to a communications network, position location services, search and rescue communications,
disaster management communications, environmental monitoring, paging services, facsimile transmission services,
cargo tracking, educational communications, and industrial monitoring. In addition to offering these services
to users in the United States, the proposed low-earth orbit systems have the capability to extend these offerings
throughout the world. This can potentially expand markets for U.S.-developed goods and services and to make a major
contribution to U.S. global competitiveness. It also offers the potential for significant economic and social advances
in developing countries by providing an ``instant'' telecommunications infrastructure at minimum cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six applications to construct satellite systems in these frequency bands were filed by the cut-off date. Five proposed
low-Earth orbit (LEO) systems. These were filed by Ellipsat Corporation, Motorola Satellite Communications Inc.,
Constellation Communications, Loral/Qualcomm Corporation, and TRW, Inc. The other application was filed by American
Mobile Satellite Corporation. AMSC proposed to add the additional MSS frequencies to its geostationary satellite
orbit (GSO) MSS system that was authorized in 1989. An international allocation for MSS in these frequency bands was
made in February 1992; a domestic allocation was adopted in December 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A negotiated rulemaking was undertaken from January through April 1993 to assist the Commission in establishing
technical and operational rules to govern this new service (hereinafter 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS) and in developing an arrangement
by which all six pending system proposals could be accommodated. Neither the Commission nor the applicants were able
to fashion a spectrum sharing compromise that was acceptable to all. The Committee did, however, reach consensus
regarding other major technical issues. After the Negotiated Rulemaking was concluded, the LEO applicants, in two
new ``partial settlement'' groups, submitted two new sharing proposals they assert would permit all LEO applications
to be granted. Both proposals are premised on excluding GSO systems from consideration for licensing in these frequency
bands.

Licensing Procedure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the applicants can develop or agree to an engineering solution or sharing scheme by which all proposed systems can
be accommodated, the Commission generally adopts this approach if it is otherwise in the public interest. In situations
where all applicants' proposed systems cannot be accommodated, the Commission must devise a method consistent with
the public interest for choosing among them. In such cases, the Commission has, as an initial matter, imposed rigorous
financial and technical requirements as a means of ensuring that those granted licenses are capable of expeditiously
implementing state-of-the-art systems that will serve the public interest. If it is not possible to accommodate
all qualified applicants, a further processing mechanism must be selected.

Qualification Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a means of encouraging new technology and of realizing the unique benefits that a global system can provide, the
Commission proposes a LEO design requirement (proposed rule &sect;25.143(b)(2)(i)). It solicits comment on this
proposal from both applicants and potential users, requesting that commenters address the potential for 1.6/2.4
GHz MSS systems to generate social, economic, and technical benefits, both domestically and globally, and the extent
to which these benefits are realizable with LEO and GSO satellites. The Commission further proposes that systems
be capable of serving all areas of the world, except for the polar regions, for at least 75% of each day. Specifically,
the Commission proposes that satellite systems be designed so that at least one satellite is visible above the horizon
at an elevation angle of at least 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; for at least 18 hours each day at latitudes less than 80
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; (proposed rule &sect;25.143(b)(2)(11)). To provide efficient and ubiquitous service to users throughout
the United States, the Commission also proposes to require systems to be capable of providing continuous voice services
to all areas of the United States (proposed rule &sect;25.143(b)(2)(iii)). That is, satellite systems must be designed
so that at least one satellite is visible above the horizon at elevation angles of at least 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; at any given time in all areas of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Commission proposes strict financial qualification requirements identical to those in the domestic
fixed-satellite service, where applications to implement space stations regularly exceed the number that can be
accommodated (proposed &sect;25.143(b)(3)). Specifically, the Commission proposes that MSS applicants be required
to provide evidence of current assets or irrevocably committed debt or equity financing sufficient to meet the estimated
costs of constructing and launching all planned satellites and operating the system for one year. These requirements
stem from the Commission's repeated experience that licensees without sufficient resources spend a significant
amount of time attempting to raise the capital needed to finance a satellite system (here, $97 million to $2 billion),
that these attempts often end unsuccessfully, and that qualified fully-financed applicants may be blocked from
entry during this several-year period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All applicants will be given the opportunity to amend their applications to bring them into compliance with any final
rules.

Processing Alternatives

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While a sharing solution could not be developed during the Negotiated Rulemaking, the Commission believes that the
recent LEO sharing proposals may form the basis for allowing it to proceed expeditiously with licensing. Both of the
LEO applicants' proposals appear to allow up to five LEO systems to be accommodated in the 16.5 MHz of spectrum allocated
to MSS in each transmission direction. This may be sufficient to allow all qualified applicants to be licensed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposes to assign licensees implementing code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems to 11.35
MHz of shared bandwidth at 1610&hyph;1621.35 MHz. It further proposes to assign a frequency division multiple access
(FDMA)/time division access (TDMA) system to 5.15 MHz of dedicated bandwidth at 1621.35&hyph;1626.5 MHz. When a
system is launched and read to begin operating, it will be permitted to operate over the entire assigned bandwidth
for that technology. Any in-orbit CDMA system will be required to operate compatibly with any newly launched CDMA
system. If only one CDMA system is implemented, the plan proposes to adjust the assignments for the system to 8.25 MHz
at 1610&hyph;1618.25 MHz, leaving the freed spectrum available for possible reassignment to the FDMA licensee or
for new entry. The Commission believes that 8.25 MHz should be ample to support a first-generation system and should
provide some flexibility in coordinating the system internationally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plan includes the 1.6 GHz band only. While CDMA systems will use the 2.4 GHz band for downlink transmissions, an
FDMA/TDMA system will use the 1.6 GHz band for both uplink and downlink transmissions. This may free some spectrum
in the 2.4 GHz band and provide some flexibility in assigning specific downlink spectrum segments to CDMA licensees.
For example, the Commission may decide to avoid licensing in those portions of the 2.4 GHz band that are especially
susceptible to inter-service interference. Thus, while the Commission proposes to license CDMA operators to share
the same amount of 2.4 GHz downlink spectrum as 1.6 GHz uplink spectrum, it does not propose specific frequencies for
downlink operations at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commission requests comment on all aspects of its sharing proposal.

Other Alternatives if Mutual Exclusivity is Not Resolved
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Commission's spectrum sharing plan, or some variation of it, does not permit the applications of all qualified
applicants to be granted, the Commission must devise a procedure for choosing among those applicants. Possibilities
include a comparable hearing, an auction, or a lottery. These alternatives are briefly discussed and, to expedite
licensing if mutual exclusivity is not resolved, the Commission proposes structures for both an auction and a lottery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's experience with comparative hearings has shown they usually are prolonged. Here, they would not
only delay the provision of needed service to the United States public, but the delay could disadvantage the United
States in coordinating a licensed system internationally. For these reasons, it may not be advisable to hold a comparative
hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 Budget Act gives the Commission the authority to employ competitive bidding procedures to select licensees
from among two or more mutually exclusive applicants provided that certain criteria are met. The Commission believes
it mutual exclusivity among the applicants cannot be resolved, an auction may be considered. Specifically, MSS licensees
will be providing a commercial subscription-based service that will enable subscribers to transmit or receive MSS
transmissions in the frequencies on which the MSS space stations will be licensed to operate. A competitive bidding
system should permit a new service to be more rapidly introduced than would a comparative hearing. It should also allow
the public to recover the value of the public spectrum resource being made available for commercial use. Further,
it should encourage efficient use of the electromagnetic spectrum by encouraging applicants to bid on only the minimum
amount of spectrum needed. The Commission recognizes that the statute also directs it to promote economic opportunity
by disseminating licenses to a wide variety of licensees, including small and minority businesses. It requests comment
on the manner in which this statutory obligation can be taken into account. The Commission also recognizes that an
auction may have unintended consequences internationally by encouraging other countries to impose licensing costs
on MSS systems. The Commission will carefully consider these concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission envisions that if an auction is employed, it will be conducted pursuant to the general framework adopted
in its Competitive Bidding Implementation Proceeding (PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253). The Commission also proposes
service-specific criteria. To maximize multiple entry and to encourage applicants to bid only for the minimum amount
of spectrum they require, the Commission proposes to auction the 16.5 MHz of bandwidth in each transmission direction
in eight paired 2.0625 MHz uplink and downlink segments. Based on the applicants' proposals, it appears that some
MSS systems could be implemented with as little as 2 to 4 MHz of spectrum in each transmission direction. To afford licensees
some flexibility, however, the Commission proposes to allow applicants to big successfully on up to four segments,
for a total of 8.25 MHz of bandwidth in each transmission direction. Given the CDMA applicants' proposals to share
spectrum, the Commission also questions whether it should permit successful bidders to agree to pool their spectrum
and implement co-frequency systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 309(i) of the Budget Act also authorizes the use of a lottery to select from among one or more mutually exclusive
applicants if the applications are accepted for filing before July 26, 1993. The Commission tentatively concludes
that if mutual exclusivity cannot be resolved, the statutory requirements for a system of random selection are met.
The Commission proposes to implement a lottery in a manner similar to its proposed auction framework. Specifically,
eight 2.0625 MHz paired segments would be offered, and each selectee would be limited to four segments. The Commission
questions whether it may be advisable to permit applicants to agree among themselves that they will implement co-frequency
systems if one of them is chosen as the tentative selectee, allowing the Commission to grant licenses to all qualified
applicants in the pool.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of these alternative processing mechanisms.

Interservice Sharing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The radioastronomy service (RAS), the aeronautical radionavigation service (ARS), the instructional television
fixed-service (ITFS), a variety of terrestrial services, and industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) equipment
all operate in portions of the bands allocated to MSS or in adjacent bands. The Committee studied the potential for
interference between MSS and these services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee, which included an RAS representative, reached a consensus regarding MSS&hyph;RAS sharing. These
recommendations, which form the basis for the Commission's proposed rules (&sect;25.213(a)), establish fixed
radius protection zones around the sixteen radio astronomy sites in the United States and set technical requirements
for MSS downlink transmissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GLONASS, the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System, is operating in the 1610&hyph;1616 MHz band pursuant to
International Radio Regulation RR 732. MSS stations may not cause harmful interference to or claim protection from
stations operating under RR 732. During the Negotiated Rulemaking, the FAA indicated that it sought to use GLONASS
in conjunction with the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) to provide aircraft ground approach and terminal communications.
The Committee determined that MSS can coexist with GLONASS now, but if GLONASS were used as proposed by the FAA, the
GLONASS/MSS interference problems at 1610&hyph;1616 MHz would be unresolvable. The Committee proposed that GLONASS
be moved below the 1610 MHz band or, in the alternative, that U.S. reliance on GLONASS be lessened or eliminated. Both
inter-agency and international negotiations have been initiated on this issue. We are encouraged that even if GLONASS
is used for aircraft approach communications, it will be moved to frequencies below 1610 MHz. The Committee's proposed
rules regarding e.i.r.p. limits pursuant to RR 731F and limitations on the use of MSS terminals on aircraft fall within
accepted international standards and are set forth for comment (proposed &sect;25.213(c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also suggested a variety of solutions to the likely interference problems between MSS and other services,
ranging from relocating existing licensees (e.g., ``grandfathered'' terrestrial stations operating in the 2483.5&hyph;2500
MHz band) to imposing stricter suppression requirements on transmissions in adjacent frequency bands (e.g., ITFS
stations operating above 2500 MHz). However, these interests were not represented on the Committee, nor were the
interests of ISM operators in the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band. In these cases, the Commission does not believe that
it can propose sharing rules without developing the record more fully. It therefore requests comment on the interference
environment and possible solutions from affected operators.

Feeder Links 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the fixed-satellite frequencies to be used for LEO MSS feeder links may also be used by GSO satellites, the Committee
studied the sharing potential between LEO and GSO satellites. It concluded that sharing was feasible. The Committee
also studied the obligations of the United States under RR 2613, which essentially requires a LEO operator to cease
operations when unacceptable interference is cause to a GSO system. To afford LEO operators some protection, the
Committee suggested that the U.S. seek international agreement that RR 2613 will not be invoked to require a LEO operator
to terminate transmissions unless: (1) The affected administrations reach agreement as to a level of ``accepted
interference,'' (2) the LEO system is operating in excess of these levels, and (3) the excess interference is caused
by the LEO satellite's failure to maintain sufficient angular separation between the satellites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission accepted the Committee's analysis that sharing between LEO feeder links and GSO systems is feasible
with coordination. Further, the Commission agrees with the Committee's interpretation of RR 2613 and has already
begun to explore, in international forums, issues relating to international coordination of and protection for
LEO system feeder links.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several applicants request feeder links in the 5/6 GHz frequency bands (C-band); other request the 20/30 GHz bands
(Ka-band). The FAA opposes feeder links at 5 GHz, arguing that feeder link operations would be incompatible with its
intended use of the band for new navigation aids. In a related Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the
Local Multi-point Distribution Service (CC Docket No. 92&hyph;297; FCC No. 94&hyph;12) 59 FR 7964, February 17.
1994 adopted the same day as this Notice, the Commission proposes to conduct a negotiated rulemaking to assist it in
assigning the 27.5&hyph;30.0 GHz frequency band. It expects, in the context of that proceeding, to be able to identify
sufficient spectrum to satisfy 1.6/2/4 GHz MSS operators. The Commission will, however, continue to pursue feeder
links at 5 GHz and will allow applicants to incorporate these bands or other bands if they become available.

The 1993 Budget Act requires that the provision of space segment capacity directly to commercial mobile radio service
(CMRS) providers be treated as common carriage. However, the Act gives the Commission the discretion to determine
whether the provision of space segment capacity to CMRS providers should be treated as common carriage. (Most of the
pending applicants propose to offer service through resellers.) The Commission tentatively concludes that 1.6/2.4
GHz MSS offering will, in most cases, fall within the definition of CMRS. The Commission requests comment on whether
1.6/2.4 GHz MSS space station licensees making satellite capacity available to CMRS providers should be required
to operate as common carriers. Specifically, the Commission requests comment regarding whether there may be any
public interest reasons to impose a legal compulsion upon 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS operators to serve the public indifferently,
and whether a decision to exempt operators from common carriage requirements will allow them to engage in unreasonable
or anticompetitive practices. The Commission recognizes that requiring common carriage may limit the amount of
foreign participation in these inherently global systems, potentially impeding international coordination of
these satellites. The Commission requests comment on the extent to which applicants are seeking foreign investment
and the extent to which a common carriage requirement may impact their plans. The Commission also requests comment
regarding the likelihood that 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS space station capacity will inherently be offered as an indifferent
holding out to the public.

Mobile Earth Station Licensing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposes to license gateway and tracking, telemetry and control (TT&amp;C) stations as fixed-satellite
earth stations under part 25 of the Commission's Rules. It also proposes a blanket licensing approach for mobile user
transceivers under which a service vendor would hold the authorization for a specified number of technically identical
units. The Commission's proposals for earth station licensing are contained in &sect;&sect;25.115(d) (applications
for earth station authorizations); 25.130(b) (filing requirements for transmitting earth stations); 25.133(b)
(period of construction; commencement of construction); 25.136 (operating provisions for earth station networks
in the 1.6/2.4 GHz mobile-satellite service); and 25.213 (technical requirements for the 1.6/2.4 GHz mobile-satellite
service). The Commission requests comment on these proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To help maintain an interference-free environment, the Commission proposes to require an end user to obtain the authorization
of the space station operator, either directly or through an authorized service vendor, before the user may transmit
to that system. The Commission believes that this approach will facilitate roaming by international user while still
protecting the domestic electromagnetic environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory treatment of earth station licensees will depend upon whether they will be providing CMRS, although
the Commission expects that they will. Earth station licensees that provide CMRS must be regulated as common carriers.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 114 currently requires automatic transmission vehicles with a ``park'' position on their transmission
to have a key-locking system that prevents removal of the key unless the transmission is locked in ``park'' or becomes
locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. In other words, under the first alternative, a vehicle
must be designed so that the key cannot be removed when the transmission shift lever or other shifting mechanism is
in any position other than ``park.'' NHTSA is proposing to amend this provision to prevent key removal only when the
shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in any designated shift position other than ``park.'' This
rulemaking action results from a petition submitted by Mazda. The agency believes that the proposed amendment would
provide greater flexibility to manufacturers, and not have any measurable impact on safety.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 30, 1990, NHTSA amended Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 114, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Theft Protection,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 to protect against injuries to children caused by vehicle rollaway in vehicles with automatic transmissions, where
children were able to shift the transmission of a parked vehicle. 55 FR 21868. The amendment required automatic transmission
vehicles with a ``park'' position to have a key-locking system that prevents removal of the key unless the transmission
is locked in ``park'' or becomes locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. The amendment became effective
on September 1, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In adopting the amendment, the agency explained that a study focusing on child-injuring rollaway accidents in Orange
County, California demonstrated that injuries caused by rolling vehicles posed a significant safety problem. That
study uncovered nine cases of children releasing the brake or moving the transmission shift lever, or both, causing
a parked vehicle to roll and injure the child operating the controls or children near the vehicle. Even though two of
the cases could be discounted for the purposes of the rulemaking in question because the vehicle's engine was running
and there was insufficient information to draw conclusions about some other situations, the study did establish
that the type of accident at issue was occurring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA explained that although the then-current Standard No. 114 did not prohibit systems which permit the transmission
lever to be shifted when the vehicle is parked and the ignition is locked, some manufacturers had voluntarily used
a transmission shift lever lock that precludes this possibility. The agency stated that these transmission shift
lever lock designs typically have two critical elements. First, the transmission shift lever lock requires the transmission
shift lever to be in ``park'' before a person can remove the key. Second, the device also prevents shifting the transmission
lever from ``park'' to another position once the key is removed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA estimated that installation of the required technology in the cars and light trucks not voluntarily equipped
by the rule's effective date would prevent an estimated 50 to 100 child-injuring rollaway accidents annually. The
agency stated that these injuries could be prevented at a relatively low cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 2, 1993, Mazda submitted a petition for rulemaking requesting that the agency amend the provision added
by the May 1990 final rule. That company claimed that an amendment was needed to clarify the requirement to make the
compliance test procedure ``objective.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mazda stated that, in a December 12, 1992 letter, NHTSA had notified it of an apparent noncompliance with Standard
No. 114. By way of explanation, the agency had sent Mazda a copy of a November 20, 1992 interpretation letter to Ford.
That interpretation letter was a response to a Ford letter written to NHTSA concerning a compliance issue for certain
of its keylocking systems which had been designed by Mazda. In its petition, Mazda stated that it was aware of at least
five other manufacturers which had been informed of apparent noncompliances with that same provision of Standard
No. 114.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its November 20, 1992 interpretation letter to Ford, NHTSA rejected a request by that company to interpret Standard
No. 114 to prevent key removal only when the transmission shift lever is in one of the available gear positioning detents
other than ``park,'' i.e., reverse, neutral, drive, first, or second, and not when the lever is at points between those
detents. The agency stated that following: We cannot agree with your suggested interpretation, as it is inconsistent
with the express language of S4.2.1. That section states that, with certain exceptions not at issue, the key-locking
system must prevent removal of the key unless the transmission or transmission shift lever is locked in ``park'' or
becomes locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. Stated more simply, key removal must be prevented
in all circumstances save those specified in S4.2.1. Neither the transmission nor the transmission shift lever is
locked in ``park'' when the lever is between the gear selector positioning detents. Therefore, under section S4.2.1,
key removal must be prevented in that situation, unless the transmission/transmission shift lower becomes locked
in ``park'' as a direct result of removing the key.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its petition, Mazda characterized the agency's interpretation as permitting ``intentional mispositioning''
of the transmission shift lever during compliance testing. That company argued that during the design and development
of the vehicles which are the subject of the agency's December 1, 1992 letter, it never understood ``intentional mispositioning''
to be a reasonable and legitimate means for testing compliance with Standard No. 114. It also argued that even if it
had such an understanding, it is not at all clear what kind of certification test procedure it would have used to assure
that key removal could not occur in any possible situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mazda also argued that it had reexamined the rulemaking record and found nothing to indicate that ``intentional mispositioning''
of the transmission shift lever was ever contemplated. In addition, Mazda alleged that even if this is now believed
by NHTSA to be an appropriate aspect of the performance required by the standard, the absence of an objective test procedure
for determining compliance with the standard results in a lack of objectivity and fails to satisfy the requirements
of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mazda requested that Standard No. 114 be amended to incorporate a provision that it considers to set forth an objective
performance requirement. The provision would specify testing with the transmission level in each detent position,
and moving the lever from detent position to detent position using force levels specified by the manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA rejects Mazda's claim that the existing provision in Standard No. 114 is non-objective. There is nothing subjective
about a requirement that a key-locking system must prevent removal of the key unless the transmission or transmission
shift lever is locked in ``park'' or becomes locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. As discussed
in the agency's interpretation letter, key removal must be prevented in all circumstances save those specified in
S4.2.1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the agency rejects Mazda's objectivity argument, NHTSA does believe it is appropriate to address in rulemaking
whether Standard No. 114 should be amended along the lines suggested by that company, albeit for different reasons.
In the preamble to the May 1990 final rule, the agency stated that it believed the injuries in question could be prevented
at a relatively low cost to manufacturers since most vehicles would already comply with the amendments. This belief
was based on the fact that the vast majority of vehicles with automatic transmissions already had transmission locking
systems or had already been scheduled to have newly designed systems installed. The agency assumed that all of those
locking systems were or would be designed in a manner that would comply with the requirements. However, it now appears
that some of these transmission locking systems do not comply with the requirements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on agency testing of post-September 1, 1992 vehicles, the agency estimates that approximately 650,000 model
year 1993 passenger cars and 18,000 light trucks do not meet the present requirement. For the final rule, the agency
estimated the consumer cost of redesigning the transmission key-locking system to be $6.75 to $14.00 per vehicle.
Those are maximum figures that include both the situation where a complying system must be installed and the situation
in which an existing system need only be adjusted in order to comply. In that respect, those figures likely overstate
costs for this rulemaking, especially those applicable to an existing system needing only a minor adjustment. Additionally,
some manufacturers have likely modified model year 1993 systems to comply with the existing requirements. Therefore,
the actual numbers of passenger cars and light trucks that do not now meet the requirements are probably less than the
estimates suggested above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since NHTSA did not anticipate the need for manufacturers to redesign a large number of transmission locking systems,
the agency believes that it should consider whether it is appropriate to require such redesign. This is particularly
true to the extent that the apparently noncomplying locking systems at issue result in essentially the same child-injury
prevention safety benefits as would occur if the systems were redesigned to comply with the current requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, Standard No. 114 currently requires automatic transmission vehicles with a ``park'' position
to have a key-locking system that prevents removal of the key unless the transmission is locked in ``park'' or becomes
locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. In other words, under the first alternative, a vehicle
must be designed so that the key cannot be removed when the transmission shift lever or other shifting mechanism is
in any position other than ``park.'' NHTSA is proposing to amend Standard No. 114 to instead require a key-locking
system that prevents removal of the key: (1) Whenever the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in
the park position, unless the transmission and transmission shift mechanism are locked in park or become locked in
``park'' as the direct result of removing the key, and (2) whenever the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully
placed in any designated shift position other than park, unless the transmission and transmission shift mechanism
become locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. The standard would no longer address key removal
when the transmission shift lever is between shift positions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NHTSA notes that, for nearly all current designs, the key cannot be removed if the transmission shift lever is in a
detent other than park. However, electronic designs can be produced which permit the key to be removed while the transmission
is in a position such as drive and then automatically move the shifting mechanism and transmission to park. Both the
existing language of Standard No. 114 and the proposed language permit such designs.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basic rationale for limiting the key-removal requirement to situations where the transmission shift lever is
in detent positions is that drivers are unlikely to attempt to remove the key when the transmission shift lever is between
shift positions. As a practical matter, drivers are likely to either leave the transmission in the gear they had last
used or attempt to put the transmission in park, before attempting key removal. The only chance for mispositioning
is therefore in the latter situation, and the agency believes the chance for such mispositioning is small. Therefore,
as a practical matter, when the agency decided to prohibit key removal in situations where the transmission was not
in park, it was essentially addressing situations where the shift lever was in detent positions other than park. A
more complete discussion of this rationale, which addresses the transmission designs currently at issue, is provided
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the key-removal requirement would be limited to situations where the shift mechanism is fully placed in any
designated shift position, it would be necessary for the agency to specify a means for determining whether the mechanism
is in such position. Under the proposal, a vehicle would be considered to be in ``park'' when the transmission gear
selection indicator shows that ``park'' has been selected and the vehicle will not roll away on an incline when the
parking brake is disengaged. A vehicle would be considered to be in a drive gear when the transmission gear selection
indicator shows that a drive gear has been selected and the vehicle can be moved under its own power. A vehicle would
be considered to be in ``neutral'' if the transmission gear selection indicator shows that ``neutral'' has been selected,
the vehicle is stopped, and activation of the accelerator pedal does not cause the vehicle to move.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of assessing the safety implications of the proposed amendment, it is necessary to evaluate the types of locking
systems that would likely be produced under it. NHTSA believes that the most likely types of systems are ones like the
Mazda-designed locking system that was the subject of the agency's November 1992 interpretation letter and the other
locking systems that led the agency to issue letters concerning apparent noncompliances.

Ford and Mazda first advised the agency of a possible compliance issue concerning the Mazda-designed locking system
in September 1992, shortly after the requirement at issue became effective. Ford advised that if key removal were
attempted while the transmission shift lever on a large proportion of 1993 Escorts and Tracers was placed at various
points between the ``reverse'' and ``park'' detents, the key could be removed while the selector lever was held short
of engaging the ``park'' detent, and without the transmission becoming locked in park. Ford and Mazda also demonstrated
these vehicles to NHTSA personnel. These personnel found that the transmission shift lever could be moved to a position
where it appeared to be in ``park,'' but where in fact the lever was not fully in the ``park'' position. After releasing
the shift lever in this position, the personnel could remove the key without the transmission's becoming locked in
park.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, in its November 1992 interpretation letter, NHTSA rejected Ford's suggestion that the agency
interpret Standard No. 114 to prevent key removal only when the transmission shift lever is in one of the available
gear positioning detents other than ``park.'' The agency stated that its interpretation was consistent with the
agency's intent in promulgating S4.2.1, explaining: As discussed in several rulemaking notices, NHTSA amended
Standard No. 114 to prevent vehicle rollaway caused by unattended children shifting the transmission lever in automatic
transmission vehicles. If a driver were able to remove the key while the transmission or transmission shift lever
were not locked in park, and if the transmission or transmission shift lever did not become locked in ``park'' as a result
of removing the key, a child might later shift the transmission shift lever, thereby causing a vehicle rollaway. For
this reason, we continue to believe that this amendment to Standard No. 114 meets the need for motor vehicle safety.

Subsequent to issuing the November 1992 interpretation letter, the agency conducted a number of compliance tests
for Standard No. 114. As a result of these tests, the agency sent letters to Mazda, Ford, Honda, GM, Suzuki, and Hyundai,
advising that, for certain of their vehicles, there was an apparent noncompliance with Standard No. 114's provision
requiring that key removal be prevented unless the transmission or transmission shift lever is locked in park or becomes
locked in park as a direct result of removing the key. (Copies of the correspondence between NHTSA and these manufacturers,
and the compliance test reports for the vehicles at issue, have been placed in the docket for this NPRM.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all of the vehicles for which tests showed apparent noncompliances, it was possible to remove the ignition key
from the key-locking system when the transmission shift lever was in a position between ``park'' and ``reverse,''
without the transmission becoming locked in ``park'' as a result of removing the key. The circumstances under which
the ignition key could be removed when the transmission shift lever was between ``park'' and ``reverse'' varied.
For some vehicles, the lever could simply be placed in a position between park and reverse, the hand that controlled
it removed, and the key then removed. For certain of these vehicles, this happened only over a very small range of lever
movement when the lever was very close to the park position and appeared to be in park, when in fact it was not fully in
the park position. For other vehicles, this condition existed for about half of the range of lever movement between
park and reverse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For another set of vehicles, key removal without the transmission becoming locked in park only happened if one hand
was kept on the transmission lever while the key was removed with the other hand, since the transmission lever would
``spring'' into park if the hand holding it between the two positions was removed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also notes that, while it was not a compliance issue before September 1, 1993, in some cases the transmission
shift lever could be moved from the ``park'' position after the key was removed if the thumb button on the transmission
shift lever was kept depressed while the shift lever was moved to the ``park'' position and the key was removed. (For
a discussion of this issue, see October 21, 1992 interpretation letter to Transportation Research Center, Inc.,
which has been placed in the docket for this NPRM.)

With respect to the problem of child-induced rollaway, the safety consequences of permitting these types of apparently
noncomplying systems are dependent on the likelihood that drivers would, in fact, remove the key in a manner that the
transmission would not be locked in park after such removal. If the existing requirement is complied with, removal
of the ignition key gives absolute assurance that the transmission is (or will become) locked in ``park'' and that
vehicle movement will not occur as a result of the shift lever being moved. If the proposed requirement is complied
with, removal of the ignition key while the transmission shift lever is fully placed in any designated shift position
would give the same assurance that the transmission is (or will become) locked in ``park,'' but the requirement would
no longer prohibit key removal in the circumstance when the lever is between detents. NHTSA is not aware of any specific
reported crashes that would be relevant to permitting these systems.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For some of the vehicles tested by the agency, deliberate action by the driver appears to be necessary in order to remove
the key without the transmission becoming locked in ``park.'' Such action is necessary where the driver must either
hold the shift lever between ``park'' and ``reverse'' with one hand while removing the key with the other hand, or keep
the thumb button depressed on the shift lever while removing the key. NHTSA tentatively concludes that there is no
basis to believe that drivers would deliberately make such efforts to defeat the transmission shift lock. Therefore,
the agency believes that permitting such systems would have no safety consequences, and that the existing requirement
is unnecessarily design-restrictive with respect to these systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For other of the vehicles tested by the agency, it is possible that a driver might inadvertently remove the key without
the transmission becoming locked in ``park.'' This could happen, for example, if the driver moved the lever so that
it appeared to be in ``park'' but was in fact short of the full ``park'' position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in order for such systems to result in any adverse safety consequences related to child-induced rollaway,
it would be necessary both for the driver to inadvertently fail to place the lever fully in the ``park'' position 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for a child to then play with the lever and/or the parking brake in a way that creates a rollaway. NHTSA believes that
either event would occur only very rarely and has tentatively concluded that the possibility of both events occurring
together is minuscule. Therefore, the agency does not believe that it is necessary to address this remote possibility
in a safety standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that its safety standards are intended to address unreasonable safety risks and not all conceivable risks
no matter how remote. The agency believes that its proposal is consistent with other actions that it has taken in this
area. For example, while NHTSA decided in the May 1990 final rule to require transmission shift locks for automatic
transmission vehicles, it also decided, based on a review of accident data, not to require such locks for manual transmission
vehicles. This did not mean that there was no conceivable risk of child-induced rollaways for manual transmission
vehicles, but instead that the risk was sufficiently small that the agency did not believe it was necessary to address
in a safety standard. Similarly, in June 1990, NHTSA denied a petition for rulemaking submitted by Mr. W. A. Barr requesting
that the agency issue requirements to address inadvertent vehicle movement associated with shifting automatic
transmissions into ``park,'' in part because of lack of evidence that the extent of the alleged problem was great enough
to warrant Federal intervention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is also proposing to amend the Purpose and Scope section of Standard No. 114 to clarify that the purpose of the
requirements at issue is to reduce the incidence of crashes resulting from the rollaway of parked vehicles with automatic
transmissions as a result of children moving the shift mechanism out of the ``park'' position. That section currently
indicates that the purpose of the requirements is to reduce the incidence of crashes resulting from rollaway of parked
vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA contemplates making the proposed amendments effective 30 days after publication of a final rule. The agency
tentatively concludes that there is good cause for such an effective date, since the amendments would impose no new
requirements but instead provide additional flexibility to manufacturers with no measurable impact on safety.

NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action under Executive Order 12866 and the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. This action has been determined to be not ``significant'' under either. As explained
above, the proposed amendments would impose no new requirements but instead provide additional flexibility to manufacturers,
with respect to transmission shift lock designs, with no measurable impact on safety. Also as stated above, the agency
estimates the annual consumer cost savings of adopting the proposed amendment to be a maximum of $6.75 to $14.00 per
affected vehicle. Accordingly, a full regulatory evaluation is not required.

small organizations and small governmental entities would not be affected in their capacity as purchasers of new
vehicles if this proposal were adopted in a final rule.

Safety Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state
may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the
Federal standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies
only to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure
for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That

S4.2.1(a) Except as provided in S4.2.2(a) and (b), the key-locking system required by S4.2 in each vehicle which has

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whenever the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in any designated shift position other than

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whenever the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in the park position, unless the transmission
and transmission shift mechanism are locked in park or become locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the
key.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The following procedure is used for determining whether the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed
in a designated position. The lever or other shifting mechanism is moved to a designated position and physical contact
with the lever or other shifting mechanism is ended. The lever or other shifting mechanism is considered to be fully
placed in the ``park'' position if the transmission gear selection indicator shows that ``park'' has been selected
and the vehicle will not roll away on a 10 percent grade when the parking brake is disengaged. The lever or other shifting
mechanism is considered to be fully placed in the ``neutral'' position if the ``neutral'' position is selected, the
transmission gear selection indicator shows that ``neutral'' has been selected, and activation of the accelerator
pedal does not cause the vehicle to move. The lever or other shifting mechanism is considered to be fully placed in a
forward or reverse drive position if the transmission gear selection indicator shows that a drive position has been
selected and the vehicle can be driven under its own power. For purposes of S4.2.1, rollaway is movement of a vehicle
greater than 100 mm.

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 90-day finding on a petition to remove seven species of invertebrates
that occur in karst topography in Travis and Williamson counties, Texas, from the List of Endangered and Threatened
Wildlife and Plants. The Service determines that the petition does not present substantial scientific or commercial
information indicating that delisting the Coffin Cave mold beetle (

Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Act), requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents
substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. To the
maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of receipt of the petition, and the finding is
to be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the finding is positive, the Service is also required to promptly commence a status review of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Judge John C. Doerfler, representing the Williamson County Commissioners Court, submitted a petition to the Service
to delist six species of endangered karst invertebrates in Travis and Williamson counties, Texas. The petition was
dated June 7, 1993, and received by the Service on that date. On June 16, 1993, the Service received a letter from attorney
J.B. Ruhl on behalf of the petitioners, clarifying the intent of the petition to incorporate recent taxonomic revisions
and the taxonomic reevaluation of five listed karst invertebrate species as seven species.

Several caves in Travis County contain more than one of the endangered karst invertebrates. These include Tooth Cave,
Amber Cave, Gallifer Cave, Kretschmarr Cave, and Kretschmarr Double Pit. These caves and others are protected under
the stewardship of the Texas System of Natural Laboratories (TSNL). In addition, some other caves are in preserves
regulated by the Cities of Austin and Georgetown. (For further discussion, see Factor D, ``The inadequacy of existing
regulatory mechanisms,'' below.) However, many of the caves containing endangered karst invertebrates currently
have no protection other than that provided by the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioners point out that, since publication of the final rule, new locations have been discovered for several
of the species, most notably the Tooth Cave ground beetle and the Bone Cave harvestman. The Tooth Cave ground beetle
was known from two caves about 2.5 kilometers (km) (1.5 miles (mi)) apart in Travis County, Texas, at the time of listing.
It is currently known from about 27 locations (24 confirmed, 3 tentative) along a 14-km (9-mi) distance in Travis and
Williamson counties, Texas. Only 10 of these caves are provided any degree of local protection (James Reddell, Texas
Memorial Museum, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). Seven of these caves are located in the small TSNL preserves discussed above, one is in a small preserve owned
by the City of Austin, and two are in small preserves acquired as mitigation for a development project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bone Cave harvestman was not described at the time of the original listing, but was thought to be the same species
as the Bee Creek Cave harvestman. The Bone Cave harvestman is currently known from about 69 locations (60 confirmed,
9 tentative) along a 40-km (25-mi) distance in Travis and Williamson counties, Texas. Of the 69 caves recorded as locations
of the Bone Cave harvestman, only 9 are provided any local protection. Three are TSNL caves, two are in City of Austin
preserves, two are in City of Georgetown preserves, and two were acquired as mitigation for a development project.
In addition, this species exhibits considerable geographical variation and loss of a significant number of locations
within a part of its range would result in a loss of genetic diversity within the species (Reddell, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). Few caves are provided any protection other than that now provided by the Act and their distribution is disjunct
and at the extremes of the species' range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of caves in which the other five endangered karst invertebrates have been found or tentatively identified
has increased slightly for three of the species, remained the same for another species (although its range has decreased),
and decreased for the fifth species.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion, known at the time of listing from Tooth and Amber caves, within a 1.3-km (0.8-mi) radius
in Travis County, remains confirmed only from the two original caves. The species has been tentatively identified
from Stovepipe Cave and Kretschmarr Double Pit, lying within the original range. Stovepipe Cave is located on private
property that the City of Austin has approved for development. The three remaining caves are located in the small TSNL
preserves discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Tooth Cave spider, known at the time of listing only from Tooth Cave, is now also confirmed at New Comanche Trail
Cave and tentatively identified from Gallifer and Stovepipe caves, all lying along a 4.5-km (3-mi) distance in northwest
Travis County, Texas. Tooth and Gallifer caves lie within small TSNL preserves, Stovepipe Cave is on private property
approved for development, and New Comanche Trail Cave is not protected and may be adversely impacted by a planned realignment
of New Comanche Trail Road.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coffin Cave mold beetle was not described at the time of listing, but was thought to belong to the same species as
the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle. The Coffin Cave mold beetle is currently confirmed from four caves and tentatively
identified from one cave, all occurring along a 17-km (10-mi) distance in Williamson County, Texas. Off Campus and
Sierra Vista caves are located in a small preserve surrounded by a subdivision; the adequacy of the preserve for long-term
protection of the species at those sites is uncertain. On Campus Cave lies on a high school campus. The status of the
type locality (Coffin Cave) is unknown; recent attempts to locate the species in Inner Space Cavern were unsuccessful
(Reddell, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle was believed to occur in four caves in Travis and Williamson counties at the time of
listing and is currently known from four caves in Travis County. A specimen from Coffin Cave was redescribed as the
Coffin Cave mold beetle and a new location for the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle was discovered at Stovepipe Cave. The
range of the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle has consequently decreased since the original listing from a 45-km (28-mi)
distance in Travis and Williamson counties to a 2-km (1.2-mi) distance in Travis County. Stovepipe Cave lies within
a proposed subdivision and the other three locations for the species, Tooth, Amber, and Kretschmarr caves, lie within
small TSNL preserves.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bee Creek Cave harvestman was believed to occur in five caves in Travis and Williamson counties at the time of listing.
It is currently confirmed at four caves and tentatively identified from two caves. The distribution of the Bee Creek
Cave harvestman consists of two disjunct areas, one about 5 km (3 mi) long and the other about 8 km (5 mi) in length, with
a distance of about 28 km (17 mi) between the northernmost and southernmost localities, all of which lie in Travis County.
Little Bee Creek Cave, Jester Estates Cave, and Kretschmarr Double Pit (a TSNL cave) are located in small preserve
areas. Bandit Cave is maintained as a small preserve, although attempts to relocate the Bee Creek Cave harvestman
in the cave in 1966, 1988, and 1989 were unsuccessful (Reddell, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). Cave Y is located in a proposed development area; the species' status in Bee Creek Cave is unknown since it has
not been possible to obtain permission to inspect the cave since 1975 (Reddell, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of these invertebrates are known to occur in large numbers (William Elliott, Texas Memorial Museum, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and pers. comm., 1993). The fact that several of the species are known to occur at several dozen locations should not
be interpreted to mean that those species are abundant. (See Factor A, ``The present or threatened destruction, modification,
or curtailment of its habitat or range,'' below).

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(1) of the Act and its implementing regulations (50 CFR part 424) set forth the procedures for adding species
to or removing species from the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species
due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the seven
karst invertebrates are re-evaluated in light of new information available to the Service and information presented
in the petition and are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service determined that the primary threat to these species comes from loss of habitat due to ongoing and proposed
development activities (final rule). The proximity of the caves inhabited by these species to the City of Austin makes
them vulnerable to continuing expansion of the Austin metropolitan area. Threats to specific caves occupied by these
species were addressed in the final rule (53 FR 36029). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The known ranges of the Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion, the Tooth Cave spider, the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle, the Coffin
Cave mold beetle, and the Bee Creek Cave harvestman have not appreciably increased since the original listing. Although
the range and number of known locations for the Tooth Cave ground beetle and the Bone Cave harvestman have increased
since the original listing, the degree of threat of habitat destruction or modification remains significant, and
may have increased, throughout the range of each species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Searches for karst features and karst fauna surveys have become more frequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the listing, as developers and landowners have sought to comply with the Act. Many of the new locations of these
karst invertebrates have been discovered as a result of biological surveys conducted prior to development or sale
of land; consequently, newly discovered locations are frequently threatened by habitat destruction and other threats
associated with development. The recent revitalization of the real estate market in the Austin metropolitan area
has maintained and intensified the threat of karst invertebrate habitat destruction and other associated threats.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners present a list of caves with endangered species that have been subject to some degree of disturbance.
They cite these cases as demonstrating that activities such as dumping, vandalism, and sealing of cave entrances
do not actually threaten the karst invertebrates. Reddell (in litt., 1993) counters that, in most of these cases,
the disturbance to the cave environment is recent in origin, minor in scale, and/or generally restricted to the immediate
entrance zone. The Service concurs with Reddell and believes that these examples do not present convincing evidence
that dumping, vandalism, and sealing entrances are harmless to the karst invertebrates. In most cases, not enough
time has elapsed since the disturbance to detect an effect on the karst invertebrates. The Service agrees with the
petitioners that there is little quantitative data available on the direct effects of trash dumping, vandalism,
sealing, and other disturbances on the karst invertebrates. However, there is substantial qualitative evidence
indicating that the threats to the karst invertebrates discussed in the final rule and in this finding are real, significant,
and ongoing. Reddell (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

of karst invertebrates in affected areas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioners cite the work of Crawford (1981) and Veni (1992) as evidence that the caves where the karst invertebrates
occur are not isolated ``islands'' of special habitat and that the invertebrates likely occur and move throughout
the karst in the interstitial spaces. In this interpretation, the petitioners misunderstand the Service's use of
the ``island'' analogy in the final rule. The final rule listing the karst invertebrates stated that the caves containing
the karst invertebrates ``occur in isolated `islands' '' of the Edwards limestone formation that were separated
from one another when stream channels cut through overlying limestone to lower rock layers'' (53 FR 36029). The Service
applied the island analogy to the distinct, geologically isolated karst areas (referred to in the Draft Recovery
Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993) and hereinafter as ``regions'') within which the caves containing the
karst invertebrates have formed, not to the individual cave systems. Veni's work (1992) delineates these karst regions
and identifies areas ``having a high probability of suitable habitat for endangered or other endemic invertebrate
cave fauna.'' A letter from Veni in response to the petition clarifies that he did not intend that his work be interpreted
to mean that there are thousands of acres of habitat suitable for the karst invertebrates (George Veni, Veni and Associates,

While the Service believes that the karst invertebrates are likely to use interstitial spaces in the karst, particularly
in areas with some surface nutrient input to the karst system, the Service does not believe that this suitable habitat
exists uniformly within the larger karst regions (as delineated by Veni (1992) and described by the Service in the
final rule as ``islands''). Finally, Crawford (1981) focuses on aquatic karst species. In the aquatic karst ecosystems
upon which Crawford based his ideas, continuously flowing water through caves and the interstitium may provide more
continuous habitat for aquatic subterranean species and thus provide more opportunity for aquatic invertebrates
to inhabit interstitial spaces. Given that the Travis and Williamson County karst invertebrates are exclusively
terrestrial and that habitat for terrestrial species is more patchy and distributed according to the occurrence
of food, cover, and moisture, Crawford's ideas may not apply to these invertebrates.

The petitioners cite the work of Curl (1966), Juberthei and Delay (1981), and Culver (1986) as evidence that most caves
have no entrance, that caves are rare even in karst areas, and that caves may be less favorable environments for karst
invertebrates than interstitial spaces. They cite these papers as evidence that habitat for terrestrial troglobites
(obligate cave-dwelling species) is ubiquitous in karst areas and that the Texas karst invertebrates exist throughout
the karst even where there are no caves or openings to the surface. Culver (1986) says that ``the number of caves (defined
as cavities large enough for human access) more or less corresponds to the number of habitable patches for terrestrial
troglobites.'' Reddell (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993) and Peck (1976) believe that cave entrances provide an important avenue of nutrient input for cave fauna. Reddell
(

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993) also cites several examples in which sub-surface voids having no natural entrance were encountered during
construction activities and found not to contain karst invertebrates. Similarly, clay-filled sinkholes with no
openings to the surface rarely contain karst invertebrates, whereas caves and sinkholes that are sealed to human
access by soil or rock fill or with openings to the surface that allow access by cave crickets or small mammals (and associated
nutrients) more often contain karst fauna (Reddell,

No threat from overutilization of these species is known to exist at this time. Collection for scientific or educational

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the time of listing, predation by and competition with non-native species introduced in association with human
habitation was considered a potential threat to the karst invertebrates. Human activities facilitate movement
of non-native competitors and predators such as sowbugs, cockroaches, and fire ants into an area. Buildings, lawns,
roadways, and landscaped areas provide habitat from which these species can disperse. The relative accessibility
of the shallow caves in Travis and Williamson counties makes them especially vulnerable to invasion by non-native
species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fire ants are a major threat to the karst invertebrates. The significance of this threat and the difficulty of controlling
fire ants should not be underestimated. Fire ants are voracious predators and there is evidence that overall arthropod
diversity drops in their presence (Vinson and Sorensen 1986, Porter and Savignano 1990). Reddell (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993) lists at least nine cave-inhabiting species that he has observed being preyed upon by fire ants. Elliott (1992)
cites other examples and notes that fire ant activity has increased dramatically in Central Texas since 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the threat posed by fire ants was not recognized at the time these species were listed, the magnitude of the
threat the ants pose has subsequently become quite apparent. Even in the unlikely event that fire ants do not prey upon
the listed species, their presence in and around caves could have a drastic detrimental effect on the cave ecosystem
through loss of species, inside the cave and out, that provide nutrient input and critical links in the food chain.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Controlling fire ants once they have invaded the cave and vicinity is difficult. Chemical control methods have some
effectiveness but the effect of these agents on non-target species is unclear. Consequently, using chemicals to
control fire ants in and near caves is not advisable. Currently, the Service recommends only boiling water treatment
for control of fire ant colonies near caves inhabited by listed invertebrates. This method is labor-intensive and
only moderately effective. Presently, the burden of carrying out such practices is not a designated or mandated duty
of any agency, individual, or organization. This type of control will likely be needed indefinitely or until a long-term
method of fire ant control is developed.

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Invertebrates are not included on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's list of threatened and endangered species
and are provided no protection by the State; nor do the Department regulations contain provisions for protecting
habitat of any listed species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, some of the caves containing endangered invertebrates are in TSNL and city preserves. A
small preserve surrounds the entrance to each of these caves. However, these preserves encompass only a fraction
of the surface drainage area that provides input of nutrients and moisture into the caves. The entire surface and subsurface
drainage area is the minimum area believed necessary to provide adequate long-term protection for cave ecosystems.
The preserves around these caves are not sufficient to counter nutrient depletion and prevent pollution, should
the surrounding areas be developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the TSNL caves are under temporary deed to TSNL and may be sold at the owner's discretion (U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service 1993). In addition, City of Austin cave protection laws do not apply in most cases, since the great majority
of these caves lie outside the city limits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service is unaware of other threats to these species beyond those discussed under factors A&hyph;D (above). As
noted under Factor A, the Bone Cave harvestman exhibits considerable geographical variation. Loss of a number of
locations within any one part of its range would result in a loss of genetic diversity for the species (Reddell, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993). The Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion, Tooth Cave spider, Coffin Cave and Kretschmarr Cave mold beetles, and Bee
Creek Cave harvestman are each known from fewer than 10 locations (4, 4, 5, 4, and 6 locations respectively, including
unconfirmed identifications). Therefore, the loss of even a single location would represent a significant loss
of genetic diversity for any of those species. Lack of genetic diversity can accelerate the decline or extinction
of rare species.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the final rule, these species remain extremely vulnerable to losses. For the Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion,
the Tooth Cave spider, the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle, the Coffin Cave mold beetle, and the Bee Creek Cave harvestman,
neither the range nor the number of confirmed localities within the range has expanded significantly since the original
listing. The Tooth cave ground beetle and the Bone Cave harvestman occur in more locations and are more widespread
than was originally believed, but the expansion of the overall range is not significant and the majority of caves in
which these species occur are subject to one or more of the threats discussed above (Reddell, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service recently released a Draft Recovery Plan for the karst invertebrates (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993).
That document details recovery actions and criteria that, when met, may result in reclassification or delisting
of the endangered karst invertebrates. Continued efforts to locate new inhabited caves, to implement habitat conservation
measures, and to control the threat of fire ants could bring the karst invertebrates to the point where protection
under the Act is no longer necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the information presented in the petition, as well as the best and most current
scientific and commercial information, in determining that the petition does not present substantial scientific
and commercial information indicating that delisting of any of the seven karst invertebrates may be warranted. These
species continue to require the protection provided by the Act because of their extremely small, vulnerable, and
limited habitats located within an area that is experiencing continued pressures from economic and population growth.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) herein proposes to amend the Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program
(Program) regulations. The Service plans to add Texas and Maryland (beginning with the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season)
to the list of participating States, and to implement some additional modifications to the Program. This regulatory
action will require that licensed hunters in all participating States have evidence of current participation in
the Program on their person while hunting migratory game birds. The quality and extent of information about harvests
of migratory game birds must be improved in order to better manage these populations. Hunters' names and addresses
are necessary to provide a sampling frame for a voluntary hunter survey to improve harvest estimates for all migratory
game birds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this rule is to expand the Harvest Information Program (Program) to include the States of Texas and Maryland
beginning in the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season, and to make minor modifications to the Program. One such modification
is proposed to limit the requirement for participation to only State-licensed migratory bird hunters. Another modification
would require compliance with the Program in each State in which an individual hunts migratory game birds.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice of intent to establish the Program was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 24, 1991. The proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 10, 1992. State wildlife agencies expressed a number of concerns in response to the proposed rule. The majority
of comments were positive and constructive in nature. However, many States were severely disappointed that the sole
remaining option placed the major cost burden on the State wildlife agency. The identification of licensed migratory
bird hunters and the collection of names, addresses and other information from them would be the State's responsibility
and represents the major portion of the cost burden; while conduct of the harvest survey would be a Federal responsibility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many States would have preferred the opportunity of using a separate Federal permit card. A State/Federal technical
working group is continuing to develop procedures that would improve harvest estimates without placing unnecessary
burdens on State agencies, license vendors or the hunters. Alternative survey designs continue to be investigated.
Specifically, alternative survey methods for special groups of unlicensed hunters (e.g., junior and senior hunters)
are being investigated to determine if any resulting biases in the estimates would compromise the quality of the survey
and if other procedures could be developed that would conform to accepted statistical standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 19, 1993. The effect of that final rule was to establish the Program and implement the pilot phase in three States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of Pilot Phase
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State wildlife agencies and the Service began implementing and studying the Program in 1992 with a 2&hyph;year pilot
phase in three volunteer States (California, Missouri, and South Dakota). These States are providing the names and
addresses of migratory bird hunters and other necessary information, from which the Service is conducting a national
Migratory Bird Harvest Survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pilot phase of the Program is being preliminarily evaluated to determine the adequacy and timeliness of the sample
and the time burden, cost, and other impacts on hunters, State license agents, State wildlife agencies, and the Service.
The approaches used in different States are being compared for costs, efficiency, convenience and survey performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service previously stated that after evaluation in 1994 of this pilot phase and consideration of any proposed
changes, other States will be phased into the Program until all States will participate in 1998. The suggested schedule
was published in the June 10, 1992, proposed rule. Consistent with that schedule, Texas will participate in the Program
beginning in 1994. Maryland has requested to participate in the Program earlier than scheduled. Revision of the implementation
schedule is being proposed in this rulemaking document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Description of Program (1992&hyph;1994)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, all migratory game bird hunters in participating States are required to have a Program validation indicating
that they have provided their names and addresses to the State wildlife agency. Validations are printed on their annual
State hunting license or supplementary permit. The State may charge hunters a small handling fee to compensate agents
and to cover the State's administrative costs associated with conducting this Program. Individual migratory bird
hunters are not required to obtain evidence of Program participation in more than one State per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The names, current addresses, and necessary information for an adequate sample of migratory bird hunters are needed
in time for hunting-record forms to be distributed to selected hunters before they forget the details of their hunts.
Because of this fundamental need, States have only a short time to obtain hunter names and addresses from license vendors
and to provide those names and addresses to the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Modifications to the Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to implementation of the Program in Texas and Maryland, the Service is proposing several other modifications
to the Program. One such modification would require persons who hunt migratory game birds in more than one State to
identify themselves as migratory game bird hunters and provide their names, addresses, and dates of birth to each
State in which they hunt migratory game birds. Currently, individual hunters are not required to participate in more
than one State per year; however, hunters must still adhere to the licensing requirements of all individual States
in which they hunt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another modification being proposed is to exempt hunters from a permit requirement if they are also exempt from State-licensing
requirements. This would include several categories of hunters such as junior hunters, senior hunters, landowners,
and other special categories. These exemptions vary on a State-by-State basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Excluding those hunters who are not required to obtain an annual State hunting license from the Program also excludes
their harvest from the estimates. The importance of their harvest depends on how many hunters are excluded and on the
number of birds they bag. Excluding these hunters may result in serious bias. Therefore, the Service is currently
evaluating the effects of excluding these hunters and would appreciate any information that may be available. Minimum
survey standards are also being developed for exempt categories. One suggestion is to allow a class of hunters to be
excluded from participating in the Program if 1) it is periodically demonstrated that only minimal bias in the estimates
results from their exclusion or 2) a statistically sound alternate sampling procedure is implemented. States entering
the program will individually address the effects of exempting unlicensed hunters through a cooperative agreement
with the Service.

Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 14, 1991, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks concluded that the rule would not have a significant
effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 USC 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule will eventually affect about 3&hyph;5 million migratory game bird hunters when it is fully implemented.
It will require licensed migratory game bird hunters to identify themselves and to supply their names, addresses,
and birth dates. Additional information will be requested in order that they can be efficiently sampled for a voluntary
national harvest survey. Hunters will be required to have evidence of current participation in the Program on their
person while hunting migratory game birds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States may require a small handling fee to compensate their hunting-license vendors and to cover their administrative
costs. Many of the State hunting-license vendors are small entities, but this rule should not economically impact
those vendors. Only migratory game bird hunters, individuals, would be required to provide this information, so
this rule should not adversely affect small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection of information contained in this rule has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under
44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and assigned clearance number 1018&hyph;0015. The information is required from licensed hunters to obtain the benefit
of hunting migratory game birds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 0.015 hours per response,
including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the
data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Comments regarding the burden estimate
or any other aspect of these reporting requirements should be directed to the Service Information Collection Clearance
Officer, ms 224_ARLSQ, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240, or the Office of Management
and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 1018&hyph;0015, Washington, DC 20503.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations do not have significant federalism effects as provided in Executive Order 12612. Due to the migratory
nature of certain species of birds, the Federal Government has been given responsibility over these species by the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act. State harvest surveys presently cannot provide adequate national estimates of migratory
game bird harvests for the following reasons: Some States do not now conduct annual harvest surveys or maintain accessible
lists of hunter names and addresses. Comparable information is not available from all States because States have
different licensing laws regulating who must buy a hunting license and different survey procedures. Currently,
many State license lists are not available in time to permit distribution of hunter records early in the hunting season.
Budget constraints often prevent States from conducting harvest surveys during certain years or could cause some
States to eliminate them completely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rules do not have a substantial direct effect on fiscal capacity, change the roles or responsibilities of Federal
or State Governments, or intrude on State policy or administration. Therefore, these regulations do not have significant
federalism effects and do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. In fact, the Service would cooperate with States in providing special surveys to meet mutual management
needs, and increased cooperation between Federal and State agencies would reduce duplication of survey efforts.

Executive Order 12360 discussed guidelines for the taking of individual property rights. These rules, authorized

not result in the physical occupancy of property, the physical invasion of property, or the regulatory taking of any
property.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a proposed rule to set forth agency policies and requirements and
to provide administrative procedures, information, and guidance for those sections of the Prescription Drug Marketing
Act of 1987 (PDMA), as modified by the Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 (PDA), that were not implemented by the
final rule that set forth Federal guidelines for State licensing of wholesale drug distributors (55 FR 38012, September
14, 1990). FDA is also proposing to amend the definitions section of the State licensing guidelines to make the definition
of ``wholesale distribution'' consistent with that in this proposed regulation.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 22, 1988, the President signed PDMA into law (Pub. L. 100&hyph;293). According to the congressional findings
that were made part of the text of PDMA as section 2, the legislation was intended to ensure that drug products purchased
by consumers would be safe and effective and to avoid an unacceptable risk that counterfeit, adulterated, misbranded,
subpotent, or expired drugs were being sold to American consumers. (See sec. 2(8), PDMA.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress found, among other things, that legislation was necessary because there were insufficient safeguards
in the drug distribution system to prevent the introduction and retail sale of substandard, ineffective, or counterfeit
drugs, and that a wholesale drug diversion submarket had developed that prevented effective control over, or even
routine knowledge of, the true sources of drugs. (See secs. 2(2) and 2(3), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress found that large amounts of drugs had been reimported into the United States as American goods returned,
causing a health and safety risk to American consumers because the drugs may have become subpotent or adulterated
during foreign handling and shipping. Congress also found that a ready market for prescription drug reimports had
been the catalyst for a continuing series of frauds against American manufacturers and had provided the cover for
the importation of foreign counterfeit drugs. (See sec. 2(4), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The congressional findings stated that the then-existing system of providing drug samples to physicians through
manufacturers' representatives had been abused for decades and had resulted in the sale to consumers of misbranded,
expired, and adulterated pharmaceuticals. (See sec. 2(6), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the congressional findings, the bulk resale of below-wholesale-priced prescription drugs by health
care entities for ultimate sale at retail helped to fuel the diversion market and was an unfair form of competition
to wholesalers and retailers who had to pay otherwise prevailing market prices. (See sec. 2(7), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDMA amends sections 301, 303, 503, and 801 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 331, 333,
353, 381) to: (1) Ban the reimportation of prescription human drugs produced in the United States, except when reimported
by the manufacturer or under FDA authorization for emergency medical care; (2) ban the sale, purchase, or trade, or
the offer to sell, purchase, or trade, of any drug sample; (3) ban the sale, purchase, or trade, or the offer to sell,
purchase, or trade, or counterfeit any drug coupon; (4) establish limits on the distribution of drug samples to practitioners
licensed to prescribe such drugs or to pharmacies of hospitals or other health care entities, including a requirement
that such distributions occur only at the request of a licensed practitioner; (5) require licensed practitioners
to request samples in writing; (6) mandate storage, handling, and recordkeeping requirements for drug samples;
(7) prohibit, with certain exceptions, the sale, purchase, or trade, or the offer to sell, purchase, or trade, of prescription
human drugs that were purchased by hospitals or other health care entities, or which were donated or supplied at a reduced
price to a charitable organization; (8) require State licensing of wholesale distributors of prescription drugs
under Federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling, and recordkeeping; (9) require
unauthorized wholesale distributors to provide to each wholesale distributor a statement identifying each sale
of the drug before the sale to such wholesale distributor; and (10) set forth civil and criminal penalties for violations
of these provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most PDMA provisions became effective July 22, 1988. However, the drug sample distribution requirements (section
503(d) of the act (21 U.S.C. 353(d))) became effective on October 20, 1988, and the requirement for State licensure
of wholesale distributors (section 503(e)(2) of the act) became effective on September 15, 1992 (2 years after the
adoption of final rules by the agency setting standards for State licensing). In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 13, 1988 (53 FR 35325), FDA published proposed State licensing guidelines to implement that part of PDMA.
FDA received approximately 50 comments on the proposal. These comments were made part of a public docket (Docket No.
88N&hyph;0258), which is available for inspection at FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above). After considering
all the comments received on the proposed rule, FDA published revised State licensing guidelines as a final rule (21
CFR part 205) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 14, 1990 (55 FR 38012). That rule includes minimum requirements for storage and handling of prescription
drugs and for establishment and maintenance of records of drug distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PDMA State licensing requirements were modified by the enactment of PDA (Pub. L. 102&hyph;353, 106 Stat. 941)
on August 26, 1992. Among other things, PDA amended section 503(e) of the act to establish a temporary Federal wholesale
distributor registration procedure for wholesale drug distributors in those States that do not have a licensing
program that meets the Federal guidelines. On September 3, 1992, FDA issued a letter to industry and other interested
persons providing information and guidance on the procedure to be followed by wholesale distributors required to
register under the procedure established by PDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDA also recast other parts of PDMA. Among other things, PDA: (1) Amended section 303(b)(1) of the act to establish
a scienter requirement (``knowingly'') for conviction of violations of certain prohibited acts under section 301(t)
of the act relating to reimportation (section 801(d)(1) of the act), samples (section 503(c)(1) of the act), coupons
(503(c)(2) of the act), and unlicensed wholesale distributors (section 503(e)(2)(A) of the act); (2) amended section
503(d) of the act to prohibit the distribution of drug samples by anyone other than the manufacturer or authorized
distributors of record, except that Congress excluded from the term ``distribute'' the provision of a drug sample
to a patient by a licensed practitioner, health care professional acting at the direction and under the supervision
of such a practitioner, and a hospital or health care entity pharmacy acting at the direction of such a practitioner;
(3) amended section 503(d)(2) and (d)(3) of the act to disallow any distribution of drug samples by unauthorized distributors;
(4) amended section 503(e)(1) of the act to require that unauthorized distributors provide a statement of origin
identifying all prior sales, purchases, or trades of such drugs and the names and addresses of the parties to the transactions
to all recipients; and (5) made certain conforming and technical changes to the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 1 and November 3, 1988, and January 26, 1990, FDA issued letters to the regulated industry and other interested
persons providing information and guidance on those aspects of PDMA that were not implemented by the State licensing
rule. The letters requested suggestions from the public regarding the drafting of regulations. Suggestions from
the public have been made part of a public docket (Docket No. 88N&hyph;258L), which is also available for inspection
at FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above). The agency has received requests for the issuance of further
guidance letters to provide specific information in certain areas or to answer particular questions. However, FDA
believes that it is now appropriate to establish definitive requirements through notice and comment rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In drafting this proposed rule, the agency considered the comments submitted to Docket Nos. 88N&hyph;0258 and 88N&hyph;258L,
including suggestions received in response to FDA's three guidance letters, pertinent comments received in response
to the proposed rule on State licensing of wholesale distributors, and other written submissions.

II. Description of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to add a new part 203 to set forth agency policies and requirements and to provide administrative procedures,
information, and guidance for those sections of PDMA that were not implemented by part 205. FDA is also proposing to
amend &sect;205.3 to make the definition of ``wholesale distribution'' consistent with that in proposed part 203.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A summary of the provisions of proposed part 203 follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It was intended that PDMA would protect the public against the threat of subpotent, adulterated, counterfeit, and
misbranded drugs posed by the existence of drug diversion schemes and a drug diversion submarket, and the absence
of appropriate controls over and creation and maintenance of appropriate records regarding the distribution of
prescription drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the scope of the proposed rule, as set forth in proposed &sect;203.1, includes establishment of procedures
and requirements pertaining to the reimportation and wholesale distribution of prescription drugs; the sale, purchase,
or trade (or the offer to sell, purchase, or trade) of prescription drugs by hospitals, health care entities, and charitable
institutions; and the distribution of prescription drug samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Bulk Drugs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some questions have been raised about the applicability of PDMA to bulk drugs. The statutory language of PDMA encompasses
all drugs subject to section 503(b) of the act within its scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history (``Report of the Committee on Energy and Commerce,'' H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, April 30, 1987,
and ``Report of the Committee on Finance,'' S. Rept. 100&hyph;202, March 18, 1988) or the congressional hearing record
do not suggest that bulk drug substances be treated any differently from other prescription drugs. Bulk drug substances
are susceptible to the same problems of lack of accountability and diversion that this legislation was intended to
remedy. It is clear that applying the provisions of the statute to bulk drug substances would help protect against
the abuses that Congress intended to address and contribute to the protection of the public health. Accordingly,
bulk drug substances are, as drugs within the meaning of section 503(b) of the act, expressly brought within the scope
of PDMA and these implementing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Biological Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions have also been raised about the applicability of PDMA to biological products, even though the statutory
language of PDMA encompasses all drugs subject to section 503(b) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is nothing in the legislative history or the congressional hearing record to suggest that biological products
that are prescription drugs under section 503(b) of the act should be treated differently from other prescription
drugs. Biological products, except for blood and blood components intended for transfusion, are susceptible to
the same problems of lack of accountability and diversion that this legislation was intended to remedy. It is clear
that applying the provisions of the statute to biological products, except for blood and blood components intended
for transfusion, or biological products which are also medical devices, would help protect against the abuses that
Congress intended to address and contribute to the protection of the public health. Accordingly, biological products
that are prescription drugs under section 503(b) of the act, except for blood and blood components intended for transfusion,
fall under the scope of PDMA and are expressly included in these implementing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since passage of PDMA, a number of persons have presented to FDA issues posed by the application of PDMA to the distribution
and sale of blood and blood components intended for transfusion by blood establishments and hospitals. Two comments
to the agency requested clarification of PDMA's scope and urged FDA to exempt blood establishments from all of PDMA's
provisions. The comments contended that licensing blood distributors as wholesalers would seriously disrupt the
Nation's blood services. A third comment suggested that the agency could, by notice and comment rulemaking, exempt
blood and blood components from PDMA by declaring that they are not prescription drugs for PDMA purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDMA, by its literal terms, applies to all drugs that are subject to section 503(b) of the act; that is, to all human prescription
drugs, including biological products. There is no doubt that blood and blood components intended for transfusion
are prescription drugs. (See 21 CFR 606.121(c)(8)(i) and 610.61(s). See also 47 FR 22518, May 25, 1982; 46 FR 40212,
August 7, 1981.) However, if PDMA were considered applicable to the distribution of blood and blood components, the
result would be to impede the existing blood distribution system, thereby interfering with our Nation's blood supply.
Because application of PDMA to blood and blood components would produce this untenable result, FDA believes that
Congress could not have intended to subject blood and blood components to PDMA's provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the legislative history lacks any discussion of PDMA's application to blood and blood components and also
clearly shows that Congress intended that PDMA remedy problems associated with the distribution of those drugs that
are popularly referred to as ``medicines'' or ``pharmaceuticals.'' (See Pub. L. 100&hyph;293, sec. 2 (1988) (``Report
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce,'' H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, April 30, 1987, and ``Report of the Committee on Finance,''
S. Rept. 100&hyph;202, March 18, 1988).) Blood and blood components are unique drug products that are distributed
in an entirely different way from other prescription drugs. FDA believes that the fact that blood and blood components
are not part of the system of distribution and marketing that Congress intended to regulate under the terms of PDMA
further signals that Congress could not have intended to include blood and blood components within the scope of the
licensing requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FDA has taken a number of actions to clarify the scope of PDMA to prescription drugs other than blood and
blood components intended for transfusion. In the final State licensing guideline rule (55 FR 38012 at 38024), FDA
specifically excluded from the definition of ``wholesale distribution'' the sale, purchase, or trade of blood and
blood components intended for transfusion (see &sect;205.3(f)(8)). At the same time, FDA published another proposed
rule, ``Applicability to Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion; Guidelines for State Licensing of
Wholesale Prescription Drug Distributors'' (55 FR 38027, September 14, 1990), asking for comments on the exclusion
of blood and blood components intended for transfusion from the PDMA State licensing guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments received and reviewing PDMA's purpose and its legislative history, FDA has tentatively
concluded that PDMA is not intended to apply to blood and blood components intended for transfusion. Accordingly,
at &sect;203.1 the proposed rule would exclude blood and blood components intended for transfusion from the requirements
of and the restrictions in PDMA and also adds specific language at &sect;203.22(g) excluding blood and blood components
intended for transfusion from the PDMA sales restrictions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Oxygen
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions have also been raised about the applicability of PDMA to the drug oxygen, U.S.P. (U.S. Pharmacopeia). FDA
advises that oxygen, U.S.P., is a prescription drug subject to section 503(b) of the act, and, therefore, within the
scope of PDMA and these proposed regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Reimportation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 801(d) of the act (21 U.S.C. 381(d)) provides that a prescription drug that is manufactured in a State and exported
may not be reimported into the United States unless it is imported by the manufacturer, except when authorized by the
Secretary of Health and Human Services for emergency medical care. The delegation of authority provisions at 21 CFR
5.10 redelegate the functions of the Secretary to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 801(d) of the act responds to a finding that large amounts of drugs were being reimported into the United States
as ``American Goods Returned,'' and that these imports posed a health and safety risk to American consumers because
they could become subpotent or adulterated during foreign handling and shipping. (See sec. 2(4), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The congressional findings also acknowledged that what was termed ``the ready market for prescription drug reimports''
was ``the catalyst for a continuing series of frauds against American manufacturers and has provided the cover for
the importation of foreign counterfeit drugs.'' (See sec. 2(5), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Restrictions on Reimportation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;203.10 sets forth the restriction that no prescription drug manufactured in a State and exported
from the United States may be reimported by anyone other than its manufacturer, except that FDA may grant permission
to a person other than the manufacturer to reimport a prescription drug if it deems such reimportation is required
for emergency medical care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Defining ``Manufacturer''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA defined the term ``manufacturer'' in the PDMA State licensing regulation to mean anyone engaged in manufacturing,
preparing, propagating, compounding, processing, packaging, repackaging, or labeling of a prescription drug
(&sect;205.3(d)). This definition is somewhat more inclusive than the definition used earlier by the agency in the
labeling provisions at &sect;201.1 (21 CFR 201.1). The definition in &sect;201.1(b) states that the manufacturer
is the person who performs all of the following operations that are required to produce the product: (1) Mixing, (2)
granulating, (3) milling, (4) molding, (5) lyophilizing, (6) tableting, (7) encapsulating, (8) coating, (9) sterilizing,
and (10) filling sterile, aerosol, or gaseous drugs into dispensing containers; or at least some of the operations
if the labeling indicates the presence of other manufacturers. Under &sect;201.1, a packer or distributor is not
the same as a manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA concluded that the more inclusive definition of ``manufacturer'' was consistent with the intent of the statute
in imposing the requirement for State licensing of wholesale drug distributors; however, the agency has preliminarily
concluded that a less inclusive definition of that term would be more consistent with the intent of the remaining sections
of PDMA. For example, the statutory provision against reimportation by persons other than the manufacturer (except
when permission is granted by FDA) is intended to establish accountability in reimportations so that adulterated
and/or misbranded goods do not reenter commercial channels in the United States. The reimportation provision is
based on the assumption that a manufacturer, in the less inclusive sense, is the person most knowledgeable about the
product's characteristics; is the most capable of determining that the product meets the stability, quality, and
purity standards it is represented to possess; and is the only person capable of authenticating the basic integrity
of the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining sections of PDMA are consistent with the less inclusive definition of ``manufacturer'' in &sect;201.1,
rather than the more inclusive definition in &sect;205.3(d). Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.3(p) proposes to
adopt the definition of ``manufacturer'' in &sect;201.1 for this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Applications for Reimportation to Provide Emergency Medical Care
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.11 provides an administrative procedure by which applications may be made by a person other than
the manufacturer for the reimportation of prescription drugs for emergency medical care. The proposal would codify
the current procedure whereby applications for reimportation are submitted to the Director of the FDA District Office
in the district where reimportation is sought. The District Office would review and approve or disapprove each application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. An Appeal From an Adverse Decision by the District Office
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;203.12 would also codify the current procedure that permits an appeal from an adverse decision by
the district office to be made to the Office of Compliance (HFD&hyph;300), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research,
for prescription human drugs other than biological products. An appeal from an adverse decision involving human
prescription biological products is to be made to the Office of Compliance (HFM&hyph;600), Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Sales Restrictions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503(c)(3) of the act prohibits, with certain exceptions, the sale, purchase, or trade (or any offer to sell,
purchase, or trade) of any prescription drug that was purchased by a public or private hospital or other health care
entity, or donated or supplied at a reduced price to a charitable organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Defining ``Charitable Organization''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code generally exempts from income taxes not-for-profit organizations
that operate for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, educational, and public safety purposes. However,
such exemptions are not automatic. Under 26 CFR 1.501, a charitable organization must apply for and be granted tax-exempt
status. Tax-exempt status may be revoked and the organization may lose its exemption if it fails to meet the requirements
of the statute and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is FDA's view that an organization can be accurately described as one fitting the requirements of section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code only if it has been granted tax-exempt status by the Department of the Treasury. Accordingly,
FDA proposes to define the term ``charitable organization'' in proposed &sect;203.3(f) as a nonprofit hospital,
health care entity, organization, institution, foundation, association, or corporation that has been granted
an exemption under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Restrictions and Exclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;203.20 restates the statutory restrictions on prescription drug sales by hospitals, health care
entities, and charitable institutions (section 503(c)(3) of the act). These restrictions reflect a congressional
finding that the resale of prescription drugs by health care entities at below wholesale prices had helped to fuel
the drug diversion market and that such sales constituted an unfair form of competition to legitimate wholesalers
and retailers paying the prevailing market prices. (See sec. 2(7), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute does not distinguish sales made at the average wholesale price (AWP) and those made at below AWP or at more
than the AWP. The sales restrictions apply to all sales, purchases, or trades by hospitals, health care entities,
and charitable institutions. Sales of any human prescription drugs purchased by a hospital or other health care entity,
or donated or supplied at reduced cost to a charitable institution, are prohibited unless excepted by section 503(c)(3)(B)
of the act or exempted under proposed &sect;&sect;203.22, 203.23, or 203.24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its findings, Congress stated that it believed that these resales had helped to create an unacceptable risk that
counterfeit, adulterated, misbranded, subpotent, or expired drugs would be sold to American consumers. (See sec.
2(8), PDMA.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution cannot be wholesaler
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. FDA has learned that some hospitals and health care entities, including physicians, have obtained licenses as wholesale
distributors in an effort to circumvent the statutory restrictions against the sale of prescription drugs by hospitals,
health care entities, and charitable institutions. Those hospitals and health care entities that have secured wholesale
drug distributor licenses claim that the statutory restrictions are made inapplicable to them by the first clause
of the last sentence of section 503(c)(3) of the act, which reads: ``For purposes of this paragraph, the term `entity'
does not include a wholesale distributor of drugs or a retail pharmacy licensed under State law * * *.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a reading is inconsistent not only with general rules of statutory construction, but with the intent of Congress
as reflected in the legislative history. The legislative history, which addresses Congress' concern about donations
to charitable institutions and institutional discounts for hospitals and health care entities, notes that some
of these institutions had been sources of unfair competition and drug diversion, and explains that the statutory
prohibition against the sale of drugs donated to or acquired at reduced price by charitable institutions or purchased
by hospitals or health care entities is directed at preventing unfair profits through resales of such drugs. Congress
said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503(c)(3) would prohibit resales of pharmaceuticals by hospitals and other health care entities or charitable
organizations with certain exceptions. This provision is intended to cover resales by both for profit and nonprofit
health care entities. These institutions typically receive discount prices, substantially below the average wholesale
price (AWP) for pharmaceuticals, based on their status as a health care entity or charity. When hospitals or other
health care entities obtain pharmaceuticals at favorable prices and then resell those drugs at a profit, they are
unfairly competing with wholesalers and retailers who cannot obtain such a favorable price. Such resales defraud
manufacturers, who are led to believe that the drugs are for the use of the health care entity. In any case, these resales
reward the unscrupulous and penalize the otherwise honest and efficient wholesaler or retailer while fueling the
diversion market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA interprets the first clause of the last sentence of section 503(c)(3) of the act to mean that the general prohibition
against drug sales by hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions was not intended to interfere
with the operations of legitimate licensed prescription drug wholesalers and retail pharmacies. Section 503(c)(3)
of the act does not open up a loophole for a hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution to avoid the statutory
prohibition against drug sales simply by obtaining a wholesaler license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.3(n) would state that a person cannot simultaneously be a ``health care entity''
and a retail pharmacy or wholesale distributor. The agency is also proposing to amend the State licensing guidelines
by adopting the same definition for ``health care entity'' at &sect;205.3(h). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a charitable institution or a for-profit or nonprofit hospital or health care entity has a corporate for-profit
subsidiary that is a wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy, or if it is part of a group in which there is common control
over the hospital or health care entity and a wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy, then the charitable institution,
hospital, or health care entity would be prohibited under section 503(c)(3) of the act and proposed &sect;&sect;203.20
and 203.22 from transferring any prescription drug donated or supplied at reduced price to the charitable institution
or purchased by the hospital or health care entity to the related wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy for further
sale except for a sale under a valid prescription or for emergency medical reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A charitable institution, hospital, or health care entity that has a wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy subsidiary,
or one that is part of a group in which there is common control over the charitable institution, hospital, or health
care entity and a wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy, should maintain books and records that provide sufficient
audit trails to trace the purchase and sale of prescription drugs to ensure that no prescription drug donated or supplied
at reduced price to the charitable institution or purchased by the hospital or health care entity is transferred to
a related wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy for further sale except for a sale under a valid prescription or
for emergency medical reasons.

Statutory exclusions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Proposed &sect;203.22 restates the statutory exclusions to the sales restrictions. They are: (1) The purchase
or other acquisition of a drug for its own use by a hospital or other health care entity that is a member of a group purchasing
organization from the group purchasing organization or from other hospitals or health care entities that are members
of the organization; (2) the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug or an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug by a charitable
organization to a nonprofit affiliate of the organization to the extent otherwise permitted by law; (3) the sale,
purchase, or trade of a drug or an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug among hospitals or other health care entities
that are under common control; (4) the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug or an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug
for emergency medical reasons; or (5) the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug, an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug,
or the dispensing of a drug under a valid prescription.

c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Common control
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. One statutory exclusion to the general prohibition against resale of drugs by hospitals, health care entities,
and charitable institutions permits the sale, purchase, or trade of prescription drugs among hospitals and health
care entities that are under common control. There is no statutory definition of the term ``common control,'' nor
is the term mentioned in the legislative history. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concept of common control can be found in other Federal regulatory schemes that were in use at the time PDMA was enacted
into law. Both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency define ``common control''
to mean possession of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person or an organization,
whether by ownership of stock, voting securities or rights, contract, or otherwise. (See 17 CFR 230.405 and 40 CFR
66.3(f).) FDA included this definition in the State licensing guidelines at &sect;205.3(f)(4). This proposal would
adopt the same definition in proposed &sect;203.3(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sales for emergency medical reasons
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 503(c)(3) of the act permits the sale, purchase, or trade of prescription drugs by a hospital, health care
entity, or charitable institution for emergency medical reasons. The statute states that ``emergency medical reasons''
includes transfers of a drug between health care entities or from a health care entity to a retail pharmacy undertaken
to alleviate temporary shortages of the drug arising from delays in or interruptions of regular distribution schedules.
The statute does not further elaborate on the term ``emergency medical reasons.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that it may be useful to specify some of the circumstances in which a sale for emergency medical reasons
would be allowed. (See proposed &sect;203.3(k).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received a significant number of comments from providers of emergency care, including emergency medical services,
ambulance corporations, fire companies, rescue squads, urgent care providers, emergency care physicians and technicians,
and State emergency care agencies and commissions that advised the agency that hospital pharmacies have traditionally
supplied drugs for emergency use by emergency medical services and licensed practitioners' offices operating in
the general service area of the hospital. Several comments stated that wholesale distributors are reluctant to open
small accounts to provide such drugs for emergency care, and that nearby hospital pharmacies are the logical providers.
Moreover, the comments noted that many States encourage hospitals to supply drugs for emergency use to emergency
medical services, and some States require emergency services to acquire their drugs exclusively from hospitals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would allow sale of drugs by a hospital or health care entity to nearby emergency medical services such
as ambulance services, rescue squads, and fire companies in the same State or service or marketing area for use in emergency
treatment and to licensed practitioners for emergency office treatment. The proposal would also define emergency
medical reasons to allow hospitals and health care entities to provide minimal emergency supplies to nursing homes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, FDA believes that the exception for emergency medical reasons does not permit hospitals or health care
entities regularly to sell to licensed practitioners prescription drugs that will be used for routine office procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Government hospitals and health care entities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Proposed &sect;203.22(f) would also exclude the sale, purchase, or trade of prescription drugs by Federal, State,
and local government hospitals and health care entities to other Federal, State, and local government hospitals
or health care entities from the general prohibition against the sale, purchase, or trade of prescription drugs by
a hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress has established an extensive system of public hospitals and health care entities. These include hospitals,
clinics, and dispensaries operated for the military by the Department of Defense; hospitals and clinics operated
by the Veterans' Administration; and hospitals and clinics operated by the U.S. Public Health Service (including
Indian Health Service hospitals and clinics).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, State and local governments have established public health hospitals, clinics, and dispensaries,
including drug treatment inpatient and outpatient facilities. These facilities operate under a variety of organizational
structures. They may be owned and operated by governmental entities, or be organized as private corporations or associations
under contract to State or local government agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These health care entities may have interagency arrangements for the purchase and exchange of prescription drugs.
Such facilities operate because of Federal, State, or local governmental commitments to provide health care to particular
classes of patients in response to specific client needs. Among these needs are the provision of services to people
with low incomes, the distribution of vaccines, and the dispensing of antitoxins and blood derivatives in public
health emergencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted, the adoption of the prohibition against sales by hospitals or health care entities was prompted in part because
of the differential pricing structure that permits purchases by hospitals and health care entities at below wholesale
prices and the resultant temptation to resell drugs so acquired at a profit. However, there is no financial incentive
for a Federal, State, or local government hospital or health care entity to sell prescription drugs purchased at below
wholesale prices because any profit from such a sale would go to the Federal or State treasury. Accordingly, FDA believes
that there is little likelihood that permitting Federal, State, or local government hospitals and health care entities
to sell prescription drugs to other Federal, State, or local government hospitals and health care entities would
lead to the kinds of abuses that PDMA was designed to end.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, proposed &sect;203.22(f) would exclude such transactions from the general prohibition against resales
by hospitals and health care entities and thus permit Federal, State, or local government hospitals and health care
entities to sell drugs to other Federal, State, or local government hospitals and health care entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has been asked whether a State or local government agency, which, under a contract or memorandum of agreement,
sends or allows some of its patients to be treated at a private local clinic or other health care entity, may transfer
prescription drug products to such a facility to be dispensed to patients. In other words, would such a transfer violate
the prohibition against the sale, purchase, or trade of prescription drugs by a hospital, health care entity, or charitable
institution?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that if a State or local government agency functions as or operates a hospital, health care entity, or charitable
institution, and a private health care entity is bound by a contractual agreement to the State or local government
agency, then the State or local government hospital or health care entity may sell prescription drugs to the contract
private health care entity provided that the prescription drugs sold are only used to serve government patients and
programs. The State or local government hospital or health care agency supplying the drug and the contract health
care entity would be obligated to implement appropriate controls to ensure that the drugs sold by the Government hospital
or health care entity to the contract health care entity are dispensed to patients in the Government program and not
diverted or sold to other patients or otherwise used for non-Government purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the State or local government agency does not function as or operate a hospital, health care entity, or charitable
institution, and is acting as a prescription drug wholesaler, the prohibition against the sale of prescription drugs
by a hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution would not be applicable.

3. Revocation of Acceptance, Reshipment, and Returns
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA proposes to clarify the circumstances under which hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions
may, without violating section 503(c)(3) of the act, return or ship back prescription drugs to the manufacturer or
distributor from which they were purchased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, proposed &sect;&sect;203.23 and 203.24 would, respectively, describe the conditions by which hospitals,
health care entities, and charitable institutions may: (1) Revoke acceptance of any prescription drug received
because of an ordering or delivery mistake and ship them back to the manufacturer or distributor, and (2) return a drug
to the manufacturer or distributor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of persons who submitted comments to the PDMA docket questioned the effect of the new statutory language on
commercial practice in the pharmaceutical industry. Several persons argued that the sales provisions in the Uniform
Commercial Code treat a sale as completed once a nondefective product has been ordered, delivered, and paid for, unless
specific contractual provisions make the sale conditional or revocable. Several persons urged that FDA view a return
for cash or credit after a completed sale as a new and prohibited sales transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, many other comments to the agency in the months after passage of PDMA observed that under common commercial
practice in the pharmaceutical industry, manufacturers and wholesale distributors permit returns and urged that
this practice be allowed to continue. FDA is aware that hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution pharmacies,
and distributors sometimes return products because of overstocks, changes in institutional formularies, the death
of a patient for whose use a drug product was acquired, or other reasons. The comments received by the agency argued
that to permit returns would both help to keep down the costs of medical care and reduce the risk that adulterated or
misbranded drugs would find their way into the diversion market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has tentatively concluded that it should, under specified conditions, allow drug products to be shipped back
or returned to the manufacturer or distributor, and this tentative conclusion is reflected in proposed &sect;&sect;203.23
and 203.24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;203.23, a hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution could revoke a sale and purchase
transaction because of a mistake in ordering or delivery and ship the prescription drug back, provided: (1) The hospital,
health care entity, or charitable institution ships the drug back within 10 working days of receipt; (2) the reshipment
is made under proper storage, handling, and shipping conditions; and (3) if reshipped to the wholesale distributor,
the hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution provides written notice to the manufacturer of the revocation
and reshipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would require that the manufacturer be notified of the reshipment so that any chargebacks to the manufacturer
by the wholesale distributor or special price reduction credited by the manufacturer to the wholesale distributor
would be factored into the credit or refund given the distributor. This is intended to prevent windfall profits from
the return of a specially priced drug to the wholesale distributor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;203.24, a hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution could return a product it
had purchased from a manufacturer or wholesale distributor, provided that: (1) The hospital, health care entity,
or charitable institution notifies the manufacturer that the prescription drug product has been returned to the
wholesale distributor; and (2) the hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution fills out a credit memo.
Proposed &sect;203.24 would require the hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution to send a copy of
the credit memo to the manufacturer, for the same reasons that notification of the manufacturer is required in the
event of a revocation and reshipment, i.e., so that any chargebacks or reduced prices will be factored into any credit
or refund to prevent windfall profits from the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;203.23 and 203.24 would both require detailed documentation to provide the kind of accountability
contemplated by the act to help ensure against diversion. To ensure that returned drugs remain safe and effective,
both proposed sections would require that drugs returned to a manufacturer or wholesale distributor be kept under
proper conditions for storage, handling, and shipping, and that written documentation reflecting the maintenance
of proper conditions be provided to the manufacturer or wholesale distributor to which the drugs are returned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the value of any credit, refund, or merchandise exchanged for the returned product could not exceed
the purchase price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of clarification and to ensure that the State licensing regulation and this proposed rule, when adopted,
are consistent, the agency is also proposing to amend the definitions in the State licensing guidelines at &sect;205.3(f)
by adding two additional exceptions to ``wholesale distribution'' for the reshipment of drugs, when conducted in
accordance with &sect;203.23, and drug returns, when conducted in accordance with &sect;203.24.

D. Samples
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To provide accountability and oversight in the sample distribution process, PDMA established in section 503(d)
of the act a strict system of controls over the distribution of prescription drug samples, which are defined in section
503(c)(1) of the act. Under the statutory scheme, no person could distribute any drug sample, except for a manufacturer
or distributor who distributed drug samples in accordance with specific requirements and in response to a written
request from a licensed practitioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under sections 503(d)(1) and (d)(2) of the act, both manufacturers and distributors could engage in sample distribution
if certain requirements were followed. However, section 4(2) of PDA further restricted the persons who can engage
in distribution of drug samples by amending section 503(d)(1) and (d)(2) of the act to restrict sample distributions
to manufacturers and authorized distributors of record. This amendment is demonstrative of the intent of Congress,
as reflected elsewhere in PDMA and PDA, to restrict the activities of drug distributors who are not authorized distributors
of record. Proposed &sect;&sect;203.30, 203.31, and 203.33 through 203.39 are consistent with this amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised statutory scheme, no person may distribute any drug sample, except for a manufacturer or authorized
distributor of record who distributes drug samples in accordance with specific requirements and in response to a
written request from a licensed practitioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 503(d)(1) of the act states that, for purposes of this subsection, the term ``distribute'' does not include
the providing of a drug sample to a patient by a practitioner licensed to prescribe such drug, by a health care professional
acting at the direction and under the supervision of such a practitioner, or the pharmacy of a hospital or of another
health care entity acting at the direction of such a practitioner who received the drug sample in accordance with the
act and regulations. The definition of ``distribute'' in proposed &sect;203.3(h) reflects this statutory exclusion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDMA sets up two different sample distribution systems, depending on the mode of delivery: (1) By mail or common carrier,
and (2) by means other than mail or common carrier, i.e., representative or detailer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a sample is delivered by mail or common carrier, the statute requires the recipient to execute a written receipt
when the drug sample is delivered and return the receipt to the manufacturer or authorized distributor of record from
which the drug sample was received. If the sample is delivered by a representative, a number of additional procedures
are required by the statute that pertain to storage and handling, inventories, recordkeeping, reporting of thefts
and significant losses, notification of convictions of representatives for drug sample violations, and accountability.
The statute specifies minimum requirements for the contents of written request forms and details certain recordkeeping
and reporting requirements.

1. Requirements for Drug Sample Distribution
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements for distribution of drug samples by manufacturers and authorized distributors of record by mail
or common carrier are set forth in proposed &sect;203.30. The requirements for distribution of drug samples by representatives
are set forth in proposed &sect;203.31. The proposed sections provide detailed requirements for written request
forms, receipts, and recordkeeping.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of these requirements are statutory; however, FDA has tentatively concluded that clarification of some of the
statutory requirements is desirable. FDA also has tentatively concluded that other requirements should be imposed
to help ensure smooth operation of the system, effective enforcement, effective accountability and oversight of
drug sample distribution, and provide adequate safeguards against drug sample diversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Contents of the Sample Request Forms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;203.30 and 203.31 would require the written request form for drug samples to bear certain information:
(1) The name, address, professional title, signature of the practitioner making the request; (2) the practitioner's
State license number or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) identification number; (3) the proprietary or
established name and strength of the drug sample requested; (4) the quantity requested; (5) the name of the manufacturer
of the drug sample and the authorized distributor of record, if the drug sample is requested from a distributor; and
(6) the date of the request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments suggested that it is sometimes difficult for a manufacturer or distributor to determine whether
or not a particular person who wishes to receive drug samples is a licensed practitioner. FDA has added the requirement
that the request form bear the practitioner's State license or DEA identification number to assist the manufacturer
or distributor in determining whether or not a person is a licensed practitioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute requires a request form to bear the ``identity'' of the drug sample being requested. FDA has clarified
the meaning of ``identity'' in the proposed rule by specifying that the request form bear the proprietary or established
name and strength of the requested sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDMA requires that the request form bear the name of the manufacturer of the drug. However, where the statute also permits
an authorized distributor of record to distribute drug samples, the identity is incomplete without naming both the
manufacturer and distributor. In that circumstance, FDA proposes to require that the name of the distributor as well
as the manufacturer be made part of the sample request form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute also permits delivery of a drug sample to the pharmacy of a hospital or other health care entity at the request
of a licensed practitioner. However, the statute does not state how that request for delivery should be made. FDA has
tentatively concluded that the name and address of the intended recipient should be part of the request form. This
conclusion is reflected in the requirements in proposed &sect;&sect;203.30 and 203.31 that, if the request is being
made by a licensed practitioner for delivery of a drug sample to a hospital or health care entity pharmacy, the name
and address of the intended recipient be included on the request form.

3. Drug Sample Receipts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;203.30 and 203.31 would require the execution of a written receipt by the recipient upon delivery
of a drug sample. The proposed sections also set out the contents of the receipt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute requires the execution of a receipt upon delivery of a drug sample by mail or common carrier to establish
an audit trail for drug sample orders and deliveries and to ensure that drug samples ordered are received. The statute
does not require the execution of a written receipt for samples delivered by representatives in the apparent belief
that a representative always delivers a drug sample to a licensed practitioner at the same time that the licensed practitioner
signs the request form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments suggested that samples frequently are not delivered at the time of the request, i.e., some time
elapses between request and delivery, even when a representative personally delivers the drug sample. Sometimes
the period of time is only a few minutes, but often it may be hours, days, or weeks. In some instances, a representative
may receive a request for a drug sample at one sales call and deliver the requested sample at a later date. In these cases,
because of lapses of memory, mistake, or because a diversion scheme may be underway, the samples delivered may not
always match the request. Accordingly, the agency has tentatively concluded that the requirement for a written receipt
should extend to all drug sample deliveries, and that requirement is included in proposed &sect;&sect;203.30 and
203.31.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A sample request and receipt need not be on separate forms if delivery is by a representative. A single form could be
devised and used containing all of the required information, which could be fully completed and executed with a single
signature, if the request and delivery are simultaneous, or executed in part with a signature for the request at the
time of the request, and executed in part with a second signature acknowledging receipt at the time of the delivery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;203.30(c) and 203.31(c) state that a receipt is to be on a form designated by the manufacturer
or distributor. If the drug sample is received by the requesting practitioner, both proposed sections would require
that the receipt contain the name, address, professional title, and signature of the practitioner or the practitioner's
designee who acknowledges delivery of the drug sample; the proprietary or established name and strength of the drug
sample, the quantity, and the lot or control number of the drug sample delivered; and the date of the delivery. If the
drug sample is received by the pharmacy of a hospital or other health care entity at the request of a licensed practitioner,
both proposed sections would require the receipt to contain the name and address of the requesting licensed practitioner,
the name and address of the hospital or health care entity pharmacy designated to receive the drug sample; the name,
address, professional title, and signature of the person acknowledging delivery of the drug sample; the proprietary
or established name and strength of the drug sample, the quantity, and the lot or control number of the drug sample delivered;
and the date of the delivery. FDA believes this information is necessary to ensure that the sample received is the same
as the sample requested.

4. Additional Requirements For Delivery of Drug Samples by Representatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PDMA provides that manufacturers and distributors that utilize representatives for the delivery of drug samples
must abide by a number of additional requirements. These additional requirements are intended to guard against the
kinds of abuses that Congress' findings stated had been an integral part of the drug sample delivery system and had
led to large-scale drug sample diversion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inventories of drug samples of manufacturers' and distributors' representatives
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The statute provides that each drug manufacturer or distributor that engages in drug sample distribution is required
to conduct, at least annually, a complete and accurate inventory of all drug samples in the possession of representatives
(21 U.S.C. 353(d)(3)(C)). The inventory is intended to guard against drug sample diversion by providing manufacturers
and distributors information that will permit them to identify diverters and take appropriate action and provide
data for FDA enforcement activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute does not specify what is meant by such an inventory, nor how it is to be conducted and reported. It is FDA's
preliminary view that such an inventory must go beyond a mere physical count, and that meaningful information and
data can only be provided if the inventory is conducted utilizing generally accepted inventory practices and a reconciliation
report is prepared that relates the latest inventory to the most recent prior inventory and to drug samples acquired
and distributed in the interim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.31(d) would require the manufacturer or distributor to inventory all drug samples
in the possession of a manufacturer's or distributor's representative, and keep a record of the inventory. The record
would be required to identify all drug samples by established or proprietary name, dosage strength, and number of
sample units of each drug sample in stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would require that the manufacturer or distributor reconcile the number of drug samples on hand with
the number received during the reporting period. The reconciliation report would be required to include: (1) A report
of the physical count of the most recently completed prior inventory; (2) a record of each drug sample shipment received
since the most recently completed prior inventory, including the sender and date of the shipment, and the established
or proprietary name, dosage strength, and number of sample units received; (3) a record of drug sample distributions
since the most recently completed inventory showing the name and address of each recipient of each sample unit shipped,
the date of the shipment, and the established or proprietary name, dosage strength, lot or control number, and number
of sample units shipped; and (4) an explanation for any significant loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure impartiality, the proposal would also require that the inventory and reconciliation reports be conducted
and prepared by persons other than the representatives being inventoried or their supervisors or managers in their
direct line of supervision or command.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To guard against drug sample diversion, the proposed section would require manufacturers and distributors to evaluate
carefully any apparent discrepancy or significant loss in the inventory and reconciliation, and to investigate
fully any significant loss that cannot be justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lists of manufacturers' and distributors' representatives
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. PDMA requires that each manufacturer or authorized distributor of record who distributes drug samples maintain
a list of the names and addresses of its representatives who distribute drug samples and of the sites where drug samples
are stored. The proposal restates this statutory requirement (&sect;203.31(e)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notification if representative is convicted of violations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The statute requires drug manufacturers or distributors of record to report to FDA any conviction of a representative
for violations of section 503(c)(1) of the act or a State law because of the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug sample
or the offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug sample. The proposal restates this statutory requirement (&sect;203.31(f)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5. Drug Sample Storage and Handling Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has already excluded the distribution of drug samples by representatives from the definition of ``wholesale
distribution'' in &sect;205.3(f)(7), and the agency is proposing to adopt this exclusion in the definition of ``wholesale
distribution'' in proposed &sect;203.3(y). In view of this, representatives are not required to be licensed as wholesale
distributors by the States. PDMA requires manufacturers and authorized distributors of record to store all drug
samples under conditions that will maintain their stability, integrity, and effectiveness, and ensure that the
drug samples are not contaminated, deteriorated, or otherwise adulterated. Proposed &sect;203.32 reflects this
requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A representative, as an agent of the manufacturer or authorized distributor of record, is bound by the same standard,
and is required to take adequate precautions to ensure the safety and efficacy of any drug samples the representative
distributes. Generally, if a representative follows the labeling and compendial requirements for storage and handling
of a particular prescription drug in handling samples of that drug, the safety and efficacy of the drug sample may be
assured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Drug Sample Forms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of persons posed questions regarding drug sample request and receipt forms. FDA does not contemplate developing
its own forms for sample request and receipt, and instead intends to rely on manufacturers and distributors to develop
appropriate forms. Accordingly, any written request or receipt form developed by a manufacturer or authorized distributor
of record that complies with the requirements of proposed &sect;203.33 would be acceptable to FDA if it contains the
information and any signature required in this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency wishes to encourage transmission and receipt of sample request and receipt forms by the most efficient
and expeditious means. Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.33 would permit such forms to be delivered by mail, common
carrier, or private courier or to be transmitted photographically or electronically (i.e., by telephoto, wirephoto,
radiophoto, facsimile transmission (FAX), xerography, or electronic data transfer) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by any other system, provided that the method for transmission meets the security requirements set forth in proposed
&sect;203.60(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Written Policies and Procedures and Other Requirements for Drug Sample Distribution
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA received a number of questions and comments from drug manufacturers and distributors seeking assistance in developing
appropriate administrative systems for distributing drug samples. There are a wide variety of administrative systems
in use, and enforcement has been complicated by the multiplicity of sample distribution procedures. Although standardization
is not necessary, the agency believes that clear internal administrative systems are essential to ensure that sample
distribution is carried out efficiently and that the statutory requirements are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA expects that manufacturers and distributors will have administrative systems in place to review
all losses and thefts so that patterns that may indicate the possibility of drug sample diversion will be detected.
The agency believes that this is consistent with Congress' intent that manufacturers and distributors develop adequate
audit and security systems to detect and investigate sample losses and thefts. (H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, p. 20; S. Rept.
100&hyph;202, p. 9.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, under proposed &sect;203.34, each manufacturer or authorized distributor of record that distributes
drug samples would be expected to adopt an administrative system to monitor losses and thefts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, proposed &sect;203.34 would require drug manufacturers and distributors to establish, maintain, and adhere
to written policies and procedures describing its administrative systems for sample distribution. The proposed
section contemplates that each manufacturer's or distributor's written policies and procedures would describe
its administrative system for: (1) Distributing drug samples by mail or common carrier, including methodology for
reconciliation of requests and receipts; (2) distributing drug samples by means other than mail or common carrier;
(3) conducting its inventory of drug samples under proposed &sect;203.31(d), including an inventory schedule;
(4) auditing and detecting falsified or incomplete drug sample records; (5) identifying any significant loss of
drug samples and notifying FDA of the loss; (6) monitoring any loss or theft of drug samples; and (7) storing drug samples
by representatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Standing Requests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the House Report and Senate Report state that it is the intent of Congress that separate written requests be made
each time that samples are requested to be delivered and that standing requests do not fulfill the requirements of
the statute, except that the Senate Report states that FDA may provide by regulation for the delivery by mail of a small
number of samples for strictly limited periods of time. (H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, p. 14; S. Rept. 100&hyph;202, p. 6.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.35 would require that separate written requests be made for each sample or group of samples and
does not allow for open-ended or standing requests to order drug samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed section states, however, that the agency does not consider standing requests to include an arrangement
by which a licensed practitioner requests in writing that a specified number of drug samples be delivered over a period
of not more than 6 months, with the actual delivery dates for parts of the order to be set by subsequent communication.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Use of Fulfillment Houses, Shipping and Mailing Services, Other Contractors, and Comarketing Agreements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA understands that some manufacturers and distributors employ third parties to meet some of the requirements imposed
on them under PDMA. Third parties may include contractors such as fulfillment houses (companies that receive and
fill orders), mailing services, and other contractors. In addition, some manufacturers and distributors enter
into comarketing agreements in which one manufacturer or its representatives undertake a contractual commitment
to provide specified services relating to drug marketing for one or more other manufacturers or distributors. FDA
does not regard the use of third parties or entry into comarketing agreements as absolving a manufacturer or distributor
from its responsibility for complying with the statute and regulations pertaining to the distribution of its drug
samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.36 would make clear that a manufacturer or authorized distributor of record that
uses a fulfillment house, shipping or mailing service, or other third party to fulfill some of the requirements of
PDMA, or engages in a comarketing agreement with another manufacturer, remains responsible for creating and maintaining
all requests, receipts, forms, reports, and records required under PDMA, PDA, and proposed part 203.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency will give a manufacturer or distributor that contracts with a third party to maintain some or all of its records
up to 48 hours to produce requested forms, reports, records, or other required documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Investigation and Notification Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In proposed &sect;203.37, FDA proposes to codify the requirements and procedures for undertaking investigations
and making reports and notifications to the agency regarding sample distribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Drug sample diversion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. To ensure against drug sample diversion, proposed &sect;203.37(a) would impose an investigation and reporting
requirement on a manufacturer or distributor who has reason to believe that any person has falsified drug sample requests,
receipts, or records. A full and complete investigation would have to be undertaken, and the manufacturer or distributor
would be required to report to FDA that such an investigation is under way and that it has completed such an investigation.
The proposal would require the report to include the reason for the investigation and the results of the investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because persons who falsify drug sample requests may be prosecuted under Title 18 of the United States Code, and because
falsifications are often associated with drug diversion, FDA is proposing to require manufacturers and distributors
to report such offenses to the agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the proposal would require that a manufacturer or distributor notify the agency of any falsification
of drug sample requests, receipts, or records, no later than 5 working days of learning of the falsification. The proposal
would permit an initial notification to be made by telephone or in writing, with a complete written report required
not later than 30 days after the date of the initial telephone or written notification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significant loss and known theft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. PDMA requires a manufacturer or distributor that distributes drug samples to notify FDA of any significant loss
of drug samples and any known theft of drug samples (21 U.S.C. 353(d)(3)(D)). FDA believes that enforcement would
be facilitated if the manufacturer or distributor promptly notifies the agency upon becoming aware of a significant
loss or theft. Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.37(b) would require a manufacturer or distributor to notify FDA
within 5 working days of becoming aware of such a loss or theft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;203.39 that charitable organizations be permitted to solicit and receive surplus drug
samples from licensed practitioners. As part of this program, FDA proposes to require that a charitable institution
that receives donated drug samples from a licensed practitioner also be required to notify FDA within 5 working days
of becoming aware of a loss or theft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reporting of any significant loss of drug samples is critical to the success of diversion control. Although a sample
can inadvertently become adulterated through mishandling, spoilage, or exposure to the elements, and although
samples are reported as stolen or lost from time to time, some representatives reportedly have used false claims of
damage, theft, or loss to divert drug samples into illicit commercial channels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA intends this requirement to mean that the agency is to be advised of actual, physical losses, but not insignificant
accounting mistakes. The agency does not seek to receive reports concerning minor mathematical errors that are caught
and corrected in the normal course of business. These are not significant losses that would trigger the reporting
requirement. FDA seeks comment on how to distinguish between significant losses and minor accounting or inventory
errors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is mindful of the difficulty of establishing a threshold for significant loss and requests comment on this
issue and examples of situations that may and may not be appropriate reportable losses. FDA currently believes that
a small discrepancy in the total inventory of a multimillion dollar company may not be significant and thus may not
trigger the reporting requirement, but the loss of a hundred tablets of a particular drug by one sales representative
in one quarter might be significant. Similarly, a bookkeeping imbalance may not be a loss, as long as it represents
small inventory discrepancies that are likely to be accounted for in the normal course of audits or other methods of
inventory control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not proposing to establish any ``tolerance'' level for sample losses below which no report is required. Each
manufacturer or distributor is required to establish its own threshold for determining when inventory not accounted
for is significant. This threshold should be derived from the firm's past experience in sample distribution and inventory
and should be based on the level of accuracy of its internal audit and security system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some manufacturers or distributors might be able to set a historically validated statistical baseline for the minimal
amounts of shrinkage that might be caused by routine accounting errors, mistakes, or losses, and a statistical baseline
for the frequency of occurrences that might routinely happen with a particular representative or product. However,
any loss of drug samples exceeding the number or frequencies of the established baselines must be reported. In addition,
any loss possibly associated with falsification of drug sample inventory or distribution records, or connected
with diversion activity, suspicious circumstances, or theft must be investigated and reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When FDA becomes aware of a significant loss or theft of drug samples, it may conduct its own investigation in cooperation
with or independent of the manufacturer's or distributor's investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing that an initial notification of a significant loss or known theft be made by telephone or in writing,
with a complete written report required not later than 30 days after the date of the initial notification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conviction of a representative
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. PDMA requires a manufacturer or distributor to notify FDA of any conviction of its representatives for a violation
of section 503(c)(1) of the act or any State law involving the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug sample or the offer to
sell, purchase, or trade a drug sample (21 U.S.C. 353(d)(3)(E)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that enforcement would be facilitated if prompt notice of such a conviction is provided to the agency.
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.37(c)(1) would require a manufacturer or distributor to notify FDA within 5 working
days of becoming aware of the conviction of one or more of its representatives for such a violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate such reports, proposed &sect;203.37(c) would permit an initial notification of such a conviction
to be made by telephone or in writing, but would require a complete written report to be submitted no later than 30 days
after the date of the initial notification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection of individual responsible for drug sample information
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. PDMA requires a manufacturer or distributor who distributes drug samples to provide FDA with the name and telephone
number of the individual responsible for responding to a request for information respecting drug samples (21 U.S.C.
353(d)(3)(F)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that enforcement would be facilitated if that information is transmitted to the agency shortly after
a designation is made. Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.37(d) would require a manufacturer or distributor to notify
FDA in writing within 30 days of the selection of such an individual and would also require the manufacturer or distributor
to supply the individual's business address to expedite easy communication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whom to notify at FDA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The proposed rule would set forth the addresses to which notifications and reports are required to be made. Under
the proposal, reports and notifications are required to be made to the Division of Drug Quality Evaluation (HFD&hyph;330),
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, for human prescription drugs; or the Division of Inspections and Surveillance
(HFM&hyph;650), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, for human biological prescription drug products.

11. Sample Lot or Control Numbers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A drug sample is a drug product as defined in 21 CFR 320.1(b). In 21 CFR 201.10(i)(1)(iii) and 201.18 of the general labeling
regulations and 21 CFR 211.130(b) of the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations, the label of drug
products is required to bear an identifying lot or control number capable of yielding the complete manufacturing
history of the package. Persons subject to the CGMP regulations are required under 21 CFR 211.196 to maintain distribution
records containing lot or control numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maintenance of records of lot numbers on drug samples will help provide the kind of accountability and oversight of
prescription drug sample distribution that PDMA is intended to provide. A comment to the docket from the Department
of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General not only endorsed this view, but suggested that maintenance
of drug sample distribution records, including lot numbers, would be important for enforcement purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.38 would require the manufacturer or authorized distributor of record of drug
samples to include in the drug sample labeling, the label of the sample unit, and distribution records identifying
lot or control numbers that will permit the tracking of the distribution of each drug sample unit from the point of its
manufacture to the representative or, if delivered by mail or common carrier, to the licensed practitioner. (In addition,
as discussed earlier, proposed &sect;&sect;203.30 and 203.31 also require that drug sample request and receipt
forms include lot or control numbers.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Sample Labels
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has been advised that some manufacturers and distributors use ordinary stock packages as drug samples. The agency
believes that this practice makes it difficult to distinguish samples from ordinary stock and contributes to drug
diversion. FDA believes that it is essential that drug samples be clearly and easily recognizable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.38(c) would require that each sample unit bear a label that clearly denotes its
status as a drug sample. An appropriate designation would include (but not be limited to) the word ``sample'' and the
terms ``not for sale'' and ``professional courtesy package.'' The proposed section would also provide that drug
products that are labeled or imprinted as samples are deemed to be drug samples within the meaning of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An article that meets the statutory definition of a drug sample that fails to bear the label required in proposed &sect;203.38(c)
would still be a sample despite the absence of the required label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
13. Disposition of Drug Samples by Licensed Practitioners
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PDMA permits manufacturers and distributors to distribute drug samples to licensed practitioners and to hospital
or health care entity pharmacies at the request of a licensed practitioner, provided certain documents and records
are created and maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDMA restricts drug sample distribution to ``licensed practitioners'' and to hospital or health care entity pharmacies
at the request of a ``licensed practitioner.'' A number of comments asked FDA to define the term ``licensed practitioner.''
For purposes of proposed part 203, FDA would, in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;203.3(o), define the term ``licensed practitioner'' to mean any person licensed by State law to prescribe
drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Physicians and surgeons, including osteopathic physicians and surgeons, are licensed to prescribe drugs in every
State, as are dentists and dental surgeons. In most States, podiatrists and optometrists are licensed to prescribe
certain drugs. In some States, pharmacists, physicians' assistants, paramedics, emergency medical technicians,
certified nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, or other medical professionals or paraprofessionals
may be licensed to prescribe drugs, sometimes on their own authority and sometimes on the authority of supervising
physicians. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some States limit the authority to prescribe prescription drugs to specific protocols or formularies for certain
professionals or paraprofessionals. For those professionals and paraprofessionals, FDA follows the requirements
of those States and considers the authority to request and receive drug samples to be similarly limited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 503(d)(1) of the act provides that no person may distribute any drug sample unless the requirements set forth
in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of that section are followed. Paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) set forth detailed requirements
for manufacturers and authorized distributors of record to follow when they distribute drug samples by mail or common
carrier and by representatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the section-by-section analysis that the Senate and House of Representatives ordered to be published in the Congressional
Record when PDA was introduced and passed, Congress stated that it did not intend this prohibition to restrict the
provision of a drug sample to a patient by a licensed practitioner or by another person at the direction of a licensed
practitioner in certain circumstances. (Congressional Record, August 10, 1992, p. S 12061&hyph;2; August 12, 1992,
p. H 8107&hyph;8.) Consequently, in PDA, Congress amended section 503(d)(1) of the act to clarify the prohibition
by stating that providing or dispensing a drug sample in certain circumstances is not considered distribution within
the meaning of the statute. The clarification specifically excludes from the term ``distribute'' the provision
of a drug sample to a patient by: (1) A practitioner licensed to prescribe such drug, (2) a health care professional
acting at the direction and under the supervision of such a practitioner, and (3) the pharmacy of a hospital or of another
health care entity that received the drug sample in accordance with the act and regulations, and that is acting at the
direction of the health care practitioner who requested the drug sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A licensed practitioner who provides a drug sample other than as set forth in section 503(d)(1) of the act is engaging
in an act of distribution, and drug sample distributions may be undertaken only as permitted by PDMA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that PDMA and this proposed rule would permit a licensed practitioner to: (1) Dispense the drug sample
as set forth in section 503(d)(1) of the act; (2) donate the drug sample to a charitable institution as provided for
in proposed &sect;203.39; (3) return the drug sample to the manufacturer or distributor; or (4) destroy the drug sample.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that any person, including a licensed practitioner, is prohibited from carrying out certain distributions
of drug samples, including: (1) Selling, purchasing, or trading (or offering to sell, purchase, or trade) any drug
sample; (2) requesting a manufacturer or distributor to deliver any drug sample to a retail pharmacy; (3) delivering
any drug sample to a retail pharmacy to be dispensed by the pharmacist to a patient of the licensed practitioner or other
persons; (4) giving any drug sample to a retail pharmacy; or (5) donating any drug sample to any charitable institution,
except as provided in proposed &sect;203.39. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDA singles out dispensing of drug samples by health care professionals who act at the direction and under the supervision
of licensed practitioners, and hospital or health care entity pharmacies that receive drug samples in accordance
with the act and regulations and that act at the direction of the health care practitioners who request samples. Thus,
Congress clearly intended to distinguish these persons from retail pharmacists. The pharmacist in a retail pharmacy
is an autonomous professional who is licensed by the State and supervised by the State Board of Pharmacy and independently
dispenses drugs to patients in response to a prescription written by a separate licensed practitioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from delivering a drug sample to any retail pharmacy, and a retail pharmacy
is barred from receiving any drug sample from any person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has been advised that some licensed practitioners have requested that drug samples be delivered to retail pharmacies
in rural, isolated, or medically underserved areas for dispensing to the practitioner's patients. FDA views this
practice as being inconsistent with the accountability and oversight requirements imposed on sample distribution
by PDMA. The agency believes it makes enforcement of the sample distribution sections difficult, and is a potential
source of drug diversion. Accordingly, FDA advises that a practitioner should not request delivery of a drug sample
to a retail pharmacy and that a retail pharmacy should not accept a drug sample from a licensed practitioner or from
a manufacturer or distributor to be dispensed by the pharmacist to a practitioner's patients or to other persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To cut off a potential source of drug diversion and promote enforcement of PDMA, FDA advises licensed practitioners
that they should return adulterated or misbranded drug samples to the manufacturer or distributor, or destroy them.
Examples of drug samples that may be adulterated or misbranded include, but are not limited to: (1) Samples that have
gone beyond the labeled expiration date; (2) samples that are obviously discolored, soiled, spoiled, or otherwise
deteriorated; (3) samples with mutilated or damaged packaging; and (4) samples with labeling that is torn, adjusted,
or modified.

14. Donation of Drug Samples by Licensed Practitioners to Charitable Institutions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is aware of the practice whereby some licensed practitioners give significant quantities of drug samples to charitable
institutions, such as free clinics, charity nursing homes, and charitable health care entities. Donated drug samples
are then dispensed by staff of the charitable institutions to patients or given to domestic or overseas missions or
other charitable institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some charitable institutions actively solicit and collect donations of drug samples from licensed practitioners,
and it is not uncommon for charitable institutions to rely on donated drug samples as a significant source of prescription
drugs for patient care. In response to concerns about this practice, FDA established procedures for drug sample donations
in Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 7132.08, ``Collection and Charitable Distribution of Drugs,'' issued on October
1, 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA continues to be concerned about drug sample donations. The agency believes that ongoing donations of drug samples
by licensed practitioners to charitable institutions could be considered as being inconsistent with the objectives
of accountability and oversight of sample distribution that PDMA is designed to provide. The agency is concerned
that this practice could make enforcement of the sample distribution sections difficult and provide an avenue for
drug diversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the principal purposes of PDMA was to prevent drug diversion. The easiest way to ensure that prescription drug
samples will not be diverted by charitable institutions would be to prohibit such institutions from possessing them.
However, Congress did not choose to do so. Indeed, PDMA explicitly allows prescription drug samples to be delivered
by a manufacturer or distributor to the pharmacy of a hospital or health care entity at the written request of a licensed
practitioner. Such a hospital or health care entity may be operated for profit or as a charitable institution. PDMA
is silent, however, as to whether or not there are other legitimate means by which a charitable institution can acquire
prescription drug samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operations of not-for-profit hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions were closely scrutinized
by Congress before the passage of PDMA. Congress identified sales of drugs acquired at below-wholesale prices by
hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions as a source of unfair competition for prescription
drug wholesalers who are required to pay the average wholesale price, and suggested that such sales could be a source
of drug diversion. (See sec. 2(7), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress also identified the sale of prescription drug samples as a source of diversion (see sec. 2(6), PDMA), but
did not suggest that charitable institutions were peculiarly likely to engage in this abuse. Instead, Congress sought
to balance the need for restrictions that would prevent unfair competition and put an end to diversion of prescription
drug samples with the goals of providing prescription drugs to all who need them and permitting the distribution,
with appropriate restrictions, of prescription drug samples to patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress did not alter this balance when in PDA, it revised the PDMA sample distribution restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has preliminarily concluded that development of a system that would permit licensed practitioners to donate
excess quantities of prescription drug samples to charitable institutions for dispensing to patients or for further
distribution to domestic or overseas charitable institutions for dispensing to patients would be consistent with
PDMA, PDA, and the goal of providing adequate medical care to patients in need.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A system that would permit such donations with adequate restrictions would ensure wider opportunities for the provision
of medical care, including prescription drugs, to patients in need, and would, if appropriate controls were established
similar to those governing sample distribution, be consistent with the language and intent of the statute. Controls
would serve the objectives of accountability and oversight in the act and minimize the potential for drug diversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a system would also prevent the waste of significant quantities of valuable prescription drugs that have been
distributed as drug samples to licensed practitioners who have not used or dispensed them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that such a system should contain audit and security protection, similar to those required in the statute
for requesting drug samples from manufacturers or distributors and delivering them to licensed practitioners,
to provide accountability and oversight, and to protect the public against drug diversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In designing such a system, the agency has kept in mind that the day-to-day operations of licensed practitioners,
including the provision of prescription drugs to patients, are regulated primarily by the States. In addition, there
is nothing in the legislative history of PDMA or PDA that would suggest that Congress intended FDA to become more deeply
involved in the regulation of the activities of licensed practitioners, except to the extent necessary to ensure
that drug samples are not diverted and that they do not, as a result, become adulterated or misbranded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the agency is proposing to establish a system of drug sample donation controls in proposed &sect;203.39.
Proposed &sect;203.39 would set up a system that would permit a licensed practitioner to donate a drug sample to a charitable
institution for dispensing to a patient of that institution or for distribution to another properly enrolled charitable
institution for subsequent dispensing to patients, provided that the institution is properly enrolled and certain
requirements are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;203.39, a charitable institution that wishes to solicit or receive drug samples would be required
to: (1) Become properly enrolled by notifying the agency of its intention to solicit and receive drug sample donations
and obtaining a central file number; and (2) maintain records of drug samples received as donations and subsequently
dispensed or distributed to other charitable institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A recipient charitable institution must provide written certification of compliance with all regulations to a licensed
practitioner or charitable institution that provides a drug sample before receiving any drug sample donation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the charitable institution or organization (defined as one that has been granted tax exempt status
by the Department of the Treasury under the requirements of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954)
would be required to enroll with FDA. A charitable institution would be enrolled when it has notified the appropriate
FDA district office that it intends to solicit and receive drug samples, has made application to the district office
for a central file number, and has received the number. A charitable institution would also be required to be licensed
by the State, if required by State law, and otherwise conform to State law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b) would establish procedures that the charitable institution would be required to follow
for receiving, holding, dispensing, and distributing donated drug samples. These requirements closely parallel
the statutory and proposed regulatory requirements for request and delivery of drug samples by manufacturers and
distributors to licensed practitioners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;203.39(b)(1), a recipient charitable institution would be required to provide a written identification
document to any employee or agent authorized to act on behalf of the institution in soliciting or receiving donations
of prescription drug samples. The employee or agent identification document would be valid for a limited term, but
could be renewed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not proposing to delineate the form and content of the required identification document, but it should be sufficient
to readily identify the agent or employee of the charity and to establish that he or she has the authority to solicit
and receive drug sample donations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such an identification document would be acceptable to the agency, for example, if it: (1) Would be effective for a
fixed term, e.g., 1 year, and would bear an expiration date; (2) would include the name, address, and central file number
of the charitable institution; (3) would exhibit the name, signature, and photograph of the authorized employee
or agent; and (4) would display an affirmative statement that the employee or agent identified on the document is authorized
by the institution to solicit and receive donations of prescription drug samples on behalf of the institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(2) would require each recipient charitable institution to maintain a current listing
of all agents or employees authorized to solicit and receive drug samples on behalf of the institution. The listing
would also be required to include the name and telephone number of the authorized agent or employee in charge of prescription
drug sample solicitation, receipt, and redistribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One problem associated with drug sample diversion has been the practice of ``shucking'' drug samples (separating
drug sample dosage units from their sample packaging (usually blister packs, cards, or small boxes) and sample labeling)
and repackaging them (often in plastic bags or ``baggies,'' or in other nonstandard containers with other sample
dosage units from the same or different drug sample lots or production runs). This repackaging process may be accompanied
by physical tampering with the sample dosage units with sharp or abrasive instruments or with solvents to remove imprints
denoting their status as samples. Because this practice adulterates and misbrands the samples, proposed &sect;203.39(b)(3)
would require that a drug sample could be donated by a licensed practitioner or donating charitable institution and
could be received by a charitable institution only in its original, unopened packaging with its labeling intact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(4) would permit delivery of a donated drug sample to a recipient charitable institution
by mail or common carrier, collection by an authorized agent or employee of the recipient charitable institution,
or personal delivery by a licensed practitioner or an authorized agent or employee of the donating charitable institution.
It would direct that the donor place the donated drug samples in a sealed carton for delivery to or collection by the
recipient institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;203.39(b)(5), a donated drug sample could not be dispensed to a patient or be distributed to
another charitable institution until a licensed practitioner or registered pharmacist at the recipient charitable
institution has examined it to confirm that the drug sample delivered matches the donation record and that any adulterated
or misbranded drug sample is eliminated. The recipient would be required to reject any drug sample that: (1) Is out
of date; (2) has labeling that has become mutilated, obscured, or detached from the drug sample packaging; (3) shows
evidence of having been stored or shipped under conditions that might adversely affect its stability, integrity,
or effectiveness; (4) is for a drug product that has been recalled or is no longer marketed; or (5) is otherwise possibly
contaminated, deteriorated, or adulterated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(6) would require recipient charitable institutions to dispose of any drug sample found
to be unsuitable by destroying it or by returning it to the manufacturer and to maintain complete records of the disposition
of all drug samples destroyed or returned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(7) would require that, if a donated drug sample is collected by an authorized agent or employee
of the recipient charitable institution or is personally delivered by a licensed practitioner or an authorized agent
of a donating charitable institution, the employee or agent of the recipient institution is to prepare at the time
of collection or delivery a complete and accurate donation record for the samples. Both the donor and recipient would
be required to sign the donation record when it is created, and the donor and recipient would each retain a copy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a donated drug sample is transferred by mail or common carrier, the licensed practitioner or donating charitable
institution would be required to prepare a donation record that would be signed by the licensed practitioner or authorized
agent of the donating charitable institution (&sect;203.39(b)(8) and (b)(9)). The donation record would be shipped
with the drug sample. An authorized agent or employee of the recipient charitable institution would be required to
countersign it, keep a copy, and return a copy to the licensed practitioner or donating charitable institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(9) would require the donation record to include: (1) The name, address, and telephone
number of the licensed practitioner (or donating charitable institution), and the practitioner's professional
title and State license number or DEA identification number; (2) the manufacturer, brand name, quantity, and lot
or control number of the sample; (3) the date of the donation; (4) the signature of the licensed practitioner (or the
signature of the authorized agent of the donating charitable institution); and (5) the signature of the authorized
agent or employee of the recipient charitable institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would require charitable institutions to maintain complete and accurate records of donation, receipt,
inspection, inventory, dispensing, redistribution, destruction, and returns sufficient for complete accountability
and auditing of drug sample stocks (&sect;203.39(b)(10)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would also require each recipient charitable institution to conduct an inventory of drug sample stocks, at least
annually, utilizing independent inventory personnel, and to prepare a report reconciling the results of each inventory
with the most immediate prior inventory. Inventory discrepancies and reconciliation problems would be required
to be investigated by the charitable institution and reported to FDA (&sect;203.39(b)(11)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(12) would require that a recipient charitable institution provide written certification
to the licensed practitioner or donating charitable institution that it is in conformity with all the requirements
of proposed part 203 before receiving any drug sample donation. Such certification, which links the licensed practitioner
with the charitable institution, could be made part of the donation record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(13) would require a recipient charitable institution to store drug samples under conditions
that will maintain the samples' stability, integrity, and effectiveness, and ensure that the drug samples will be
free of contamination, deterioration, and adulteration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(c) would also specify that a charitable institution may donate drug samples to another recipient
charitable institution for dispensing to patients, provided that the recipient charitable institution meets the
appropriate requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the procedure for drug sample donations delineated in proposed &sect;203.39, there are alternative
means available for charities to receive donated prescription drug products from manufacturers and distributors.
These include: (1) Direct donations of prescription drug stock by manufacturers or distributors, with records of
distribution and receipt being maintained in accordance with State regulations; and (2) deliveries of drug samples
to charity hospital and health care entity pharmacies by manufacturers and distributors or their representatives
under the request of a licensed practitioner in accordance with the requirements set forth in proposed &sect;&sect;203.30
and 203.31.

15. Free Distributions That Are Not Samples
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are certain situations in which manufacturers and distributors may deliver prescription drugs at no charge
without such free distributions being samples. Accordingly, such distributions are not subject to the recordkeeping
requirements for samples. Nevertheless, FDA believes that States and manufacturers and distributors should establish
recordkeeping requirements and systems, where appropriate, to prevent diversion.

Distribution of drugs to indigent patients
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As noted above, a drug sample is defined at proposed &sect;203.3(i) as a unit of a prescription drug that: (1) Is not
intended to be sold; and (2) is intended to promote the sale of the drug. Drugs that are given free of charge to patients
in some circumstances may not necessarily be samples. For example, manufacturers of some expensive new drugs have
decided that, under certain circumstances, they will arrange for licensed practitioners to prescribe and dispense
these drugs at no charge or at reduced cost to indigent patients. In FDA's view, if the objective of this practice is
to ensure that patients in need of prescription drugs will have access to them, whatever their financial circumstances,
then it is not a promotional scheme, and such drugs are not samples under section 503(c)(1) of the act or proposed &sect;203.3(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Starter packs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Starter packs are also not drug samples. Starter packs are prescription drug products distributed without charge
by manufacturers or distributors to pharmacists with the intent that the pharmacists place the prescription drugs
in stock and sell them at retail. Starter packs may be distributed by manufacturers' or wholesale distributors' representatives
(detailers), by mail or common carrier, or by direct delivery from a manufacturer or distributor. Starter packs of
solid oral dosage forms can be offered in ordinary stock packages, in special packaging comprised of unit-of-use
or course-of-treatment sizes, or in special packaging smaller than standard stock packages whose sizes have no relationship
to treatment regimens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Starter packs are intended to ``prime the pump'' by making a product available at no cost to the pharmacist so the pharmacist
will fill prescriptions with the manufacturer's product. They permit the patient and pharmacist to become familiar
with the manufacturer's product. Starter packs are a widely used selling tool and thus are intended to promote the
sale of the drug. Representatives often will make a sales presentation before delivering them or at the same time they
are delivered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDMA's definition of drug sample sets up a two-element test that determines whether a particular item of prescription
drug is a drug sample. The two-element test requires that the drug: (1) Is not intended to be sold; and (2) is intended
to promote the sale of the drug. Starter packs meet the second element of the drug sample test because they are intended
to promote the sale of a particular drug. However, even though starter packs are delivered without charge to pharmacists,
they do not conform to the first element of the statutory drug sample definition because the manufacturer or distributor
intends that they be sold by the pharmacist. Accordingly, starter packs are not samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because starter packs are not samples, they are not subject to the sample restrictions in PDMA. Instead, they are subject
to regulation as prescription drugs under the act in like manner as stock shipments of prescription drugs. Because
starter packs are not drug samples, the request, receipt, and recordkeeping requirements in PDMA for samples do not
apply, and pharmacists are free to sell these products at retail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because starter packs provide opportunities for diversion similar to those presented by drug samples, manufacturers,
and distributors should establish and maintain accounting, audit, and security systems for starter packs to guard
against diversion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pharmacy colleges
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For many years, manufacturers have given pharmacy schools and colleges pharmaceutical products for teaching purposes.
These products are given to help the schools train pharmacy students in drug formulation, compounding, packaging,
and labeling, and to familiarize students with dosage forms. These products are not intended to be distributed or
dispensed, nor are they intended to promote the sale of the drug. Accordingly, the agency does not view prescription
drugs donated to colleges of pharmacy for educational purposes as drug samples.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Donations of drugs to charitable institutions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. There is nothing in PDMA or in the legislative history of PDMA that would suggest that PDMA is intended to discourage
direct donations by manufacturers or distributors of stock packages of prescription drug products to charitable
institutions. Because these donations provide patients with the prescription drugs they need without regard to
cost and are not intended to promote the sale of the drug, the distributions are not sample distributions within the
meaning of section 503(c)(1) of the act or proposed &sect;203.3(i).

16. ``Bid'' and ``Commercial'' Samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Manufacturers of drug products sometimes take delivery of bulk drug ingredients or precursor specimens for testing
and evaluation purposes. These specimens are scrutinized for compatibility with a manufacturer's production equipment
and to determine if they are suitable for use in formulating the drug products the manufacturer wishes to produce.
Sometimes, manufacturers take delivery of examples of unpackaged finished dosage forms to determine if they are
suitable for use with the manufacturer's packaging materials and equipment. These specimens, referred to as ``bid''
or ``commercial'' samples, are generally delivered in limited quantities for evaluation purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The act defines a drug sample as a unit of a drug subject to section 503(b) of the act (i.e., a prescription drug), which
is not intended to be sold and is intended to promote the sale of the drug (21 U.S.C. 353(c)(1)). Proposed &sect;203.3(i)
restates this definition. Because of the statutory language and the threat of diversion, persons who distribute
``bid'' or ``commercial'' samples should follow the requirements for sample distribution set forth in the act and
this proposed rule.

1. Identifying Statements (``Pedigrees'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503(e)(1) of the act imposed a new requirement on ``unauthorized'' or ``secondary'' wholesale prescription
drug distributors (wholesale drug distributors who are not authorized distributors of record) to provide to a wholesale
distributor purchaser, before the completion of a sale, a statement identifying each sale of the drug (often referred
to as a ``statement of origin'' or ``drug pedigree''). PDA expanded this requirement by specifying the information
to be included in the drug pedigree and mandating that it be provided to retail pharmacy buyers as well as wholesale
distributor purchasers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pedigree requirements for unauthorized distributors under PDMA, as later amended by PDA, have been a matter of
continuing interest and discussion. These requirements affect only unauthorized wholesale distributors (i.e.,
those who do not have an ongoing business relationship with a manufacturer to distribute that manufacturer's drugs)
and impose upon them more stringent requirements than are imposed on authorized distributors of record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before passage of PDA, section 503(e)(1) of the act required that each person engaged in the wholesale distribution
of drugs subject to section 503(b) of the act (prescription drugs) who is not an authorized distributor of record of
such drugs provide to each wholesale distributor of such drugs a statement identifying each sale of the drug, including
the date of the sale, before the sale to such wholesale distributor. Soon after the enactment of PDMA, the terms ``secondary''
and ``unauthorized'' distributors became common to describe persons who are not authorized distributors of record,
and the term ``drug pedigree'' became popular to describe the required statement of origin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to make it possible to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized distributors, section 503(e)(1)
of the act also required each manufacturer to maintain at its corporate offices a current list of its authorized distributors.
This requirement was not altered by PDA, which otherwise amplified the pedigree requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When Congress adopted section 503(e)(1) of the act, it was responding to information uncovered by the Oversight Subcommittee
of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The Committee found that most counterfeit, stolen, expired, or fraudulently
obtained drugs entering commercial channels had been handled by distributors who were not authorized to distribute
the manufacturer's product, rather than by the manufacturer's authorized distributors. Accordingly, Congress
imposed a more stringent reporting requirement on distributions by unauthorized distributors, requiring them
to inform their wholesale customers of all previous sales of the drug product. (H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, p. 17.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments to the agency after enactment of PDMA reflected concerns about application of the drug pedigree
requirement. One comment asked FDA to consider whether the drug pedigree must include the name and address of the seller,
or whether a general statement, such as ``this shipment of drugs came from an unnamed authorized distributor on _________
__, 199_,'' or a coded statement, such as ``this shipment of drugs came from unauthorized distributor [code] on _______
__, 199_,'' would comply with PDMA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency stated its position on the form and content of the drug pedigree requirement in PDMA in a section of the August
1, 1988, information and guidance letter to regulated industry and other interested parties. The August 1, 1988,
letter requested that any drug pedigree be in writing, that it bear the title ``Statement Identifying Prior Sales
of Prescription Drugs by Unauthorized Distributors Required by the Prescription Drug Marketing Act,'' and that
it include all necessary identifying information regarding all sales in the chain of distribution of the product,
starting with the manufacturer or authorized distributor of record. The agency believed that this was consistent
with the legislative history of PDMA, which indicated that Congress intended that the drug pedigree be a written certification
fully identifying the source and place from which the drugs were obtained. (H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, p. 17; S. Rept. 100&hyph;202,
p. 7.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the August 1, 1988, letter, the agency requested that the identifying statement include the following information:
(1) The business name and address of the source from which the drug was purchased; (2) the date of the sale; and (3) the
identity, strength, container size, number of containers, and lot number(s) of the drug. FDA also requested that
the drug pedigree accompany all products purchased from an unauthorized distributor, even when they are resold.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Late in 1988, the American Association of Pharmaceutical Distributors (AAPD), an organization of wholesale prescription
drug distributors who are not authorized distributors of record for some or all of the products they distribute, designed
a form for drug pedigrees that substituted codes for names and addresses. AAPD's system, which is now reportedly being
used by its members and certain nonmembers, is administered by an accountant employed by AAPD for that purpose. The
agency does not know if other code systems exist that are being used in place of the required names and addresses on drug
pedigrees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the months following passage of PDMA, some Senators and members of Congress wrote to support coded pedigrees or
pedigrees that did not disclose full names and addresses. However, others expressed their support for full disclosure
on drug pedigrees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even before passage of PDA, FDA considered that Congress had intended the PDMA drug pedigree requirement to require
that each party in a chain of distribution be given sufficient information to make an informed determination as to
the origin of drugs being purchased. In the agency's view, general statements of origin could not provide sufficient
information for purchasers, and coded statements that made information unintelligible to purchasers without the
intervention of a trade association or regulatory agency to decipher the code, would not provide purchasers with
the information that Congress intended that they receive. In FDA's opinion, the only meaningful way to identify the
``source and place'' from which drugs were obtained was to require that the identifying statement bear the business
name and address of each previous distributor and the date of each prior sale. Furthermore, the only meaningful way
to identify fully the drugs being described was to provide detailed particulars about the drugs being sold. FDA has
stated this position in a number of letters, speeches, and public comments since PDMA became law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PDA amendments to the PDMA significantly tightened the drug pedigree requirement and constitute Congress' latest
word on the issue. PDA amended section 503(e)(1) of the act to require that unauthorized distributors provide, before
a sale takes place, a drug pedigree to every wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy customer. The drug pedigree
is required to identify all prior sales, purchases, or trades of such drugs and to specify by name and address all parties
to the transactions. PDA also states that FDA may require additional information or a specific form for the drug pedigree.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As Congress stated in the section-by-section analysis that accompanied PDA when it was introduced and passed, the
stricter language in the PDA revision ``makes it clear'' that any wholesale distribution of a prescription drug by
an unauthorized distributor, including any sale to another unauthorized distributor, an authorized distributor
of record, or a retail pharmacy, must be preceded by a full and complete identifying statement. ``The identifying
statement,'' the analysis added, ``must in all cases include the dates of each transaction involving the drug and
the names and addresses of all parties to the transaction, and must contain any such other information as the Secretary
may require.'' (Congressional Record, page S 12061, August 10, 1992; page H 8107, August 12, 1992.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Passage of PDA thus gave added emphasis to Congress' intent, as stated in the legislative history of PDMA, to restore
accountability to the wholesale sector of the pharmaceutical market and to regulate the wholesale distribution
of prescription drug products. (H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, pp. 16&hyph;17; S. Rept. 100&hyph;202, p. 7.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.50(a) would restate the statutory requirement that, before the completion of any wholesale
distribution by an unauthorized wholesaler to another wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy, the seller is required
to provide to the purchaser a statement identifying each prior sale, purchase, or trade of such drug. It would require
that the drug pedigree include: (1) The proprietary and established name of the drug; (2) the dosage; (3) the container
size; (4) the number of containers; (5) the drug's lot or control number(s); (6) the business name and address of all
parties to each prior transaction involving the drug, starting with the manufacturer; and (7) the date of each previous
transaction involving the drug.

2. Additional Manufacturing Processes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A manufacturer applies at least one manufacturing process to a bulk drug substance or precursor product to produce
a finished dosage form or a precursor product that will be further manufactured into a finished dosage form. Each of
these processes produces a changed product. Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.50(b) specifies that a manufacturer
who subjects a drug to any additional manufacturing processes to produce a different drug is not required to provide
to a purchaser a statement identifying the previous sales of the component drug or drugs.

3. Authorized Distributor Lists
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;203.50(c) would require each manufacturer to maintain at the corporate offices a current written
list of all authorized distributors of record. The term ``authorized distributor of record'' is defined in proposed
&sect;203.3(b) to mean a distributor with whom a manufacturer has established an ongoing relationship to distribute
such manufacturer's products. Because an agreement by which a single shipment of drugs is distributed would not constitute
an ongoing relationship (see proposed &sect;203.3(r)) that shipment would not establish an ``authorized distributor
of record'' relationship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also require the manufacturer's list to specify whether each distributor listed is authorized
to distribute the manufacturer's full product line, or only particular, specified products. The proposal would
also require the manufacturer to update the list on a continuing basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the PDMA legislative history, Congress stated that manufacturers' lists of authorized distributors of record
should be freely available to the public. Accordingly, FDA is also proposing that each manufacturer make its list
of authorized distributors of record available on request to the public for inspection and copying.

4. Unknown Origins or ``Salvaged'' Drugs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments inquired about persons that purchase lost or abandoned drugs from transportation companies
for sale to licensed wholesale distributors. This procedure is sometimes referred to as drug salvage, although it
differs from the process identified as salvaging in 21 CFR part 211. These inquiries suggested that identifying statements
for ``salvaged'' drugs should list the transportation company from which the drugs were ``salvaged'' as the point
of origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that this kind of business operation cannot meet the requirements of the CGMP regulations, nor can it
operate in a manner consistent with PDMA's requirements (e.g., that a wholesale distributor give a wholesale distributor
purchaser a statement of origin for the product being sold).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's view is that the requirement for a statement of origin is designed to permit prospective purchasers to determine
if the source of a drug is a legitimate source, such as an authorized distributor or secondary distributor licensed
by the State as a wholesale distributor. The agency believes that an ``origin unknown'' statement or a statement that
a particular shipment of prescription drugs originated as ``salvage'' or that they came from a lost shipment from
unknown persons at an unknown time would not be consistent with the meaning of that provision. Thus, in FDA's view,
use of an ``origin unknown'' or ``salvage'' statement would not meet the requirement for an identifying statement
under section 503(e)(1) of the act.

5. State Licensing of Wholesale Distributors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PDMA established a requirement that any person engaged in the wholesale distribution in interstate commerce of prescription
drugs in a State be licensed by the State in accordance with guidelines issued as a final rule by the agency (21 U.S.C.
353(e)(2)). The final rule that set forth guidelines for State licensing of wholesale prescription drug distributors
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 14, 1990 (55 FR 38012), making the requirement that any person engaging in the wholesale distribution
of prescription drugs in interstate commerce shall be licensed by the State in which it operates, become effective
September 15, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Congress passed PDA, which modified the State licensing requirement, before the date on which the requirement
would have gone into effect. PDA amended section 503(e) of the act to establish a temporary Federal registration procedure
for wholesale prescription drug distributors in those States that do not have a licensing program that meets the Federal
guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This temporary Federal wholesale distributor registration procedure expires on September 14, 1994. After that
date, all persons engaged in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs in interstate commerce are required
to be licensed by the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA issued a letter to industry and other interested persons on September 3, 1992, that provides information and guidance
on the procedure to be followed by wholesale distributors required to register under the temporary Federal wholesale
distributor registration procedure established by PDA. (See the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

6. Defining ``Wholesale Distribution''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``wholesale distribution'' is defined in section 503(e)(4)(B) of the act as distribution of prescription
drugs to other than the consumer or patient, but not including intracompany sales or distributions of drugs described
in section 503(c)(3)(B) of the act. The exclusions under section 503(c)(3)(B) of the act are for the purchase or other
acquisition by a hospital or other health care entity member of a group purchasing organization of a drug for its own
use from the organization or from other hospitals or health care entity members of the organization; the sale, purchase,
or trade of a drug or an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug by a charitable organization to a nonprofit affiliate
of the organization to the extent otherwise permitted by law; the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug or an offer to sell,
purchase, or trade a drug among hospitals or other health care entities under common control; the sale, purchase,
or trade of a drug or an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug for emergency medical reasons; and the sale, purchase,
or trade of a drug, an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug, or the dispensing of a drug pursuant to a prescription
executed in accordance with section 503(b) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These exclusions are part of the proposed definition of ``wholesale distribution'' in proposed &sect;203.3(y).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For clarity, FDA proposes to codify additional exclusions in proposed &sect;203.3(y) that have already been discussed
in this notice. They are the distribution of drug samples by manufacturers' and authorized distributors' representatives;
the sale, purchase, or trade of blood and blood components intended for transfusion; drug reshipments, when conducted
in accordance with proposed &sect;203.23; and drug returns, when conducted in accordance with proposed &sect;203.24.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, as discussed below, FDA is proposing to codify an exclusion from the definition of wholesale distribution
for the sale of minimal quantities of drugs by retail pharmacies to licensed practitioners for office use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For consistency, FDA is also proposing to incorporate these additional exclusions in the definition of ``wholesale
distribution'' at &sect;205.3(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Sales to Licensed Practitioners by Retail Pharmacies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, a retail pharmacy that engages in the business of selling prescription drugs to licensed practitioners
is a wholesale distributor that, since September 15, 1992, has been required to be licensed by the State as a wholesaler
or registered with FDA if the State does not have a conforming licensing program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensed practitioners often purchase small quantities of drugs from retail pharmacies for office use. Many wholesale
distributors are reluctant to open accounts with individual practitioners for small quantities of drugs, and some
practitioners believe that there is no cost-effective, reasonable alternative for making occasional purchases
of small quantities of drugs for office use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history supports the view that Congress did not intend to interfere with this small-scale practice.
According to the House Report, ``It is the express intent of the Committee that the scope of section 6 include distribution
by * * * all sellers of prescription drugs in wholesale quantities to persons or firms other than the consumer or patient.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, p. 17.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that permitting the sale of small quantities of prescription drugs by retail pharmacies to licensed
practitioners for office use without the requirement of a State wholesale distributor's license satisfies a legitimate
need and is consistent with the intent of the statute. Accordingly, the agency has included language in proposed &sect;203.3(y)
that would exclude the sale of minimal quantities of drugs by retail pharmacies to licensed practitioners for office
use from the definition of ``wholesale distribution.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this context, sales of prescription drugs by a retail pharmacy to licensed practitioners for office use will be
considered to be minimal if the total annual dollar volume of prescription drugs sold to licensed practitioners does
not exceed 5 percent of the dollar volume of that retail pharmacy's annual prescription drug sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a retail pharmacy is engaged in wholesale sales of prescription drugs in any amount after September 15, 1992, the
presumption will be that the retail pharmacy is, in fact, a wholesale distributor that must be licensed by the State
in accordance with part 205, or registered with FDA if the State does not have a conforming licensing program, unless
it can be shown that the total annual dollar volume of its sales to licensed practitioners does not exceed 5 percent
of the dollar volume of that pharmacy's annual prescription drug sales and the pharmacy does not otherwise engage
in wholesale distribution.

8. Sales to Wholesale Distributors by Retail Pharmacies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA received a number of questions asking whether PDMA prohibits a retail pharmacy from selling prescription drugs
to a wholesale distributor. FDA advises that there is no provision in PDMA, the final PDMA State licensing guidelines,
or this proposed rule that would prohibit a retail pharmacy from selling prescription drugs to a wholesale distributor.
However, a retail pharmacy that engages in such sales would become a wholesale distributor that would be required
to provide the wholesale distributor purchaser with an identifying statement for the drugs sold and would be required
to have a valid State wholesale distributor license or be registered with FDA if the State does not have a conforming
licensing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Request and Receipt Forms, Reports, and Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;203.60 sets forth standards for request and receipt forms, reports, and for the creation, retention,
and maintenance of records and other documents under proposed part 203. These requirements, although procedural
in nature, are essential for the efficient administration and enforcement of PDMA and proposed part 203.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Recordkeeping Media
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing that manufacturers and distributors have the option of creating or maintaining records on nonpaper
media. FDA believes that recent technological advances compel the agency to reexamine how the requirements for written
records (including forms bearing written signatures) can be satisfied by electronic media. FDA believes that greater
efficiency, lower costs, and more effective enforcement can result from an effort to facilitate the development
and use of photographic, electronic, and other nonpaper devices, and media for creation and maintenance of sample
requests, receipts, records, and other forms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.60(a) would permit request and receipt forms, reports, records, and other documents
required by PDMA, PDA, and this proposed rule to be created on paper or on electronic media.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.60(b) would permit request and receipt forms, reports, records, and other documents required
by PDMA, PDA, and this proposal that are created on paper to be maintained on paper or by photographic or electronic
recordation or imaging, provided that appropriate security and authentication requirements are followed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.60(c) would permit request and receipt forms, reports, records, and other documents required
by PDMA, PDA, and this proposal that are created by means of electronic data entry and recordkeeping equipment to be
stored using computer technologies, provided that appropriate security and authentication requirements are followed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, appropriate photographic records and electrographic records could include, but not be limited
to, those maintained on microfilm, microcard, microfiche, and xerographic copies. Appropriate electronic records
could include, but not be limited to, those maintained in analog or digital form or by means of image recording technology
on computer disks, cards, tapes, memory chips, or optical media. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Security and Authentication Requirements for Request and Receipt Forms, Reports, Records, and Other Documents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would require that any request or receipt form, report, record, or other document, and any signature
appearing thereon, is to be created, maintained, or transmitted in a form that provides reasonable assurance of being:
(1) Resistant to tampering, revision, modification, or alteration; (2) preserved in accessible and retrievable
fashion; and (3) visible or readily made visible to permit copying or other means of duplication for purposes of review,
analysis, verification, authentication, and reproduction by the person who executed the form or created the record,
by the manufacturer or distributor, and by authorized personnel of FDA or other regulatory and law enforcement agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Retention of Request and Receipt Forms, Reports, Lists, Records, and Other Documents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule also sets standards for the retention of request and receipt forms, reports, lists, records, and
other documents. PDMA requires the retention of certain records for not less than 3 years. FDA believes that, with
one exception, the 3-year minimum requirement should be extended to all records created and maintained under the
statute and the proposed rule to ensure efficient enforcement and compliance operations. Accordingly, the proposal
would state that any person required to create or maintain forms, reports, lists, or other records under the statute
or regulations would have to retain them for at least 3 years after the date of their creation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that a more stringent standard is necessary for the retention of records relating to drug sample
distribution because some drug samples are relatively stable and may remain unexpired even though 3 or more years
may have elapsed since they were packaged and shipped. Accordingly, the proposal would require that forms, reports,
or records relating to the distribution of drug samples be retained for at least 3 years after the date of the record's
creation or the date of expiration of a drug sample for which the record is being kept, whichever is later.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Availability of Forms, Reports, Lists, and Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forms, reports, lists, or other records are of little value to FDA or other regulatory and law enforcement agencies,
unless they are readily available for inspection and copying. Accordingly, the proposal would compel any person
required to create or maintain forms, reports, lists, or other records under PDMA, PDA, or the proposed rule to make
them available upon request, in a form that permits copying or other means of duplication, to FDA or other Federal,
State, or local regulatory and law enforcement officials for review and reproduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Signatures on Forms, Reports, or Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By affixing a signature to a document, the person who signs it is giving his or her personal verification of the validity
of a document. For example, by affixing a signature to a drug sample request form, the person signing it attests to the
fact that he or she is a licensed practitioner and that he or she has requested delivery of a specific amount and type
of drug sample. Similarly, a signature on a receipt verifies the delivery of the drug samples to the licensed practitioner
or to the pharmacy of a hospital or other health care entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has preliminarily concluded that a valid signature need not be made by pen or indelible pencil on a piece of paper.
Instead, the agency believes that in certain circumstances a valid signature can be created and recorded by electronic
means.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, under proposed &sect;203.61 a verifiable signature may be made by use of a writing or marking instrument
such as a pen, indelible pencil, or electronic stylus on electronic pad. Because some imprinting or copying devices
can be used to forge or falsely imprint a signature, and because false signatures and forgeries could be an integral
part of a drug diversion scheme, the proposal would prohibit imprinting or automatic reproduction of a signature
by a device or machine such as a stamp, copier, or autopen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.61 would establish performance standards and special security requirements for signatures
signed on electronic media. Proposed &sect;203.61(b) would require that if electronic media are used to execute
and record signatures, it must be installed and operated with: (1) A system permitting visual review of the signature;
(2) a system to detect or inhibit entry of a forged, traced, fraudulent, or counterfeit signature, i.e., authentication
software; and (3) a mechanism that blocks alteration of documents or signatures after the signatures are made, i.e.,
a locking device.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons interested in commenting on electronic records and electronic signatures should be aware that an agency
task force, the FDA Electronic Identification/Signature Working Group, is currently assessing issues relating
to electronic signatures and recordkeeping. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 21, 1992 (57 FR 32185), FDA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) entitled ``Electronic
Identification/Signatures; Electronic Records; Request for Information and Comments.'' The notice stated that
the agency is considering whether it should propose regulations that would, under certain circumstances, accept
electronic signatures in place of handwritten signatures where signatures are currently required in Title 21 of
the Code of Federal Regulations and is asking for comments on any related issues. Comments were to be identified with
Docket No. 92N&hyph;0251. The working group has reviewed the comments in the docket and the agency is considering
additional action. The agency's emerging position on electronic signatures and records will be coordinated with
the final PDMA policies requirements and administrative procedures rule. Suggestions on electronic signatures
and other signature substitutes and surrogates made to FDA in response to this proposed rule will also be made available
to the working group force for its review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Criminal Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most violations of the act are punishable as misdemeanors, except that a violation committed after a prior conviction,
or a violation committed with the intent to defraud or mislead, is punishable as a felony. In addition, FDA advises
that persons who knowingly make any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations, or knowingly
make or use any false writing or document, in any matter within the jurisdiction of a Federal department or agency;
who engage in mail fraud or wire fraud; or who otherwise obstruct agency regulatory activities may be subject to prosecution
under Title 18 of the United States Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most PDMA violations are felonies punishable by a prison term of not more than 10 years, a fine of not more than $250,000,
or both. Felonies under PDMA include the knowing importation of a drug in violation of section 801(d)(1) of the act;
the knowing sale, purchase, or trade of a drug or drug sample, or the knowing offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug
or drug sample in violation of section 503(c)(1) of the act; the knowing sale, purchase, or trade of a drug coupon; the
knowing offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug coupon, or the knowing counterfeiting of such a coupon in violation
of section 503(c)(2) of the act; or the knowing distribution of drugs in violation of section 503(e)(2)(A) of the act.
Misdemeanors include the distribution of a drug sample in violation of section 503(d) of the act and the failure to
comply with the ``pedigree'' requirement of section 503(e)(1)(A) of the act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Civil Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PDMA also includes provisions for civil penalties for certain violations of the drug sample distribution requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturer or distributor who distributes drug samples by means other than mail or common carrier, whose representative,
in the course of his or her employment, violates the PDMA prohibition against the sale, purchase, or trade or offer
to sell, purchase, or trade drug samples, or any State law prohibiting the sale, purchase, or trade or offer to sell,
purchase, or trade drug samples, is, upon conviction of the representative, subject to civil penalties as follows:
(1) A civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each of the first two such violations resulting in a conviction of any
representative of the manufacturer or distributor in any 10-year period; and (2) a civil penalty of not more than $1,000,000
for each violation resulting in a conviction of any representative after the second conviction in any 10-year period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturer or distributor who fails to report to FDA any conviction of one of its representatives for violations
of section 503(c)(1) of the act or any State law that prohibits the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug sample (or the offer
to sell, purchase, or trade a drug sample) is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $100,000.

3. Rewards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7 of PDMA (section 303(b)(5) of the act) provides that a person who provides information leading to the institution
of a criminal proceeding against, and conviction of, a person for the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug sample, or the
offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug sample in violation of section 503(c)(1) of the act, is entitled to one-half
of the criminal fine imposed and collected for such violation, but not more than $125,000. The proposed rule provides
in &sect;203.70 that an application for such a reward be made to the Director, Office of Compliance, of the appropriate
Center.

H. Technical Amendment to State Licensing Guideline
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing a technical amendment to the storage and handling requirements of the State licensing guideline
at &sect;205.50(c) to clarify the agency's intention that the paragraph require that prescription drugs be stored
at appropriate temperatures in accordance with the requirements of the 22d edition of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia (U.S.P.
XXII), the current edition of that compendium.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Analysis of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the principles set out in the Executive Order.
In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the requirements in this proposed rule have already been implemented by the regulated industry in response
to PDMA's enactment, FDA's guidance, and industry trade associations' recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory costs of this proposal, which are due to increased paperwork requirements, were calculated by multiplying
an estimate of the time necessary to complete the paperwork for each section by an hourly wage rate of $44.99. The agency
estimates that nonprofit health care organizations (hospitals and charitable organizations) will require roughly
76,100 hours to complete the paperwork, at a cost of just over $3.4 million (76,000 hours X $44.99) annually. Pharmaceutical
manufacturers and distributors will need about 476,000 hours to comply with the paperwork requirements, at a cost
of around $21.4 million (476,000 hours X $44.99) annually. In total, therefore, the industry will utilize 552,000
hours (76,000 + 476,000) and spend approximately $24.8 million (3.4 million + 21.4 million) to complete the paperwork
requirements. Further details for these estimates are included with the agency's paperwork reduction package,
prepared pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Most of the requirements in this proposed rule have already been implemented by
the regulated industry, including small entities, in response to PDMA's enactment, FDA's guidance, and industry
trade association recommendations. Consequently, the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no
further analysis is required.

IV. Executive Order 12612: Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 requires Federal agencies to examine carefully regulatory actions to determine if they would
have a significant impact on federalism. Using the criteria and principles set forth in the Order, the agency has considered
the impact of this proposed rule on the States, on their relationship with the Federal government, and on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is publishing this proposed rule to set forth agency policies and requirements and provide administrative procedures,
information, and guidance for those sections of PDMA that are not related to State licensing of wholesale drug distributors.
Because enforcement of these sections of PDMA is a Federal responsibility, there should be little, if any, impact
on the States from this rule, if it is finalized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA certifies that it has examined this proposed rule. Because it has little, if any, effect on federalism issues,
as stated above, and because any effects are not significant, this proposed rule does not require an assessment under
Executive Order 12612.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 8, 1990, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub L. 101&hyph;535) (the 1990 amendments)
was enacted. This new law amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) in a number of important ways. One
of the most notable aspects of the 1990 amendments is that they added section 403(q) to the act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)). This
section provides that, with certain exceptions, a food_that is, both a food in conventional form and a dietary supplement
of vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances_is misbranded unless its label or labeling
bears certain nutrition information (nutrition labeling). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 amendments, however, also provide an exemption from mandatory nutrition labeling for small businesses.
Section 403(q)(5)(D) of the act provides that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[I]f a person offers food for sale and has annual gross sales made or business done in sales to consumers which is not
more than $500,000 or has annual gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers which is not more than
$50,000, the requirements of subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) [the provisions that establish the nutrition labeling
requirement] shall not apply with respect to food sold by such person to consumers unless the label or labeling of food
offered by such person provides nutrition information or makes a nutrition claim.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 at 60376), in a document entitled ``Food Labeling; Reference Daily Intakes and Daily
Reference Values; Mandatory Status of Nutrition Labeling and Nutrient Content Revision'' (hereinafter referred
to as ``the mandatory nutrition labeling proposal''), FDA proposed to reflect this provision of the 1990 amendments
in &sect;101.9(j)(1) of its regulations (21 CFR 101.9(j)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many comments to the mandatory nutrition labeling proposal stressed that the dollar exemption limits that FDA proposed
to implement in the 1990 amendments were too low. The comments argued that the sum of the analytical, printing, and
other costs of nutrition labeling are prohibitively expensive for low-volume products. FDA found that these comments
were persuasive, and that some adjustment to this exemption was necessary. Additionally, FDA participated in a series
of public forums that had been scheduled by the United States Department of Agriculture to discuss the small business
issue. These forums were held in May 1992 in Kansas City, MO; Atlanta, GA; and San Francisco, CA. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 6, 1992 (57 FR 19410), FDA announced its participation in the public forums and requested comment on a number
of issues concerning exemption of food products of small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency compiled the information that it received in response to the notice and at the public forums. This information
helped form the basis for the agency's ``Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis of the Regulations Implementing
the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990'' (Ref. 1). FDA announced the public availability of this analysis
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36205). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In adopting the exemption for food labeled by small businesses in its final rule on nutrition labeling of January 6,
1993, entitled ``Food Labeling: Mandatory Status of Nutrition Labeling and Nutrient Content Revision, Format for
Nutrition Label'' (58 FR 2079 at 2144) (hereinafter referred to as ``the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule''),
FDA stated that it was constrained by the requirements of section 403(q)(5)(D) of the act. Therefore, the agency adopted
the exemption for small business, as it had proposed the exemption, as part of the mandatory nutrition labeling final
rule in &sect;101.9(j)(1)(i). This exemption (as corrected on August 18, 1993 (58 FR 44063 at 44083)) states:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency established the same exemption in &sect;101.36(f)(1) (21 CFR 101.36(f)(1)) for dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals in a final rule entitled ``Food Labeling; General Requirements for Nutrition Labeling for
Dietary Supplements of Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, or Other Similar Nutritional Substances'' that it published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 354) (hereinafter referred to as ``the dietary supplement final rule''). Under that final
rule, &sect;101.9(j)(1) applies to dietary supplements of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances manufactured,
packed, or distributed by small firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At about the same time that FDA published the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule, a number of small businesses
and the trade associations that represent them made a concerted effort to bring their concerns about the exemption
from nutrition labeling for food products of small businesses and about their problems in meeting the requirements
of the new law to the attention of Congress. In response to these concerns, a bill was introduced and passed to provide
relief to small businesses. In presenting this bill for consideration in Congress, Congressman Dingell noted that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the last two years, it has become evident that, unfortunately, the NLEA exemption for small businesses was too
limited. It became clear that many small food businesses simply could not comply with the law's requirements in the
timeframe allowed. Some very small businesses may have great difficulty complying at all. Concerns about this matter
have been raised to FDA's attention and ours. They are legitimate concerns and they should be addressed. The bill we
are introducing today addresses companies with small numbers of employees and products sold in relatively small
quantities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 -->
* * * * *
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments will provide greatly needed help to small businesses for whom a more realistic deadline for NLEA
compliance is essential. Small specialty food manufacturers and retail confectioners, many of whom rely on low-volume
sales of seasonal products, will be able to spread the cost of product analysis and printing over a 2- or 3-year period.
This literally will allow them to stay in business. According to the Retail Confectioners Association, for example,
a 1-year delay in NLEA implementation saves hundreds of millions of dollars.

(139 Congressional Record E 2016 (August 5, 1993).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 13, 1993, the President signed the 1993 amendments into law (Pub. L. 103&hyph;80). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1993 amendments establish a new exemption for low-volume food products that will be available to manufacturers,
packers, and distributors based on the number of people that they employ. In creating this new exemption, Congress
was responding to the information presented to it that: (1) It can cost several thousand dollars to change the label
of a food product to bring it into compliance with the requirements for nutrition labeling; (2) many small businesses
simply cannot comply with the requirements within the time frames allowed; and (3) the cost of complying with the nutrition
labeling requirements will be prohibitive for small businesses with a low volume of products at low profits (Refs.
2 through 4). By providing additional time before low-volume food products of small businesses must conform with
the requirements for nutrition labeling, the 1993 amendments will permit small firms to use up stocks of labels, thereby
reducing the costs of label inventory disposal, and to avoid having to compete for design and printing resources with
larger firms. By providing that food produced by firms having fewer than 100 employees and selling fewer than 100,000
units of a food product will not have to be nutrition labeled (at least until 2002), the 1993 amendments save such firms
the expense of nutrient analysis and preparation of new labels for those products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the new provisions, persons that claim an exemption for a low-volume food product must file with FDA an annual
notice claiming the exemption, with the first such notice due by May 7, 1994 (section 403 (q)(5)(E)(iii) of the act),
that is, before the first 12-month period during which the nutrition labeling regulations will be in effect. Although
the filing of the notice is necessary for an exemption, the agency notes that, under section 403 (q)(5)(E)(i)(I) and
(q)(5)(E)(ii) of the act, a product would not be exempt if its labeling provides nutrition information or bears a nutrient
content or health claim.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement that the labeling of a product not include nutrition information creates an anomalous result. FDA
is aware that a number of small businesses market low-volume food products whose labeling bears nutrition information
in accord with the pre-1990 amendment nutrition labeling requirements of the agency's regulations. Because such
products bear nutrition information, they would not be eligible for the exemption in section 403(q)(5)(E). Such
a result makes little sense under the 1993 amendments, however; small firms with low-volume products, to which Congress
was attempting to provide some relief, would be penalized for having provided nutrition information, exactly what
Congress was trying to encourage, in the past. Such firms would be presented with the choice of either removing the
nutrition information from the labeling of eligible products, which would impose costs that Congress was trying
to protect these firms from having to expend, or marketing misbranded products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is considering providing relief in such cases under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;101.9(g)(9). Under this section of its regulations, FDA may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with a situation when it is not technologically
feasible, or some other circumstance that makes it impracticable, for firms to comply with the requirements for nutritional
labeling in &sect;101.9(c). FDA is currently limiting the permission that it grants for alternative means of compliance
or additional exemptions in response to requests under &sect;101.9(g)(9) to those cases that involve technological
problems. However, based upon the comments that it receives in response to this proposal, FDA will consider whether
the cost to a small business of changing the labeling of a low-volume food product in response to the 1993 amendments
represents a circumstance that makes it impracticable for the firm to comply with the requirements of &sect;101.9(c)
and for which FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or provide an exemption. FDA will consider modifying
&sect;101.9(g)(9) in such a manner as it finds appropriate based on consideration of comments, to accommodate this
situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the regulations implementing the 1993 amendments are in place as close as possible to May 8, 1994, the
date of applicability for the nutrition labeling regulations, FDA is proposing that any final rule that may issue
in response to this proposal become effective upon its publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The agency believes that it is in the public interest to have a final rule in place as quickly as possible so that people
will know exactly what they must do to claim the exemption and to minimize the possibility that eligible firms will
fail to file their claims for exemption in a timely manner. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that there is good
cause to dispense with the normal 30-day period between publication of a final rule and its effective date. Given the
small amount of time before May 8, 1994, however, FDA recommends that persons that want to file notices with FDA to claim
the small business exemption follow the procedures proposed below.

II. The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Application of Existing Small Business Exemption From Nutrition Labeling Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In establishing the regulations that provide exemptions for foods labeled by small businesses, i.e., &sect;101.9(j)(1)
for foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances
and &sect;101.36(f)(1) for dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals, FDA interpreted the 1990 amendments as
applying to food offered for sale by manufacturers, packers, and distributors. However, the Statement of Explanation
for H.R. 2900 (the bill that became the 1993 amendments) states that this interpretation was an inappropriate extension
of the law: ``[T]he statutory language provides that this exemption applies only to retailers (`person[s who] offer[]
food *&blank;*&blank;* to consumers').'' (139 Congressional Record H6358 (August 6, 1993).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing that manufacturers, packers, and distributors may have reasonably relied on the small business exemption
provided in &sect;101.9(j)(1), Congress, in section 2(a)(1) of the 1993 amendments, provided that the exemption
in section 403(q)(5)(D) of the act will continue to be available until May 7, 1995, in accordance with the regulation,
that is, based on gross sales made or business done to the consumer by manufacturers, packers, and distributors that
do not sell directly to the consumer. Section 2(a)(2) of the 1993 amendments further provides that after May 8, 1995,
this exemption will only be available with respect to food offered for sale by a person who makes direct sales to consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to modify &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(1) and 101.36(f), consistent with the provisions of section 2(a)
of the 1993 amendments, to establish May 7, 1995, as the date after which the exemption provided in section 403(q)(5)(D)
of the act will not be available to food labeled by manufacturers, packers, and distributors but will only be available
to food offered for sale by a person who makes direct sales to consumers. The agency is revising the numbering of &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(1)
and 101.36(f) to accommodate the proposed modifications.

B. New Small Business Exemption From Nutrition Labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1993 amendments added new section 403(q)(5)(E) to the act. This section provides an exemption for low-volume
food products of small businesses from the mandatory nutrition labeling requirements of section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2)
of the act. FDA is proposing to amend &sect;101.9(j) by adding a new paragraph (j)(18) to reflect this exemption. Under
proposed &sect;101.9(j)(18), qualification for the exemption for a low-volume food product is based on four factors:
(1) The number of units of that food product sold in the United States; (2) the average number of full-time equivalent
employees of the person claiming the exemption, e.g., the firm or corporation; (3) the absence of other nutrition
information or nutrition claims in the labeling for that food product; and (4) the timely filing with FDA of a notice
claiming the exemption. FDA is also proposing similar revisions to &sect;101.36(f) to provide this exemption from
the requirements of section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2) of the act for low-volume food products that are dietary supplements
of vitamins or minerals.

1. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of this regulation, FDA is proposing in &sect;101.9(j)(18)(vi)(A), (j)(18)(vi)(B), and (j)(18)(vi)(C)
(and also &sect;101.36 (f)(2)(vi)(A), (f)(2)(vi)(B), and (f)(2)(vi)(C)) to adopt, with minor changes, the definitions
for ``unit,'' ``food product,'' and ``person'' respectively, as established by the 1993 amendments in section 403(q)(5)(E)(vi)
of the act. Also, the agency is proposing a definition for the term ``average number of full-time equivalent employees''
in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(vi)(D) and 101.36(f)(2)(vi)(D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unit.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The agency is proposing to define in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(vi)(A) and 101.36(f)(2)(iv)(A) the term ``unit''
to mean ``the packaging or, if there is no packaging, the form in which a food product is offered for sale to the consumer.''
This definition reflects section 403(q)(5)(E)(vi)(I) of the act. Consistent with this definition, any completely
labeled package such as a can, bottle, box, or bag of a food product that is presented for sale to the consumer is a unit
of that product. Thus, for example, for soft drinks, a 12-pack or a 24-pack of 12-ounce (oz) cans that are fully labeled
would represent 12 or 24 units, respectively, of that soft drink because each can is in a form in which it can be offered
for sale to the consumer. On the other hand, in the case of a package containing six 4-oz containers of pudding, the individual
containers of which are not completely labeled (i.e., it complies with the provisions of &sect;101.9(j)(15)), the
package of six would constitute one unit. The difference between these two examples is that in the second case, the
packaging of the product, as it is presented to the consumer, is as an individual unit of six containers (a multiunit
retail food package), whereas in the first instance, the 12-pack or 24-pack is a convenience used by the manufacturer
to deliver 12 or 24 individual units of the product to the consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that there also may be occasions where a food product is sold in bulk or in individual pieces rather
than in packaging; e.g., flour may be sold from bulk containers in a grocery store. Such products are not exempt from
nutrition labeling but must have the nutrition information provided on the bulk container from which the food is dispensed
(&sect;&sect;101.9(j)(16) and 101.36(g)). Under the proposed definition for ``unit,'' a person will have to determine
the number of units of product sold in the United States not in packaging on the basis of the typical sales practice for
the food product. For example, if 2,000 pounds of flour are sold from bulk displays at grocery stores, and the typical
practice for sales to consumers is to price the flour on a per pound basis, then the bulk sales would represent 2,000
units.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be eligible for an exemption from the provisions of &sect;&sect;101.9 or 101.36, as discussed in more detail below,
the total number of units of a product sold in all of its forms (i.e., various sizes) must be less than the applicable
number of units for the exemption. For example, a firm may manufacture a beverage in 10-oz bottles, 12-oz cans, 16-oz
bottles, 1-liter (L) bottles, and 2&hyph;L bottles. In determining whether the beverage would be eligible for an
exemption, the firm would total the number of units of each of the various sizes of containers sold in the United States,
and if the total number of units for all five types of packages is less than the applicable amount, e.g., less than 600,000
in the case of proposed &sect;101.9(j)(18)(i)(A), then the beverage would be eligible for exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Food product.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The agency is proposing to define in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(vi)(B) and 101.36(f)(2)(vi)(B) the terms ``food
product'' and ``food product that is a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals'' to mean ``food in any sized package
which is manufactured by a single manufacturer or which bears the same brand name, which bears the same statement of
identity, and which has similar preparation methods.'' This definition reflects section 403(q)(5)(E)(vi)(II)
of the act. Whether two units of a food are units of the same food product or are units of different food products for the
purposes of proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18) and 101.36(f)(2) depends on how they compare under the factors listed
in this definition. If two units of a food are the same under each of these three factors, then they would represent two
units of the same food product. However, if the two units of a food differ in one or more respects under these three factors,
then they would represent one unit of two different food products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the terms ``single manufacturer'' and ``same brand name'' are self-explanatory, the agency believes that
it is useful to provide more detail on the terms ``statement of identity'' and ``similar method of preparation'' and
to provide some examples of the relationship between units and food products. In discussing the definition for statement
of identity, the Statement of Explanation for H.R. 2900 explains that by statement of identity, it intended that FDA
use the definition of ``statement of identity'' in its regulations under &sect;101.3(b) (21 CFR 101.3(b)) (139 Congressional
Record H6358 (August 6, 1993)). Section 101.3(b) provides that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Such statement of identity shall be in terms of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The name now or hereafter specified in or required by any applicable Federal law or regulation; or, in the absence
thereof, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The common or usual name of the food; or, in the absence thereof, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An appropriately descriptive term, or when the nature of the food is obvious, a fanciful name commonly used by the
public for such food. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, under proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18) and 101.36(f)(2), in determining whether a food is the same food
product as another food for determining the number of units sold, a firm should refer to &sect;101.3(b) to determine
whether the two foods have the same statement of identity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency interprets the term ``similar preparation methods'' to extend to all aspects in the manufacture of the
food product, from the initial steps of determining the ingredients to be used, i.e., formulation, to interim treatment
steps of the ingredients, such as blanching, to all of the various steps used in the processing of the finished food
to be sold to the consumer. Because each of these steps may have an effect on the nutrient content of the finished food
product, units of foods that differ with respect to particular steps in their manufacture should be considered by
a firm to constitute units of different food products for the purpose of its determining the approximate number of
units of food products sold in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency provides the following examples to describe the circumstances in which two units of a food would be two units
of the same food product, or, alternatively, one unit each of two different food products: A firm would count two units
of a food with the same statement of identity and similar methods of preparation as two units of the same product if they
both bear the same brand name even though they were manufactured by two different firms. A private label manufacturer
would have to count as units of the same food all production with the same statement of identity (presuming similar
method of preparation) even if it is packing the food products under the brand names of five different firms. On the
other hand, even if two units of food are made by the same firm (or have the same brand name) and have the same statement
of identity, they would not count as units of the same food product if there were differences in their method of preparation,
such that the nutrition profiles of the two products are different, (one ice cream product was made with nuts and the
other was not) or different manufacturing processes were used (e.g., one was canned while the other was frozen).

The agency is proposing to define in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(vi)(C) and 101.36(f)(2)(vi)(C) the term ``person''
to mean ``all domestic and foreign affiliates of the corporation, in the case of a corporation.'' This aspect of the
definition reflects section 403(q)(5)(E)(vi)(III) of the act. FDA is also proposing to include within the coverage
of this term companies that are not corporations by including the following language in these regulations: ``*&blank;*&blank;*
and all affiliates of that firm or other entity, when referring to a firm or other entity that is not a corporation.''
Section 201(e) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(e)) defines ``person'' as including an individual, partnership, corporation,
and association.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1993 amendments, Congress clarified the definition of ``person'' to remove any ambiguity as to the entities
that a corporation should include in determining the average number of its full-time equivalent employees. Congress
said the employees of each of its affiliates should be counted by a corporation. The agency is proposing to include
the sentence noted above in its regulation to provide parallel coverage of persons that are not corporations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(vi)(D) and 101.36(f)(2)(vi)(D) to define the term ``full-time
equivalent employee'' to mean all individuals employed by the person claiming the exemption and to establish a formula
for use by a person to calculate the average number of its full-time equivalent employees. The agency is proposing
that the average number of full-time equivalent employees of a company be determined by dividing the total number
of hours of salary or wages paid to individuals that render services to a company by the number of hours of work in a year,
2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours &times; 52 weeks). Under this formula, a person would base the average number of full-time
equivalent employees on a typical work-year and on the total hours worked by individuals employed by the firm and,
as noted above, by all of its affiliates. The average number of full-time equivalent employees would be calculated
based on all employees of a firm, including production workers, office staff, salesmen, and distribution staff,
including any contract personnel. Under the proposed formula, a foreign firm, as well as a domestic firm, will have
to calculate the average number of its full-time equivalent employees based on the total numbers of individuals employed
by that firm and its affiliates, regardless of whether their operations are related to sales of food products in the
United States.

2. Small Business Food Labeling Exemption Notice
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1993 amendments provide that the exemption contained in section 403(q)(5)(E) of the act shall only be available
to a person that files a notice with FDA to claim the exemption for one or more of its low-volume food products before
the beginning of the 12-month period during which the exemption is to be in effect. The agency is proposing requirements
concerning the filing of this notice in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iv) and 101.36(f)(2)(iv). In addition to the
name and address of the firm claiming exemption for certain of its food products, under the proposed regulations,
the notice must include the average number of full-time equivalent employees of the firm, and, for each food product
for which an exemption is claimed, the approximate number of units sold by the firm over the 12-month period preceding
the period for which the exemption is claimed. FDA intends to treat all information received in such notices in accordance
with its public information regulations, 21 CFR part 20, particularly &sect;20.61 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trade secrets and commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon the filing of the notice establishing that a product meets the requirements for an exemption, the food product
will be exempt from the requirements for nutrition labeling specified in &sect;101.9 or &sect;101.36 during the
12-month period for which the exemption is claimed. There is no requirement for agency action, review, or approval
before the exemption is effective.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recognizing that a person is subject to criminal liability for submitting false information to the Federal Government
(18 U.S.C. 1001), FDA is proposing to require that a notice of claimed small business exemption contain a signed certification
of the accuracy of the submission by a responsible individual for the company submitting the notice (proposed &sect;101.9(j)(18)(iv)(F)
and &sect;101.36(f)(2)(iv)(F). Additional information to support the validity of the information provided in
the notice may be required under section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act provides that a notice of a claimed small business exemption shall ``contain
such information'' as FDA (by delegation from the Secretary) may require ``to verify the information required''
about the number of full-time equivalent employees and unit sales of food products if the agency ``has questioned
the validity of such information.'' Because the notice cannot include information that FDA has not yet required_that
is, that FDA has not yet identified as necessary to verify the information in the notice_a two-step process is necessary
to implement this provision. The agency must first review the notice and decide whether any verifying information
is necessary and then be given access to that information. The agency is considering defining in this rulemaking the
procedure through which it will obtain the verifying information that the statute clearly states that it may require.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information in the notice could be verified either by requiring the submission of supporting documentation or by
inspecting that documentation at a firm's place of business. In some circumstances, inspection of records will be
more practicable than submission, and vice versa. FDA is thus considering requiring that any company that claims
the small business exemption provide the agency with access to its records that support the information contained
in the exemption notice if the agency finds that such access is necessary to verify the information contained in the
notice. In some situations, the agency may instead require the submission of supporting information to the agency.
FDA tentatively finds that it has ample legal authority to impose these requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 371(a)), FDA has the authority to adopt by regulation requirements that
are necessary for the efficient enforcement of the act, including section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act. (See

569 F.2d 690, 693 &amp; n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1978).) Implementing section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act through the
sole method of requiring submission of verifying information to the agency could be unduly burdensome for both the
agency and the companies claiming the small business exemption. For example, the agency could determine, under section
403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act, that information in a particular notice must be verified by examining a firm's
payroll records and invoices. Copying all of these documents and submitting them to the agency could present difficulty
for a small business claiming the exemption. This difficulty could be avoided if FDA examined the relevant documents
at the firm's premises. Moreover, verifying the information contained in notice of claimed exemption by inspecting
documents at the firm's place of business, and copying only those needed, would in many cases be a more efficient use
of the agency's investigational resources. This approach is consistent with FDA's actions in other areas where it
has required that records be made available to agency employees. (See, e.g., 21 CFR 108.25(g) (acidified foods);
108.35(h) (thermal processing of low-acid foods); 172.320 (amino acids).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency points out that its contemplated approach is fully consistent with Congress' desire, as reflected in the
legislative history of the 1993 amendments, that the small business exemption be obtained in a simple and straightforward
manner without complicated reporting. (See 139 Congressional Record E 2016 (August 5, 1993) (statement of Rep. Dingell)
(``The system is a simple one that does not require complicated reporting or a response from FDA.''); see also 139 Cong.
Rec. S 10817 (August 6, 1993) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) (The 1993 amendments ``provide[] a straightforward system
under which a company simply notifies the FDA that one or more of its products qualify for an exemption''); id. at S 10818
(statement of Sen. Hatch).) Under the approach that the agency is considering, a company would merely have to file
a simple notice with the agency. It would then be up to the agency to determine whether any matter needs verification
and to take steps to view the documentation required to verify the relevant information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA requests comments on the approach described above. Based on its review of the comments, the agency may provide
in the final rule that companies claiming the exemption will be required to permit inspection of supporting documentation
or to submit any required information to the agency, as appropriate. Given the late date of this proposal, however,
the agency would not make these requirements effective for notices of exemption for 1994&hyph;95. Many small firms,
in contemplation of the fact that most small businesses must file a notice, have already filed notices without any
indication from the agency as to how it intends to enforce the implementation requirements. Because FDA believes
that people should have full notice of the requirements that will apply to them when they file a notice of exemption,
and because requiring small firms to refile based on any final rule would significantly undercut the efficient enforcement
purposes of a records access requirement, FDA would make these requirements applicable to notices seeking exemption
beginning with the period from May 8, 1995, to May 7, 1996. Nevertheless, companies filing for an exemption would still
be subject to the statutory requirement in section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act, and, although the procedural
requirements for complying with this section would not be effective until 1995, companies should still be prepared
to provide information to FDA to support their notices of exemption should FDA question the validity of any information
contained in those notices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reflecting new section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii) of the act, the agency is providing in proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iv)
and 101.36(f)(2)(iv) that a firm that is not an importer and that has an average of fewer than 10 full-time equivalent
employees does not have to file notice for any product for which it has sales of less than 10,000 units in any year for
it to be eligible for the small business exemption for that product. The agency would suggest, however, that such a
company submit a notice to the Office of Food Labeling (HFS&hyph;150), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition,
Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, to establish a record that it is claiming a small
business exemption for some or all of its products. (The Office of Food Labeling is the office within FDA that has responsibility
for food labeling issues.) The agency intends to make available to FDA and State enforcement offices a list of the names
and addresses of firms that have claimed the small business exemption and the names of the products for which they have
claimed the exemption. The agency intends to include on this list the names of firms that have fewer than 10 employees
and sales of fewer than 10,000 units of a particular product. Such firms are not required to file a notice but can choose
to do so voluntarily. FDA believes that the appearance of a product's name on the list will eliminate any questions
about its eligibility for an exemption. Thus, even though not required, the submission of a notice of a claimed small
business exemption for a food product may be in the best interest of a firm. FDA also intends to include in the list the
names of firms eligible for the small business exemption provided in &sect;&sect;101.109(j)(1)(i) and 101.36(f)(2)(i)
if they file notice with the Office of Food Labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All notices must be filed by May 7, 1994, for the 12-month period beginning May 8, 1994, the date that the new mandatory
nutrition labeling regulations become effective. The notice is to be filed with the Office of Food Labeling (address
above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that time is growing short for the filing of notices to FDA, and that firms may be anxious to file the notice
for claimed exemption. As an interim measure and to assure that all necessary information is submitted, FDA suggests
that firms follow the procedures proposed in this document if they file a notice with FDA before the agency issues final
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because it has received numerous inquiries as to whether a form exists for the submission of the notice, FDA is providing
in Appendix I of this document, a model form, along with instructions for completing it in Appendix II of this document.
This model form may be used by firms to supply notice of their claimed exemptions. FDA advises, however, that it is not
necessary to use this form. The agency also advises that the small business exemption for a food product will be in effect
once a notice has been filed with FDA, even though it may be necessary for the Office of Food Labeling to work with the
firm that is filing the notice to address deficiencies in the notice. Although no action by the agency is required,
FDA will attempt to review all notices to ensure that they are complete and to notify companies of the receipt of the
notice, and whether additional information needs to be submitted.

3. Eligibility for the Small Business Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In proposed &sect;&sect;101.9 (j)(18)(i) and (j)(18)(ii) and in 101.36 (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii), FDA is incorporating
into its regulations the statutory limits on the number of units sold that would qualify a food product as a low-volume
food product eligible for exemption from the nutrition labeling requirements established by section 403(q)(1)
and (q)(2) of the act. Proposed &sect;&sect;101.9 (j)(18)(i) and (j)(18)(ii) and 101.36 (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii)
also reflect the statutory limits on a firm's average number of full-time equivalent employees that would qualify
it as a small business whose products are eligible for an exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The act provides for phased-in coverage of foods that were first introduced into interstate commerce before May 8,
1994. Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(ii)(I) of the act, a food product is eligible for exemption from the nutrition labeling
requirements from May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, if fewer than 600,000 units of that product were sold in the United States
between May 8, 1993, and May 7, 1994, and the person claiming the exemption for that product employed fewer than an average
of 300 full-time equivalent employees during that time. The agency recognizes that there are some products that will
have come onto the market before May 8, 1994, for which there will not be a full year of sales on which to determine whether
they qualify for an exemption as a low-volume food. The agency is proposing that a food for which there is not 12 months
of sales before May 8, 1994, will qualify as a low-volume food eligible for an exemption if the sales of the food during
the period in which the exemption will apply, May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, are reasonably anticipated to be less than
600,000 units. This treatment of products sold before May 8, 1994, but without a full year of sales history before that
date, is consistent with that of products not sold in the 12-month period before an exemption is claimed under section
403(q)(5)(E)(i)(IV) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to provide for this exemption in &sect;101.9(j)(18)(i)(A). The agency notes that this proposed
provision is not applicable to dietary supplements of herbs and other similar nutritional substances, and that FDA
is not proposing to include a parallel provision in &sect;101.36(f) for dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals,
because the mandatory labeling requirements do not become effective for dietary supplements until July 1, 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(ii)(II) of the act, the exemption for a food first introduced into interstate commerce
before May 8, 1994, narrows in the second year that section 403(q) of the act is applicable. Such a food will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be eligible for exemption from nutrition labeling between May 8, 1995, and May 7, 1996, only if there were
fewer than 400,000 units of that product sold in the United States between May 8, 1994, and May 7, 1995, and if the firm
that claims an exemption for the product employed an average of fewer than 300 full-time equivalent employees during
that period. The agency is proposing to reflect this provision in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(i)(B) and 101.36(f)(2)(i)(A)
of its regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption narrows even further in the third year. Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(ii)(III) of the act, a food introduced
into interstate commerce before May 8, 1994, is eligible for exemption from the requirements for nutrition labeling
between May 8, 1996, and May 7, 1997, if there were fewer than 200,000 units of that food product sold in the United States,
and if the firm that claims an exemption for such product employed an average of less than 200 full-time equivalent
employees, between May 8, 1995, and May 7, 1996. The agency is proposing to reflect this provision in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(i)(C)
and 101.36(f)(2)(i)(B) of its regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(i) of the act, all other food products are eligible for exemption from the requirements
for nutrition labeling in section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2) of the act for any 12-month period if there were fewer than 100,000
units of that food product sold in the United States during the preceding 12 months by the firm claiming the exemption,
and if that firm employed an average of less than 100 full-time equivalent employees during that preceding 12-month
period. Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(i) of the act, newly marketed food is eligible for exemption if fewer than 100,000
units of that food product are reasonably anticipated to be sold, and if the firm claiming the exemption employs an
average of less than 100 full-time equivalent employees, during the 12-month period for which the exemption is claimed.
The agency is proposing to reflect these provisions in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(ii) and 101.36(f)(2)(ii) of its
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If adopted, the proposed regulations will operate in the following way: A person with an average of 250 full-time equivalent
employees between May 8, 1993, and May 8, 1994, may file a notice with FDA claiming an exemption from the requirements
of &sect;101.9 for the period from May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, for each of its products whose sales were less than 600,000
units during the period from May 8, 1993, to May 7, 1994. The filing of the notice will serve to establish the exemption
for the food product (assuming no nutrition information or health or nutrient content claims are provided in the labeling
of the product). If a product were not offered for sale for the entire year preceding May 8, 1994, the firm could claim
a small business exemption for that food product if the number of units of that product sold in the United States during
the time period from May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, is reasonably anticipated to be fewer than 600,000 units.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If that firm continues to have less than 300 employees, e.g., 275 full-time equivalent employees, for the period of
May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, it may file by May 7, 1995, a new notice to claim an exemption for the period from May 8, 1995,
to May 7, 1996, for any product for which it sold less than 400,000 units in the United States during the period of May
8, 1994, to May 7, 1995 and where labeling does not bear nutrition information or health or nutrient content claims.
However, if the firm continues to have more than 200 full-time equivalent employees for the time period of May 8, 1995,
to May 7, 1996, the firm will not be eligible to claim a small business exemption for its products after May 8, 1996. Under
section 403(q)(5)(E)(iv) of the act, within 18 months after that date, it will have to bring the labels of its products
into compliance with the provisions of &sect;&sect;101.9 and 101.36. On the other hand, a firm with less than 200 full-time
equivalent employees during the period of May 8, 1995, to May 7, 1996, e.g., 175 employees, would be eligible to file
a notice by May 7, 1996, to claim a small business exemption for the time period May 8, 1996, to May 7, 1997, for any product
that was on the market before May 8, 1994, and of which it sold fewer than 200,000 units during the period of May 8, 1995,
to May 7, 1996. Only those firms having less than 100 full-time equivalent employees would be able to file a notice to
claim a small business exemption for a 12-month period after May 8, 1997, and then only for products having approximate
annual sales of less than 100,000 units.

Under proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(ii) and 101.36(f)(2)(ii), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a person that is planning to introduce a new food product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into interstate commerce effective August 1, 1994, (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after May 8, 1994) and that has, for example, an average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 50 full-time equivalent employees (during the period of August 1, 1993, to August 1, 1994) may file a notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with FDA by July 31, 1994, claiming an exemption for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product from the requirements of &sect;&sect;101.9 or 101.36 for the period from August 1, 1994, until July 31, 1995,
if it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably anticipates selling fewer than 100,000 units of that product during the period from August 1, 1994, to
July 31, 1995. As discussed above, the filing of the notice serves to establish the exemption for the food product.
If the firm continues to have less than 100 employees, e.g., only 55 full-time equivalent employees, and continues
to sell less than 100,000 units of the product in the United States, the firm will be able to annually claim an exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The agency is proposing in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iii) and 101.36(f)(2)(iii), consistent with the provisions
of section 403(q)(5)(E)(iv) of the act, that a small business exemption for a product shall expire 18 months after
the date on which the average number of full-time equivalent employees or number of units of food products sold in the
United States exceed the numbers necessary for a food to be eligible for an exemption. For example, under the provisions
of proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iii) and 101.36(f)(2)(iii), an exemption for a low-volume food product
for the time period between May 8, 1994, and May 7, 1995, expires 18 months after the date on which sales of that food product
exceed 600,000 units, or the average number of full-time equivalent employees of the firm claiming the exemption
exceeds 300. Alternatively, the exemption shall expire 18 months after the ending date of the 12-month period that
the food product was exempt under &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18) or 101.36(f)(2). This provision will provide to a small
business approximately the same amount of time after the eligibility for exemption ends that firms that did not qualify
for a small business exemption had to bring the labels of their products into compliance with section 403(q) of the
act after the publication of final rules implementing that section of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iv) and 101.36(f)(2)(iv) to require that the certification
statement include a commitment on the part of the person claiming an exemption that he or she will notify FDA if the number
of units of a food product sold, or the average number of full-time equivalent employees employed, by the person exceeds
the applicable numbers. Having made such a commitment, a failure to notify the agency that the food is no longer eligible
would subject the person to action under Title 18 of the United States Code.

Section 403(q)(5)(E)(v) of the act provides that FDA may by regulation lower the requirements pertaining to the average
number of full-time equivalent employees or the number of units of food products requirements for eligibility for
exemption for any food product first introduced into interstate commerce after May 8, 2002. Under the act, before
FDA can lower these requirements, it must determine that the cost of compliance with the lower requirements will not
place an undue burden on persons that would be affected by the lower requirements. FDA is proposing to reflect this
provision in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(v) and 101.36(f)(2)(v) of its regulations.

III. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the economic impact of the proposed rule as required by Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives
and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential
economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). The Regulatory
Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) requires agencies to analyze options for regulatory relief for small businesses.
The agency finds that the only significant economic effect of this rule is the benefit that it creates by reducing labeling
costs for newly exempted companies. This benefit is the result of statutory provisions and not FDA discretion. However,
because this benefit is large and affects small businesses, we are providing the following voluntary economic impact
analysis and regulatory flexibility analysis that meet the requirements of Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two types of costs in this regulation: (1) Costs to comply with the notification requirement, and (2) costs
of lost nutrition benefits. FDA estimates that the volume of food products produced by manufacturers, packers, or
distributors eligible for the exemption being proposed in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18) and 101.36(f)(2) constitutes
less than 1 percent of the U.S. diet. Thus, any lost nutrition benefits are likely to be small. The 1993 amendments require
that any small firm (except for very small firms with very low-volume food products) that has low-volume food products
that are eligible for exemption from nutrition labeling notify FDA of the volume of sales of such products and the number
of its full-time equivalent employees if the product is to be exempt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some firms will not have products that are eligible for the new small business exemption, and some will not take advantage
of the exemption from nutrition labeling for one of the following reasons: (1) They make nutrient content claims,
(2) they make health claims, (3) they decide to label to be competitive with other labeled products, or (4) retailers
they sell to insist on nutrition labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming that 50 percent of all firms that could claim the small business exemption will decide not to do so for one of
the reasons listed above and will, as a result, provide nutrition labeling for their products, it is estimated that
approximately 4,500 firms will remain that have products that are eligible for exemption and not label their products
with nutrition labeling in the first 2 years during which nutrition labeling is required by &sect;&sect;101.9 and
101.36. The agency further estimates that this figure will reduce to 4,000 firms for the third year during which nutrition
labeling is required and to 3,200 firms for subsequent years. Those firms that choose not to label will be responsible
for annually gathering sales and employee data and notifying FDA of their claim for exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, firms will have to read and analyze the regulation. Second, they will have to determine the average number of
full-time equivalent employees they employed in the previous year. Because most firms keep payroll records of expenses
only, this will require some conversion. Third, firms will have to determine which of their products qualify for exemption.
Again, records of dollar sales are normally kept and, as prices may have changed throughout the year, some analysis
may be required for each product that the firm believes to be exempt. This activity may be reasonably expected to take
an average of 8 hours per firm although FDA solicits comment on this figure. If costs to perform this activity (plus
overhead) average approximately $46 per hour (the value used by FDA in calculating costs for reporting under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980), then the first year costs to firms that decide to file a notice of exception are expected to be
approximately $1,656,000. This cost will drop to approximately $1,472,000 and $1,177,640 in subsequent years as
the number of firms filing a notice decreases as discussed above. The proposed rule reflects the statute's removal
of coverage for manufacturers, packers, and distributors under the exemption based on gross value of sales or business
done after May 8, 1995. The agency believes that this will result in minimal cost to industry because almost all firms
that might have been covered by that exemption will be covered by the new exemption provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal costs for implementing the notification system in terms of setting up the system, handling mail, recording
firms and products, and providing information concerning exempted firms will approximate $207,000. Thus, it is
reasonable to expect that total costs of the notification provision will be less than $2 million for the first year
and decrease substantially in subsequent years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefits of this regulation are likely to be very large. First, many small manufacturers noted the impossibility
of labeling their low-volume products in comments to the rule.

Assuming that the costs of labeling are about $3,000 per product and that there is an average of 20 products per firm,
cost savings from not labeling the products that are exempt are estimated to be between $275 million and $360 million.
In addition, this law and regulation prevent both the lost value to consumers of products that would no longer be available
and the costs of losing many small businesses.

IV. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24 (a)(8) and (a)(11) that this action is of a type that does not individually
or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment
nor an environmental impact statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed actions pertaining to food labeling meet the criteria in 21 CFR 25.24(a)(11) for exclusion from preparation
of an environmental assessment and an environmental impact statement. The proposed regulations pertaining to the
small business notification procedure meet the criteria for exclusion described in 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8).

V. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule contains information collections that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Therefore, in accordance with 5 CFR part 1320, the
title, description, and respondent description of the information requirements are shown below with an estimate
of the annual collection and information burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering necessary information, and completion and submission of the request.

Food Labeling; Nutrition Labeling, Small Business Exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provides the procedures for the submission of a notice of a claim by a company of an exemption from
FDA's regulations for mandatory nutrition labeling. FDA action on the notice will be limited to review for completeness
and acknowledgement that the notice had been received and was or was not adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 amendments revise the basis for a small business exemption provided by section 403(q)(5) of the act. This
new provision, section 403(q)(5)(E) of the act, provides an exemption for a food product based on the number of employees
of the company and the number of units sold on an annual basis. Under the 1993 amendments, to qualify for an exemption,
a person must file the notice mentioned in the preceding paragraph with FDA before the time period for the claimed exemption.
Proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iv) and 101.36(f)(2)(iv) reflect the information identified in section 403(q)(5)(E)
of the act as necessary as part of the notice for a claimed small business exemption.

The agency expects that the number of respondents and corresponding annual burden hours will decrease over succeeding
years as the basis for additional exemptions changes. By May 1997, FDA estimates that approximately 3,200 companies
may be filing notices to claim the exemption with a corresponding annual burden hours of approximately 25,600 hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has submitted copies of the proposed rule to OMB for its review of these recordkeeping requirements. Interested
persons are requested to send comments regarding this estimated burden, including suggestions for reducing this
burden to FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above), and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
OMB, rm. 3208, New Executive Bldg., Washington, DC 20503, ATTN: Desk Officer for FDA.

VI. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Because of the shortness of time until the date on which notices must be filed with the agency to claim the new exemptions,
FDA is proposing to make these regulations effective on the date of publication of the final rules in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As stated above, FDA tentatively concludes that it has good cause for this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons may, on or before May 13, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the shortness of the time until firms must begin filing notice of claimed exemptions with the agency, FDA
will not be able to extend the comment period beyond that date. Also, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is advising that it may not be able to consider any comments received at the Dockets Management Branch after
the close of business on May 13, 1994.

firm that is claiming the exemption; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The number of full-time equivalent employees. Provide the average number of full-time equivalent individuals
employed by the person and its affiliates for the 12 months preceding the period for which a small business exemption
is claimed for a product. The number of full-time equivalent employees is to be determined by dividing the total number
of hours of salary or wages paid to individuals that render services to the company by the number of hours of work in a
year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours&times;52 weeks); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Approximate total number of units of the food product sold in the United States in the 12-month period preceding
that for which a small business exemption is claimed: Provide the approximate total number of units sold, or expected
to be sold, in a 12-month period for each product for which an exemption is claimed. For products that have been in production
for 1 year or more before the period for which exemption is claimed, the 12-month period is the period immediately preceding
the period for which an exemption is claimed. For other products, the 12-month period is the period for which an exemption
is claimed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The notice shall be signed by a responsible individual for the person who can certify the accuracy of the information
presented in the notice. The individual shall certify that the information contained in the notice is a complete and
accurate statement of the number of full-time equivalent employees of the firm and its affiliates and of the number
of units of the product for which an exemption is claimed sold by the firm. The individual shall also state that should
the average number of full-time equivalent employees or the number of units of the food products sold in the United
States by the firm exceed the applicable numbers for the time period for which exemption is claimed; the firm will notify
FDA of that fact and of the date on which the number of employees or number of products sold included the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) FDA may by regulation lower the employee or units of food products requirements of paragraph (j)(18)(ii) of this
section for any food product first introduced into interstate commerce after May 8, 2002, if the agency determines
that the cost of compliance with such lower requirement will not place an undue burden on persons subject to it.

(ii) For purposes of this paragraph, calculation of the amount of sales shall be based on the most recent 2-year average
of business activity. Where firms have been in business less than 2 years, reasonable estimates must indicate that
annual sales will not exceed the amounts specified. For foreign firms that ship food into the United States, the business
activities to be included shall be the total amount of food sales, as well as other sales to consumers, by the firm in
the United States.

(2) Dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals that are low-volume food products (that is, they meet the requirements
for units sold in paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(ii) of this section); that, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)
of this section, are the subject of a claim for an exemption that provides the information required under paragraph
(f)(2)(iv) of this section, that is filed before the beginning of the time period for which the exemption is claimed,
and that is filed by a person that qualifies to claim the exemption under the requirements for average full-time equivalent
employees in paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(ii) of this section; and whose labels, labeling, and advertising do not
provide nutrition information or make a nutrient content or health claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For food products that are dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals first introduced into interstate commerce
before May 8, 1994, the supplement shall be exempt for the period:

exemption employed fewer than an average of 200 full-time equivalent employees and fewer than 200,000 units of that
product were sold in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For all other food products that are dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals, the supplement shall be eligible
for an exemption for any 12-month period if, for the preceding 12 months, the person claiming the exemption employed
fewer than an average of 100 full-time equivalent employees and fewer than 100,000 units of that product were sold
in the United States, or in the case of a dietary supplement that was not sold in the 12-month period preceding the period
for which exemption is claimed, fewer than 100,000 units of such product are reasonably anticipated to be sold in the
United States during the period for which exemption is claimed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If a person claims an exemption under paragraphs (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(ii) of this section for a dietary supplement
food product and then, during the period of such exemption, the number of full-time equivalent employees of such person
exceeds the appropriate number, or the number of units of the dietary supplement sold in the United States exceeds
the appropriate number, or, if at the end of the period of such exemption, the dietary supplement no longer qualifies
for an exemption under the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(ii) of this section, such person shall have
18 months from the date that the supplement no longer qualified as a low-volume food product of a small business to comply
with this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A notice shall be filed with the Office of Food Labeling (HFS&hyph;150), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition,
Food and Drug Administration, 200 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20204 and contain the following information, except
that if the person is not an importer and has fewer than 10 full-time equivalent employees, that person does not have
to file a notice for any dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals with annual sales of fewer than 10,000 total units:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Name and address of firm requesting exemption;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Names of the food products (including the various brand names) for which exemption is claimed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Name and address of the manufacturer of the food products for which an exemption is claimed, if different than the
firm that is claiming the exemption;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The number of full-time equivalent employees. Provide the average number of full-time equivalent individuals
employed by the person and its affiliates for the 12 months preceding the period for which a small business exemption
is claimed for a product. The number of full-time equivalent employees is to be determined by dividing the total number
of hours of salary or wages paid to individuals that render services to the company by the number of hours of work in a
year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours x 52 weeks);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Approximate total number of units of the food product that is a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals sold
in the United States in the 12-month period preceding that for which a small business exemption is claimed. Provide
the approximate total number of units sold, or expected to be sold, in a 12-month period for each product for which an
exemption is claimed. For products that have been in production for more than 1 year before the period for which exemption
is claimed, the 12-month period should be the period preceding the period for which an exemption is claimed. For other
products, the 12-month period should be the period for which an exemption is claimed; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The notice shall be signed by a responsible individual for the person who can certify the accuracy of the information
presented in the notice. The individual shall certify that the information contained in the notice is a complete and
accurate statement of the number of full-time equivalent employees of the firm and its affiliates and of the number
of units of the product for which an exemption is claimed sold by the firm. The individual shall also state that should
the average number of full-time equivalent employees or the number of units of the food product sold in the United States
by the firm exceed the applicable numbers for the time period for which exemption is claimed, the firm will notify FDA
of that fact and of the date on which the number of employees or number of products sold exceeded the standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) FDA may by regulation lower the employee or units of a food product that is a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals
requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section for any product first introduced into interstate commerce
after May 8, 2002, if the agency determines that the cost of compliance with such lower requirement will not place an
undue burden on persons subject to it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions apply:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340, ``Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering
Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests,'' require a person to obtain a permit before
introducing (importing, moving interstate, or releasing into the environment) into the United States certain genetically
engineered organisms and products that are considered ``regulated articles.'' The regulations set forth procedures
for obtaining a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article, and for obtaining a limited permit
for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 7(f) and 7A of the Act were amended by the U.S. Grain Standards Act Amendments of 1993 (Public Law 103&hyph;156)
on November 24, 1993, to authorize FGIS' Administrator to conduct pilot programs allowing more than one official
agency to provide official services within a single geographic area without undermining the declared policy of the
Act. The purpose of the pilot programs is to evaluate the impact of allowing more than one official agency to provide
official services within a single geographic area. FGIS is considering several possible pilot programs and may conduct
one or more pilot programs. Official agencies selected by FGIS to participate in a pilot program would be allowed to
provide official services in specified areas during the test period, and these agencies would provide FGIS with information
on such official services. Following the pilot programs, FGIS would evaluate the impact of allowing more than one
official agency to provide service within a single geographic area. FGIS is considering the following possible pilot
programs and may select one or more of these or other suggested pilot programs for a test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. Barges on selected rivers or portions of rivers as defined by FGIS. Agencies would be allowed to provide official
services for barges at these locations in addition to the agency already designated to serve these locations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Exceptions. Agencies having exceptions to their assigned geographic areas would be allowed to provide official
services at these specified locations in addition to the official agency already designated to serve these points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Commercial inspection services. Agencies would be allowed to provide official commercial inspection services
outside their assigned geographic areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Submitted samples. Agencies would be allowed to enter another agency's assigned area to pick up submitted samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Timeliness of service. If an official agency can not provide the requested services within 12 hours of the request,
the applicant may request such services from another official agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters are encouraged to submit reasons and pertinent data for support or objection to the pilot programs described
above. FGIS is also requesting suggestions regarding other possible pilot programs in addition to or in lieu of those
listed above. All comments and suggestions must be submitted to the Compliance Division at the above address.

The Food and Nutrition Service is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and has determined
that it is not a ``significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, it has been determined
that this action: (1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in
a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not materially alter the budgetary impact of
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would
not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set
forth in Executive Order 12866.

The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set
forth in the Final rule and related Notice to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V (48 FR 29116, June 24, 1983), this program is excluded
from the scope of Executive Order No. 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

William E. Ludwig, the Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified that this action will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The action will increase the amount of money
spent on food through increases in food stamp benefits issued to participating households. However, this money will
be distributed among the nation's food vendors as the food stamps are used by households, so the effect on any one vendor
will not be significant.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) and Allotments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The TFP is a plan for the consumption of foods of different types (food groups) that families might use to provide nutritious
meals and snacks for family members. The plan suggests amounts of food for men, women, and children of different ages,
and it meets most dietary standards. The cost of the TFP is adjusted monthly to reflect changes in the costs of the food
groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TFPs for Alaska and Hawaii are based upon an adjusted average for the six-month period that ends with June 1993. Since
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the source of food price data) no longer publishes monthly information to compute
Alaska and Hawaii TFPs, the adjusted average provides a proxy for actual June 1993 TFP costs. The adjusted average
is equal to January&hyph;June 1993 TFP costs for Alaska and Hawaii increased by the average percentage difference
between the cost of the TFP in Alaska and Hawaii in June and the January&hyph;June average from 1976 through 1986 (a
1.53 percent increase over January&hyph;June costs in Alaska and a 1.82 percent increase in Hawaii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the period January through June 1993, the average cost of the TFP was $467.70 in Alaska and $596 in Hawaii. The proxies
for actual June 1993 TFP costs were $474.86 in Alaska and $606.85 in Hawaii. The June 1993 cost of the TFP was $587.70
in Guam and $469.10 in the Virgin islands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TFP is also the basis for establishing food stamp allotments. Food stamp allotments are adjusted periodically
to reflect changes in food cost levels. Section 3(o)(11) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2012(o)(11))
provides for an adjustment on October 1, 1993, based upon 103 percent of the June 1993 cost of the TFP for a family of four
persons consisting of a man and woman ages 20&hyph;50 and children ages 6&hyph;8 and 9&hyph;11.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The maximum food stamp benefit or allotment is paid to households which have no net income. For households which have
some income, their allotment is determined by reducing the maximum allotment for their household size by 30% of the
household's net income. To obtain the maximum food stamp allotment for each household size, the TFP costs for the four-person
household were increased by 3 percent, divided by four, multiplied by the appropriate household size and economy
of scale factor, and the final result was rounded down to the nearest dollar.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 3(o)(3) of the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2012(o)(3)), maximum food stamp benefits for Guam and the
Virgin Islands cannot exceed those in the 50 States and D.C., so they are based upon the lower of their respective TFPs
or the TFP for rural II Alaska. In addition, the urban Alaska allotment is the higher of the allotment that was in effect
in urban areas on October 1, 1985 or 100.79 percent of the adjusted Anchorage TFP (see 50 FR 18456, dated May 1, 1984,
and 51 FR 16281, dated May 2, 1986).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to regulations published at 51 FR 16281, on May 2, 1986, the allotment for rural I areas is the higher of the
allotment that was in effect in each rural I area on October 1, 1985 or 128.52 percent of the Anchorage TFP (as adjusted).
The rural II allotment is 156.42 percent of the adjusted Anchorage TFP (Alaska TFP). For further information concerning
the allotments for urban Alaska, rural I Alaska, and rural II Alaska, see 51 FR 16281, dated May 2, 1986.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Nutrition Service is issuing this notice in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and has determined
that it is an ``economically significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department,
it has been determined that this action will increase Food Stamp Program's cost by more than $100 million. It will not
result in a major increase in costs or prices except to the Federal Government, nor will it affect competition, productivity,
employment, investment or innovation.

The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set
forth in the final rule related notice to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29116, June 24, 1983), this program is excluded
from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

William E. Ludwig, the Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified that this action will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The action will increase the amount of money
spent on food through food stamps. However, this money will be distributed among the nation's food vendors, so the
effect on any one vendor will not be significant.

Need for Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action is required by sections 3(o) (1) and (11), 5(c), and 5(e)(4) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C.
secs. 2012(o) (1) and (11), 2014(c), and 2014(e) the ``Food Stamp Act''). Section 3(o)(11) requires that the October
1, 1993 change in food stamp allotments be based upon 103 percent of the June 1993 cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP)
for a family of four persons consisting of a man and woman ages 20&hyph;50 and children ages 6&hyph;8 and 9&hyph;11.
Adjustments are made to take into account household size, economies of scale and a requirement to round the final results
down to the nearest dollar increments. Section 5(c) requires that the income eligibility standards for the program
be adjusted on October 1, 1993 based on changes in the Federal income poverty guidelines. Section 5(e)(4) requires
that the standard deductions and the maximum amounts for the excess shelter expense deductions be adjusted on October
1, 1993 to the nearest lower dollar increments to reflect certain changes for the 12 months ending June 30, 1993. Section
13912 of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act, chapter 3 of P.L. 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Reconciliation
Act of 1993, amends section 5(e) by further raising the excess shelter expense deduction cap effective July 1, 1994.

Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is estimated that this action will increase the cost of the Food Stamp Program by approximately $652.6 million in
Fiscal Year 1994.

Income Eligibility Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The eligibility of households for the Food Stamp Program, except those in which all members are receiving public assistance
(PA) or supplemental security income benefits (SSI), is determined by comparing their incomes to the appropriate
income eligibility standards (limits). Households containing an elderly or disabled member need to have net incomes
below the net income limits, while households which do not contain an elderly or disabled member must have net incomes
below the net income limit and gross incomes below the gross income limit. Households in which all members are receiving
PA or SSI are categorically eligible; their incomes do not have to be below the income limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, elderly individuals (and their spouses) who are unable to prepare meals because of certain disabilities,
may be considered separate households, even if they are living and eating with another household. 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2012(i).
The Food Stamp Act limits separate household status to those persons who meet both of the following requirements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Their own income may not exceed the net income eligibility standards, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The income of those with whom they reside may not exceed 165 percent of the poverty line.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net and gross income limits are derived from the Federal income poverty guidelines. The net income limit is 100
percent of the guidelines; the gross income limit is 130 percent of the guidelines. The guidelines are updated annually.
Based on that update, the Food Stamp Program's income eligibility standards are updated annually. The effective
date of October 1 is required by the Food Stamp Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised income eligibility standards are as follows:

Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) and Allotments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The TFP is a plan for the consumption of foods of different types (food groups) that households might use to provide
nutritious meals and snacks for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household members. The plan suggests amounts of food for men, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women, and children of different ages, and it meets dietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. The cost of the TFP is adjusted annually to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in the costs of the food groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TFP is also the basis for establishing food stamp allotments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nationally, food stamp allotment levels are adjusted periodically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reflect changes in food cost levels. Section 3(o)(11) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2012(o)(11)), provides for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment on October 1, 1993, based upon 103 percent of the June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 cost of the TFP for a family of four persons consisting of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
man and woman ages 20&hyph;50 and children ages 6&hyph;8 and 9&hyph;11. In June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, the cost of the TFP was $364.90 in the 48 States and D.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To obtain the maximum food stamp benefit for each household size, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 1993 TFP costs for the four-person household (of $364.90) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were increased by 3 percent, divided by four, multiplied by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate household size and economy of scale factor, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final result was rounded down to the nearest dollar. The maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit, or allotment, is paid to households which have no net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income. For households which have some income, the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household's allotment is determined by reducing the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allotment for the household's size by 30 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual household's net income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following tables show the new allotments for the 48 States

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Food Stamp Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the $10 minimum monthly benefit provided to all one- and two-person households must be adjusted on each October 1 to
reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the percentage change in the TFP for the 12-month period ending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preceding June, with the result rounded to the nearest $5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to implement this provision of the law, the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit is adjusted each year as follows: (1) The percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in the TFP from June of the previous year to June of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current year (prior to rounding) is calculated; (2) this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage change is multiplied by the previous ``unrounded'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum benefit to obtain a new unrounded benefit amount; and (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the new unrounded minimum benefit is then rounded to the nearest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$5 in accordance with the statutory provisions.

The unrounded cost of the TFP was $355.55 in June 1992 and $364.895 in June 1993. The change from June 1992 to June 1993
is 102.6284%, which when multiplied by $10.96, the unrounded minimum benefit in Fiscal Year 1993, results in a new
unrounded minimum benefit of $11.25. Rounded to the nearest $5, the minimum benefit for Fiscal Year 1994 is $10.

Deductions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Food stamp benefits are calculated on the basis of an individual household's net income. Deductions serve to lower
household net income and thus to increase household benefits. When a household's net income decreases, its food stamp
benefits increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard deduction is available to all households. The excess shelter expense deduction is available to households
with extremely high shelter costs. There is a maximum amount for the excess shelter deduction for households with
no elderly or disabled members but no maximum for households with elderly or disabled members. The standard deduction
and the maximum amount for the excess shelter expense deduction for households with no elderly or disabled members
are being adjusted by this Notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Notice is also adjusting the homeless household shelter expense. The homeless household shelter expense is
a standard estimate of the shelter expenses of homeless households and is available to households in which all members
are homeless and are not receiving free shelter throughout the month.

Section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, provides that, in computing household income, households shall
be allowed a standard deduction. (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2014(e)). Section 5(e) also requires that the standard deduction
be adjusted periodically. The deduction for the 48 States and DC was last adjusted effective October 1, 1992. Section
5(e)(4) requires that the adjustment in the level of the standard deduction shall take into account changes in the
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI&hyph;U) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for items
other than food (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2014(e)(4)). The adjustments are rounded to the nearest lower dollar pursuant to the
requirements of Section 5(e). There are separate standard deductions for the 48 States and DC, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam,
and the Virgin Islands.

Section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act also provides that, in computing household income, households shall be allowed
a deduction for certain excess shelter expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 U.S.C. Sec. 2014(e). There is a maximum amount for the excess shelter expense deduction, unless the household has
an elderly or disabled member, in which case there is no maximum. The maximum amount for the excess shelter expense
deduction is adjusted each October 1 based on changes in the shelter, fuel and utilities components of housing costs
in the&blank; CPI&hyph;U published by BLS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, Section 13912 of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act amends 5(e) by raising the excess shelter
expense deduction cap over a period of three years before removing it altogether. The first increase is effective
July 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shelter deductions for the 48 States and DC are at one level while shelter deductions for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and
the Virgin Islands are set separately.

Section 11(e)(3)(E) of the Food Stamp Act requires the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prescribe rules requiring state agencies to develop standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates of the shelter expenses that may reasonably be expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be incurred by households in which all members are homeless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but which are not receiving free shelter throughout the month. 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. Sec. 2020(e)(3)(E). In recognition of the difficulty

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to document
the analysis of the effects of alternatives for management of white fir timber stands infested with fir engraver beetles
(Scolytus Ventralis) within the Nebo Management Area of the Spanish Fork Ranger District of the Uinta National Forest.
The proposed action is to implement management activities that will support the desired future condition for the
Nebo Management Areas outlined in the Uinta National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) in accordance
with the requirements of 36 CFR 219.17 and 219.27.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project area is located south of Payson, Utah, and northeast of Nephi, Utah, on lands accessible from the Mt. Nebo
Loop Scenic Byway. The largest concentration of infected timber stands are in the Sheepherder Hill area (Sections
15, 22&hyph;24, 28, 29, T10S, R2E, Salt Lake Meridian). The purpose of this proposed management action is to save the
remaining healthy trees by removing the competition that may be posed by dead and dying conifer trees and planting
seedlings to accelerate the recovery time for reestablishing a healthy forest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of activities to restore a healthy forest condition may require entry into areas designated as roadless
in the 1980 RARE II inventory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency invites comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis. In addition, the agency gives notice of the
full environmental analysis and decisionmaking process that will occur on the proposal so that interested and affected
people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Because much of this project area is within view of a designated Scenic Byway and in the vicinity of the Mt. Nebo Wilderness
Area, the nature and scope of the decision to be made is affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Aerial surveys indicate more than 15,000 acres of timber stands were infested in the Nebo Management Area by the summer
of 1993. A biological evaluation of current stand conditions was conducted on 350 acres to assess the magnitude of
the problem and potential management options. The biological evaluation indicated that management actions should
be considered to reduce the volume of dead and dying trees in the more concentrated, infested timber stands in the area,
specifically Sheepherder Hill. In the spring of 1993, an emergency timber sale, the Payson Canyon Salvage Sale, was
approved for harvesting approximately 141 acres of highly visible dead and dying timber within the proposed project
area, but not within an inventoried roadless area. The emergency sale is adjacent to the Sheepherder Hill area. Since
the Payson Canyon Salvage Sale was initiated, many additional fir beetle infestations have been identified and concern
about forest health has increased throughout the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scoping of public issues were initiated as part of the Payson Canyon Salvage Sale, which is applicable to this project.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are no known permits or licenses required to implement any of the proposed alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency's notice of availability appears in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is very important that those interested in the proposed action participate at that time. To be most helpful, comments
on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement
or the merits of the alternatives discussed (see The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing
the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of Draft Environmental Impact Statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewers' position and contentions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
State fish and wildlife agencies have the primary responsibility for protection and management of wildlife populations
on National Forest System lands, including adoption of State fish and wildlife laws and regulations affecting the
taking of resident game animals. The Forest Service enters into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each State
which governs Forest Service/State cooperation on matters of Statewide fish and wildlife policy or procedure affecting
the National Forest System. See FSM 2611.1. The States issue regulations regarding hunting licenses, methods, seasons,
locations, and bag limits for resident game and have the primary responsibility for enforcement of fish and wildlife
laws and regulations on National Forest System lands. Federal land management statutes acknowledge the States'
traditional role in managing fish and wildlife;

U.S.C. 528, the Sikes Act at 16 U.S.C. 670h, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, at 43 U.S.C. 1732. The Forest
Service therefore is generally reluctant to override State fish and wildlife regulation, except where federal interests,
such as protection of forest land, resources, and users require federal intervention.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The practice of placing bait (food or scent to attract wildlife) is a hunting activity allowed by some State laws and
regulations. The baiting of bears is particularly controversial. While the total number of States allowing bear
baiting has declined, State fish and wildlife agencies permit the baiting of black bear as a hunting activity in Alaska,
Idaho, Oregon, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The Forest
Service intends to work diligently through its ongoing cooperative efforts to encourage the States to evaluate their
regulation of the practice of baiting bears. In the meantime, the agency is issuing interim policy regarding the use
of bait on National Forest System lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, some national forests have regulated the placement of bear baits by requiring hunters and commercial
guides to obtain special use authorizations in order to prevent conflicts with other users or other problems associated
with the location and removal of bait. Additionally, some Forest Service Regions have issued orders under 36 CFR Part
261 to control litter, as well as to close certain areas to bear baiting where the practice would create unacceptable
adverse effects on other resources or forest users. In early 1992, the Forest Service's role in the regulation of bear
baiting on the national forests in Wyoming became an issue. Special use authorizations for bear baiting had been issued
on a number of national forests in that State. Typically, those special use authorizations included conditions with
which the holder had to comply to minimize adverse effects created by placement of bear bait.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1992, the Regional Foresters for the Rocky Mountain and Intermountain Regions issued a joint closure order
prohibiting bear baiting in the national forests in Wyoming, unless the baiting activity was conducted in compliance
with the requirements of the order pertaining to the placement and disposal of baits. Like the conditions that previously
had been included in special use authorizations, the requirements of the order were intended too minimize adverse
effects on forest resources and users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Fund for Animals and the Friends of the Bow brought suit to challenge the Forest Service's closure order and to challenge
what Plaintiffs considered a shift in established policy, that is, no longer requiring special use authorizations
for bear bait placement and using closure orders instead (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (D.D.C. Civ. No. 92&hyph;1694&hyph;TPJ)). These groups perceived this shift in method as a diminution in the level
of Forest Service regulation and wildlife protection. The parties settled the case upon the Forest Service's decision
to rescind the closure order and, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, to analyze the effects
of eliminating the practice of issuing special use authorizations for the placement of bear bait on National Forest
System lands in Wyoming. The Regions then prepared an Environmental Assessment to disclose effects on the proposed
action and alternatives to the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon completion of the Environmental Assessment and issuance of a Decision Notice by the Rocky Mountain and Intermountain
Regional Foresters in April 1993, there were new challenges to the agency's position. Subsequently, the Deputy Chief
for the National Forest System decided that national direction was needed to end the conflict and controversy. Accordingly,
the Decision Notice was rescinded, and bear baiting in national forests in Wyoming was prohibited pending issuance
of national direction. However, because the spring hunting season will begin before a final policy can be adopted,
the agency has determined that in fairness to outfitters, guides, and individual hunters, an interim policy should
be issued to ensure consistency and uniformity of policy and practice by the Forest Service. State agency regulations
have been developed and published in Wyoming and other States governing the use of bait in spring hunts for 1994. These
new Wyoming regulations were developed in close coordination with the Forest Service to be in concert with federal
regulation and law on the national forests involved and to be protective of National Forest System resources. In addition,
hunters, outfitters, and guides in Wyoming have moved forward with the normal practice of planning and booking hunting
activity based on the expectation that the Forest Service would have a final policy in place for the spring hunting
season. It is unfair to continue the bear baiting prohibition in Wyoming when such a prohibition is not in effect on
other National Forest System lands in other States where the practice is permitted, because of the agency's delay
in adopting a final policy. Therefore, the agency has issued an interim directive to Forest Service Manual Chapter
2640, which is set out at the end of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service special use authorization regulations at 36 CFR 251.50 exempt noncommercial use and occupancy,
including ``hunting,'' from the special use authorization requirement. Since hunting methods subject to State
regulation are included within the term ``hunting,'' the interim directive makes explicit that where State regulations
permit baiting, the Forest Service will not require a special use authorization for the practice of baiting connected
with hunting on National Forest System lands. Outfitter and guide activities require a special use authorization.
Outfitters and guides must comply with applicable State laws and regulations, and Forest Service closure orders
as a condition of special use authorizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if the placement of bait should become a land or resource management issue and it is determined that the State
regulations governing baiting would not protect resources in an area adequately or would otherwise be inconsistent
with the applicable forest plan or conflict with federal laws such as the Endangered Species Act, then the authorized
officer will issue an order to close the area to baiting. The authorized officer also may close an area to baiting considering
the likely impact on a site-specific basis on water quality, public health and sanitation, or the potential threat
to the viability of wildlife. Finally, the policy would explicitly prohibit the issuance of a special use authorization
to individuals for the specific act of placing bait on National Forest System lands for hunting purposes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The approach adopted in the interim policy maintains protection of national forest resources. First, under the terms
of the Memorandums of Understanding with the State fish and wildlife or game agencies, the Forest Service continuously
participates in the review and adoption of State game regulations as they affect National Forest System land or resources.
Second, the interim policy provides the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor with the flexibility and discretion
to determine if baiting should be prohibited in a specific location. Finally, if a hunter, in placing bait to attract
resident game creates litter through improper placement or untimely removal of bait in violation of State regulations
or Forest Service closure orders, the agency has the authority under its regulations at 36 CFR 261.11 to cite the hunter
for violating the prohibition on litter. If such bait results in violation of State regulations, the agency has authority
to cite the hunter for violation of 36 CFR 261.8, and agency employees routinely do so where such violations occur.
In short, the agency's approach (1) relies on existing relationships with each State, (2) prevents duplicative regulation
by Federal and State agencies, and (3) provides site-specific environmental safeguards to address those situations
where baiting would have an adverse site-specific effect on National Forest System land or resources.

Section 31.1b(2) of Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (57 FR 43180, September 18, 1992) excludes from documentation
in an environmental assessment or impact statement ``rules, regulations, or policies to establish Servicewide
administrative procedures, program processes, or instructions.'' This interim directive would provide administrative
instructions to Forest Service field offices on the procedures and processes to follow in the case of baiting resident
game. Accordingly, the agency's preliminary assessment is that this policy falls within this category of actions
and that no extraordinary circumstances exist which would require preparation of an environmental assessment or
environmental impact statement. A final determination will be made upon adoption of the final policy.

Use of Bait for Resident Game Hunting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of bait as a lure or attractant for the purpose of taking resident game on National Forest System lands is considered
a hunting practice subject to State regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where State hunting regulations prohibit the use of bait, the practice is prohibited on National Forest System lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where States permit the use of bait for attracting resident game, this activity is allowed on National Forest System
lands, subject to State hunting laws and regulations, unless the authorized officer determines on a site-specific
basis that there is a need to prohibit or restrict the practice of baiting because one or more of the following circumstances
exist:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The State laws and regulations on placement of bait are inadequate to protect forest land or other resources or users
in a particular location and/or to prevent trespass or litter;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Baiting is inconsistent with the applicable forest plan; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The State law and regulations conflict with Federal law, such as the Endangered Species Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the mandatory causes for prohibiting or restricting baiting, the authorized officer also may prohibit
baiting, regardless of the adequacy of State regulations, based on consideration of the likely impact of baiting
on such matters as water quality, public health and sanitation, the potential for litter, or the potential to threaten
the viability of wildlife.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the authorized officer determines that baiting is a significant problem and should be restricted or prohibited:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The officer shall notify State fish and wildlife officials and provide them the opportunity to resolve the issue
through further restrictions or the prohibition through State regulation rather than for the Forest Service to issue
the restriction or prohibition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the State does not revise its regulations to adequately regulate or restrict baiting, the Forest Service authorized
officer shall, time permitting, close the area or otherwise restrict baiting by issuing an order pursuant to 36 CFR
part 261.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where time does not permit closure of an area to baiting because the hunting season is underway and it would be impracticable
to issue a closure order, the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor shall take such mitigation and/or enforcement
measures as are appropriate and practicable to ensure consistency with forest plan management direction and compliance
with Federal laws, orders, and regulations, and protection of forest users and resources. For example, the agency
may close a road or gate, or cite violations of other State or Forest Service regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Closure is not the only way to address the practice of baiting. It is expected that land managers as part of their day-to-day
management of National Forest System lands and resources will be cognizant of the effects of hunting activities and
take such proactive measures, after consultation with the responsible fish and wildlife agency, such as hunter education,
as may be necessary to ensure resource protection consistent with forest plan management direction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This policy, in and of itself, does not compel an authorized officer to undertake a specific decision or to make a determination
of whether baiting is allowed in those States where the practice is permitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special use authorization shall not be issued for placing bait on National Forest System lands for hunting purposes
(36 CFR 251.50(c)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this section and to assure consistency in coordination of national forest wildlife matters with
State agencies, the authorized officer is the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor responsible for executing
memorandums of understanding with the State wildlife agency.

Scope of the Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise subject to this antidumping duty order is ferrosilicon (FeSi), a ferroalloy generally containing,
by weight, not less than four percent iron, more than eight percent but not more than 96 percent silicon, not more than
10 percent chromium, not more than 30 percent manganese, not more than three percent phosphorous, less than 2.75 percent
magnesium, and not more than 10 percent calcium of any other element. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FeSi is a ferroalloy produced by combining silicon and iron through smelting in a submerged-arc furnace. FeSi is used
primarily as an alloying agent in the production of steel and cast iron. It is also used in the steel industry as a deoxidizer
and a reducing agent, and by cast iron producers as an inoculant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FeSi is differentiated by size and by grade. The sizes express the maximum and minimum dimensions of the lumps of FeSi
found in a given shipment. FeSi grades are defined by the percentages by weight of contained silicon and other minor
elements. FeSi is most commonly sold to the iron and steel industries in standard grades of 75 percent and 50 percent
FeSi. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calcium silicon, ferrocalcium silicon, and magnesium FeSi are specifically excluded from the scope of this order.
Calcium silicon is an alloy containing, by weight, not more than five percent iron, 60 to 65 percent silicon, and 28
to 32 percent calcium. Ferrocalcium silicon is a ferroalloy containing, by weight, not less than four percent iron,
60 to 65 percent silicon, and more than 10 percent calcium. Magnesium FeSi is a ferroalloy containing, by weight, not
less than four percent iron, not more than 55 percent silicon, and not less than 2.75 percent magnesium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FeSi is currently classifiable under the following subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS): 7202.21.1000, 7202.21.5000, 7202.21.7500, 7202.21.9000, 7202.29.0010, and 7202.29.0050. Although
the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of
this order is dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FeSi in the form of slag is included within the scope of this order if it meets, generally, the chemical content definition
stated above and is capable of being used as FeSi. FeSi is used primarily as an alloying agent in the production of steel
and cast iron. It is also used in the steel industry as a deoxidizer and a reducing agent, and by cast iron producers as
an inoculant. Parties that believe their importations of slag do not meet these definitions should contact the Department
and request a scope determination.

Antidumping Duty Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 24, 1994, in accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified
the Department that imports of FeSi from Brazil materially injure a U.S. industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 735(e) of the Act, on February 15, 1994, the Department issued an amended final determination
that FeSi from Brazil is being sold at less than fair value (59 FR 8598, February 23, 1994) to correct ministerial errors.
On February 18, 1994, the ITC, after considering the Department's amended final determination, reaffirmed its determination
that the domestic industry producing FeSi is materially injured by reason of subject imports from Brazil, including
imports from Minasligas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with section 736 of the Act, the Department will direct Customs officers to assess, upon
further advice by the administering authority pursuant to section 736(a)(1) of the Act, antidumping duties equal
to the amount by which the foreign market value (FMV) of the merchandise exceeds the United States price (USP) for all
entries of FeSi from Brazil. These antidumping duties will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of FeSi from Brazil
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 16, 1993, the date on which the Department
published its preliminary determination notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 43323). On or after the date of publication of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Customs officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties, the following
cash deposits for the subject merchandise.

In its final determination, the Department found that critical circumstances existed with respect to exports from
Brazil by Italmagnesio S.A. Industria e Comercio (Italmagnesio). However, on January 24, 1994, the ITC notified
the Department that retroactive assessment of antidumping duties was not necessary to prevent recurrence of material
injury from massive imports over a short period. As a result of the ITC's negative critical circumstances determination,
pursuant to section 735(b)(4) of the Act, we shall order Customs to terminate the retroactive suspension of liquidation
and to release any bond or other security and refund any cash deposit required under section 733(e)(2) with respect
to Italmagnesio's FeSi entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption prior to August 16, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the Act. Interested parties may contact the Central Records Unit, Room B&hyph;099 of the Main Commerce Building,
for copies of an updated list of antidumping duty orders currently in effect.

Note: Temporary Restraining Order Regarding Ferrosilicon Imports from Companhia Brasileira Carbureto de Calcio
(CBCC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 23, 1994, the Court of International Trade (CIT) entered a temporary restraining order prohibiting the
Customs Service from collecting deposits of the estimated antidumping duty margin for CBCC at a rate higher than that
published in the original final determination. Thus, notwithstanding the language of the antidumping duty order
(above), the Department will not, until permitted to do so by the CIT, instruct Customs to collect cash deposits equal
to the amount of the antidumping duty margin calculated in the Department's amended final determination for imports
of ferrosilicon from CBCC. Until we are notified differently by the Court, we are instructing Customs to collect cash
deposits on imports of ferrosilicon from CBCC equal to 2.23 percent, the amount of the antidumping duty margin calculated
in the Department's final original determination.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to a request by Yamaji Fishing Net Co., Ltd. (the respondent), the Department of Commerce (the Department)
has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping finding on fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan. This
review covers one company and the period June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993. For these preliminary results, we applied
the best information available (BIA). The review indicates the existence of dumping margins during the period.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 6, 1972, the Department of Treasury published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (37 FR 11560) the antidumping finding on fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan. On June 7, 1993, the Department
published a notice of opportunity to request review for the period June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993 (58 FR 31941). The
respondent requested, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a) that we conduct an administrative review. We published
the notice of initiation on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39007). The Department has now conducted that administrative review
in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by the review are shipments of fishnetting of man-made fibers, not including salmon gill netting,
from Japan. The merchandise is currently classified under item numbers 5608.11.00, 5608.19.10, and 5608.90.10
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes.
The written product description remains dispositive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This review covers entries of the subject merchandise by Yamaji Fishing Net Co., Ltd., during the period June 1, 1992
through May 31, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although Yamaji attempted to respond to all Department requests for information, the data submitted was unverifiable.
In particular, at verification in Japan we discovered that approximately 40 percent of total home market sales had
not been reported. Furthermore, because Yamaji did not prepare adequate source documentation, the Department was
unable to complete sales traces to its satisfaction. Finally, significant discrepancies and errors in Yamaji's
sales listings were identified, thereby making it impossible to verify several of Yamaji's claimed adjustments.
For further information on the deficiencies in the respondent's questionnaire response, see the verification report
filed on the record of this case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because we have no data upon which we can reliably base our analysis, the Department must use BIA for its preliminary
results of review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Best Information Available
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, we rely upon BIA in cases where a party refuses or is unable to produce
information requested in a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes proceedings.
The Department generally uses a two-tiered approach in its choice of BIA. For uncooperative respondents or respondents
which substantially impede the proceedings (``first tier''), the Department uses the higher of (1) the highest rate
for any company from the original investigation or prior administrative review or (2) the highest rate found in the
current review for any company. For respondents which attempt to cooperate (``second tier''), the Department uses
the higher of (1) the highest rate ever applicable to the firm for the subject merchandise or (2) the highest calculated
rate in the current review for any firm (see Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts
Thereof from France, et al., 58 FR 39729, July 26, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As outlined above, the second-tier BIA rate should be applied, since Yamaji was essentially cooperative. Accordingly,
we will continue to apply Yamaji's previous rate of 18.30 percent, which is both the highest rate ever applicable to
the firm for the subject merchandise and the highest rate in the proceeding (see Fishnetting of Man-Made Fibers from
Japan; Final Results of Administrative Review of Antidumping Finding, 56 FR 49457, September 30, 1991).

Preliminary Results of the Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that a margin exists for the period June 1, 1992 through May 31,

Interested parties may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice and may request a
hearing within 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication
or the first business day thereafter. Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted
no later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to
issues raised in those comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication of this notice. The
Department will publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results of its analysis of
issues raised in any such written comments or at a hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective, upon publication of the notice of final results
of this administrative review, for all shipments of the subject merchandise from Japan that are entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of review, as provided by section
751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be that established in the final
results of this administrative review; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above,
the cash deposit rate will continue to be their company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if
the exporter is not a firm covered in this review or the original investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit
rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) if neither
the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review, and, because the proceeding is governed
by an antidumping finding, the cash deposit rate will be set equal to the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first
administrative review, as discussed below.

United States, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation (or that rate
as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping
duty orders. In proceedings governed by antidumping findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others''
rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new
shipper'' rate established in the first final results of the administrative review published by the Department (or
that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for the
purpose of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping finding, and we are unable to ascertain the ``all others'' rate
from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of the review will be 1.94 percent,
the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final results of the administrative review published by the Department
(47 FR 28978, July 2, 1982).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 14, 1994, we received petitions filed in proper form by the Floral Trade Council. In accordance with 19
CFR 353.12, the petitioner alleges that imports of fresh cut roses from Colombia and Ecuador are being, or are likely
to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as
amended (the Act), and that these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner has stated that it has standing to file the petitions because it is an interested party, as defined under
section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petitions were filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product
subject to these investigations. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section
771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, these petitions, it should file a written notification
with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by these investigations are fresh cut roses, including sweethearts or miniatures, intermediates,
and hybrid teas, whether imported as individual blooms (stems) or in bouquets or bunches. Roses are classifiable
under subheadings 0603.10.6010 and 0603.10.6090 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).
The HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes. Our written description of the scope of
these investigations is dispositive.

Petitioner based United States price (USP) on offers for sale by Colombian importers and distributors of the subject
merchandise to U.S. customers. Petitioner deducted from USP amounts for air freight, insurance, customs duties
and handling charges. Petitioner also deducted an amount for commissions paid to the grower on sales of subject merchandise.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner calculated foreign market value (FMV) using two methodologies. First, petitioner based FMV on import
statistics for fresh cut roses in various third countries. Second, petitioner based FMV on constructed value (CV).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For FMV based on import statistics, petitioner used third country import statistics obtained from Statistics Canada
and Eurostat. Petitioner deducted amounts for air freight and insurance and, where appropriate, duty charges. Since
the import statistics were in foreign currencies, petitioner made currency conversions using monthly exchange
rates published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner alleged home market sales below the cost of production (COP) with respect to the subject merchandise for
all Colombian producers and exporters named in the petition. However, petitioner did not provide any company-specific
sales data in its COP allegation. Because it is the Department's practice to require COP allegations to be company-specific,
we have not initiated a COP investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding FMV based on CV, because the Department is not initiating a COP investigation, and because the information
submitted concerning price-to-price comparisons was deemed to be adequate, we did not review the CV data contained
in the petition, nor have we accepted it for purposes of initiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comparison of FMV based on import statistics and net USP for sales of fresh cut roses from Colombia results in a range
of alleged dumping margins from .4 percent to 256.7 percent.

Petitioner based USP on offers for sale by Ecuadorean importers and distributors of the subject merchandise to U.S.
customers. Petitioner deducted from USP amounts for air freight, insurance, customs duties and handling charges.

calculated FMV using the two methodologies discussed above for Colombia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner alleged home market sales below COP with respect to the subject merchandise for all Ecuadorean producers
and exporters named in the petition. However, because petitioner did not provide any company-specific sales data

Initiation of Investigations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 19 CFR 353.13(a), the Department must determine, within 20 days after a petition is filed, whether the petition
properly alleges the basis on which an antidumping duty may be imposed under section 731 of the Act, and whether the
petition contains information reasonably available to the petitioners supporting the allegations. We have examined
the petitions on fresh cut roses from Colombia and Ecuador and have found that the petitions meet the requirements
of 19 CFR 353.13(a). Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations to determine whether imports
of fresh cut roses from Colombia and Ecuador are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair
value. If these investigations proceed normally, we will make our preliminary determinations by July 25, 1994.

The ITC will determine by March 31, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of fresh cut roses from
Colombia and Ecuador are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. A negative ITC determination
in any of these investigations will result in its termination; otherwise, the investigations will proceed according
to statutory and regulatory time limits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 14, 1994, we received petitions filed in proper form by the Connecticut Steel Corp., Georgetown Steel
Corp., Keystone Steel &amp; Wire Co., North Star Steel Texas, Inc., Co-Raritan River Steel Co., and Northwestern
Steel &amp; Wire Co. (petitioners). At the request of the Department of Commerce (the Department), petitioners filed
a supplement to the petitions to correct methodological errors and support the data presented. In accordance with
19 CFR 353.12, petitioners allege that imports of steel wire rod (SWR) from Belgium and Germany are being, or are likely
to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as
amended (the Act), and that these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners have stated that they have standing to file the petitions because they are interested parties, as defined
under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petitions are filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the
product subject to these investigations. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or
(F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, these petitions, it should file
a written notification with the Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Department's regulations, any producer or reseller seeking exclusion from a potential antidumping duty
order must submit its request for exclusion within 30 days of the date of the publication of this notice. The procedures
and requirements are contained in 19 CFR 353.14.

Allegations of Sales Below Cost of Production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners allege that Forges de Thy-Marcinelle, a potential respondent in the Belgium investigation, is selling
the subject merchandise in the home market at prices below its COP. This allegation is based on a comparison of company-specific
home market prices with the COP. COP was based on the costs of a comparable U.S. producer adjusted for known differences
in the country of production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information presented, we have reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that the home market sales of
Forges de Thy-Marcinelle are being made at less than COP. See Memorandum to Marie E. Parker from C.M. Miller dated March
4, 1994, which is on file in the Import Administration Central Records Unit. Accordingly, pursuant to section 773(b)
of the Act and 19 CFR 353.51, we will initiate a COP investigation with respect to this company if it is named as a respondent
in the investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners also allege that specific potential respondents in the German investigation are selling the subject
merchandise in the home market at prices below their COP. These allegations are based on a comparison of company-specific
home market prices with the COP. COP was based on the costs of a comparable U.S. producer adjusted for known differences
in the country of production, and/or company-specific information, and on the company's financial statements,
when applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information presented, we have reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that the home market sales of
the following German producers are being made at less than COP: Stahl-und Walzwerk Brandenburg GmbH, Saarstahl AG,
and Thyssen Stahl AG. See Memorandum to Marie E. Parker from C.M. Miller dated March 4, 1994, which is on file in the Import
Administration Central Records Unit. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 773(b) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.51, we will
initiate COP investigations with respect to each of these companies if they are named as a respondent in the investigation.

We have examined the petitions for SWR from Belgium and Germany, as amended, and have found that the petitions meet
the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations to determine
whether imports of SWR from Belgium and Germany are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than
fair value. If these investigations proceed normally, we will make our preliminary determinations by July 25, 1994.

The Petition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 14, 1994, we received a petition from by Connecticut Steel Corp., Georgetown Steel Corp., North Star Steel
Texas, Inc., Co-Steel Raritan Co., Keystone Consolidated Industries and Northwestern Steel &amp; Wire Co. (``Petitioners'')
on behalf of the United States steel wire rod industry. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.12, petitioners allege that manufacturers,
producers, or exporters of steel wire rod in Germany receive subsidies within the meaning of section 701 of the Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Injury Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because Germany is a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, title VII of the
Act applies to this investigation. Accordingly, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) must determine whether
imports of the subject merchandise from Germany are materially injuring, or threatening material injury to, a U.S.
industry.

Petitioners have stated that they are interested parties, as defined in section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and that they
have filed the petition on behalf of the U.S. industry producing steel wire rod. If any interested party, as described
under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to,
this petition, such party should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration,
in accordance with 19 CFR 355.31.

Initiation of Investigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has examined the petition on steel wire rod from Germany and found that it complies with the requirements
of section 702(b) of the Act. Therefore, in accordance with section 702 of the Act, we are initiating a countervailing
duty investigation to determine whether manufacturers, producers or exporters of steel wire rod receive countervailable
subsidies. The following programs are included in our investigation.

We are not including the following program which was alleged to be benefiting producers of the subject merchandise
in Germany.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Government of Saarland's Capital Contribution to DHS of DM 145.1 Million
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners alleged that a DM 145.1 million payment by the Government of Saarland (GOS) constitutes a countervailable
equity infusion. Petitioners base this allegation on their claim that the shares which the GOS received in exchange
for this payment had a value of only DM 82.5 million, DM 62.5 million less than what the GOS paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The question of whether this transaction constitutes a countervailable equity infusion was addressed in Certain
Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products From Germany (58 FR 6233, January 27, 1993). The Department determined
that the funds were provided on terms consistent with commercial considerations because at the same time that the
GOS invested, two private investors also invested in DHS on the same terms. Petitioners have provided no new information
in this petition indicating that this determination was incorrect. Therefore, the Department does not intend to
re-investigate whether the investment was consistent with commercial considerations.

The ITC will determine by March 31, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that a United States industry is
being materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of steel wire rod imports from Germany. If
the ITC makes a negative determination, we will terminate this proceeding; otherwise, the investigation will proceed
according to statutory and regulatory time limits.

 NOAA is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361&hyph;1407),
the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C 1531&hyph;1543) and the Whaling Convention Act 16 U.S.C. 916&hyph;916l). In
addition, it provides staff support to the U.S. Commissioner to the IWC and to the IWC Interagency Committee. Consistent
with these responsibilities, NOAA develops positions for implementation of the aboriginal/subsistence harvest
of bowhead whales under Paragraph 13 of the Schedule to the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling,
December 2, 1946, 62 Stat. 1716, T.I.A.S. No. 1849 (entered into force, November 10, 1948).

In order to provide for review and comment by the public of the data upon which the U.S. positions are based, the following
information is provided: (1) The IWC catch level available for the U.S. aboriginal/subsistence bowhead whale harvest
for 1992&hyph;1994; (2) a summary of available bowhead scientific information, including estimates of current
population level and annual recruitment rates; (3) a summary of information on the nature and extent of aboriginal/subsistence
need; (4) the level of aboriginal/subsistence harvest limits which could be implemented domestically; and (5) notice
of the availability of those documents reviewed by NOAA and relied on by the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere
in making his finding on the range of harvest limits. NOAA is soliciting public comment on the proposed domestic implementation
of the IWC bowhead whale catch limit for 1994.

``The taking of bowhead whales from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock by aborigines is permitted, but only
when the meat and products of such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines and further
provided that: For each of the years 1992, 1993, and 1994 combined, the total number of whales struck shall not exceed
141, except that: (A) Any unused strikes up to ten percent of the total strikes allowed in the years 1989, 1990, and 1991
combined shall be carried forward from those years and added to the combined total of strikes for the years 1992, 1993,
and 1994; and (B) in any one year no more than 54 whales shall be struck and no more than 41 shall be landed. (Schedule to

At the 1991 IWC meeting, the Scientific Committee agreed that the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Sea population of bowhead
whales is between 6,400 and 9,200 animals, with a most likely estimate of 7,500 whales. A minimum estimate of the replacement
yield (RY) was calculated to be 92 whales per year, and the most likely replacement yield for the population size of
7,500 is 254 whales per year. The replacement yield defines the number of new whales annually joining the adult population,
and it is assumed that, all other things being constant, up to this number could be taken from the population without
causing it to decline.

The Department of the Interior (DOI) conducted its analysis of the nature and extent of aboriginal/subsistence need
for bowhead whales and whaling in 1983, and the IWC adopted this method for quantifying need in 1986. DOI contracted
for a new study on the quantification of subsistence and cultural need for bowhead whales in 1987, which was presented
at the 1988 meeting. The new study presented the cultural and subsistence need of nine Alaska Eskimo whaling villages
to take 41 landed bowhead whales. This quantification of need used the same method of calculation accepted by the IWC
in 1986. This method derives the mean annual number of bowhead whales landed per capita during a specified historical
period and multiplies this mean by the current Eskimo population of nine Alaska Eskimo whaling villages. The result
of this calculation is the total number of bowhead whales these Eskimo whaling villages need to land each year in order
to meet their cultural and subsistence need.

When the IWC adopted this method of quantifying need, members of the IWC Aboriginal Subsistence Subcommittee noted
that the quantification was based on a large but incomplete series of data on historical bowhead landings. It was also
noted that the quantification used an inconsistent data base period. The DOI study was initiated to correct these
deficiencies. To complete the series of data on historical bowhead whale landings to the extent possible, the study
undertook a comprehensive review of available published and unpublished sources of bowhead landings. Remaining
gaps are unlikely to be significantly reduced with further searches for historic data on bowhead landings. The data
resulting from this study also permitted the use of a consistent historical base period for the calculation of need.
In the prior analysis, the base periods varied from 1940 to 1970 and 1950 to 1970. The base period now begins in 1910,
the year following the cessation of commercial whaling in the Arctic, and ends in 1969, prior to the period of unusually
high bowhead harvests in the unique economic circumstances of the 1970s. Therefore, applying the additional landed
bowhead data and the longer period to the accepted method of quantifying need, results in a current cultural and subsistence
need of 41 landed whales.

4. Domestic Harvest Range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IWC management scheme for aboriginal/subsistence whaling provides (in Schedule paragraph 13(a)(2)): ``For
stocks below the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level but above a certain minimum level, aboriginal/subsistence
catches shall be permitted so long as they are set at levels which allow whale stocks to move to the MSY level.'' Given
the above-stated estimates of replacement yields of 92 (lower bound) to 254 whales for the point estimate recruited
into the population annually, an aboriginal/subsistence catch can be permitted in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The catch limit for bowhead whales for the years 1992&hyph;1994, established by the IWC, is 141 strikes plus 13 strikes
carried over from the previous block quota with no more than 54 whales struck and no more than 41 landed in any one year.
Of the 154 total strikes for 1992&hyph;1994, 50 bowhead whales were struck and 38 were landed in 1992, and 52 were struck
and 41 landed in 1993. Therefore, the number under consideration for allocation to the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission
for the 1994 catch limit is 52 strikes or 41 landed whales.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 4, 1994, the Department of Defense published a notice announcing the meeting of the Advisory Board on the Investigative
Capabilities of the Department of Defense (59 FR 10378). This notice is published to announce a change in the status
of the meeting. All sessions on March 17, 1994 will be open. Portions of the meeting on March 18, 1994 will be closed.
This determination is based upon the consideration that it is expected that the discussions will involve classified
matters of national security. Such classified material is so intertwined with the unclassified material that it
cannot reasonably be segregated into separate discussions without defeating the effectiveness and meaning of the
closed portion of the meeting. To permit all of this Advisory Board meeting to be open to the public would prevent discussion
of such matters and would greatly diminish the Board's findings or recommendations to the Secretary of Defense.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed project involves maintenance dredging of the Federal navigation channel in Indiana Harbor and Canal,
and construction and operation of a confined disposal facility (CDF) for containment of contaminated sediments
dredged from the harbor and canal. Approximately 4.7 million cubic yards of sediment could be dredged and confined
during a 30-year maintenance period (1998 to 2027). Alternatives include (but are not limited to) dredging/disposal,
no action, and innovative treatment technologies; alternative CDF locations include the ECI, J&hyph;Pit, and Inland
Steel sites. Major features of the recommended plan include dredging the authorized Federal navigation channel
and certain berthing areas/dockfaces adjacent to the channel, and construction of a CDF. The proposed CDF would be
constructed at the site of the former Energy Cooperative, Inc. (ECI). The ECI site is located along the north bank of
the Lake George Branch of the Indiana Harbor Canal, immediately west of Indianapolis Boulevard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE proposes to install a concrete box with 2 weirs (obstructions placed in a stream, diverting water for measuring
the rate of flow) and a raw water line to manage the flow of the EFPC. The action would take place at the headwaters of the
creek, which are located within the boundaries of the Y&hyph;12 Plant. The open box would be approximately 12 by 14
feet and emplaced at the edge of the creek bank to allow for proper diffusion and mixing of the added water with creek
headwaters. Additional water would be provided by extending the existing raw water line from the Clinch River. As
part of the proposed action, a Best Management Practices Plan will be prepared to identify the necessary steps to minimize
potential impacts to the creek. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The addition of Clinch River water to the creek is required by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
in order to guarantee a minimum base flow as the limitations established in the Y&hyph;12 Plant National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit are based on management of the flow in the EFPC. Additional water will not be added
when the flow in the creek is above this established minimum flow, such as during storm events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with DOE regulations, ``Compliance with Floodplains/Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements,''
10 CFR part 1022, DOE will prepare a Floodplain Assessment for this proposed DOE action. After DOE issues the assessment,
a Floodplain Statement of Findings will be published in the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Department of Energy is seeking expressions of interest for the Office of Environmental Management Technology
Leveraging Initiative. The Office of Environmental Management was established in November 1989 and was tasked with
cleaning up the legacy of environmental pollution at DOE weapons complex facilities, preventing further environmental
contamination, and instituting responsible environmental management. The magnitude and complexity of many aspects
of this mission are such that it cannot be achieved using existing technology without incurring high costs. The technology
leveraging initiative is to transfer into practice technologies developed by DOE in its national laboratories or
in other agreements. It will also be beneficial to the nation if the new or improved technologies developed to clean
up the DOE weapons complex facilities can be used by other government agencies and for other industrial cleanup applications.
Considering that DOE and the world market needs for environmental cleanup are immense, there is a large potential
market for technology transfer. Consequently, cost sharing will be a key consideration. It is anticipated that this
activity will be partially DOE funded at initiation, and will mature to self sufficiency with little or no Government
funding.

at the Y&hyph;12 Plant, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Y&hyph;12 Plant, which is part of the DOE-owned Oak Ridge Reservation,
located 20 miles west of Knoxville, Tennessee, has had a mission to store HEU since the World War II era. Since 1964,
HEU used in the production of nuclear weapons was recycled from HEU stockpiled at the Y&hyph;12 Plant. Because the
United States has now ceased production of nuclear weapons, DOE must hold its excess HEU in storage until a decision
on long-term disposition is made by an interagency task force recently formed by President Clinton. The Department
of Energy will also discuss its overall nuclear materials storage and disposition planning activities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this meeting is to provide the State of Tennessee and other stakeholders an opportunity to discuss the
EA and the Department's long-term plans for disposition of special nuclear materials. All interested and affected
individuals are invited to participate in the public meeting which will be held at the Pollard Auditorium, Oak Ridge
Associated Universities, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday, March 24, 1994. During the morning
and afternoon sessions (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) the Department proposes to discuss the EA and its nuclear materials disposition
activities. During the evening session (6 p.m. to 9 p.m.) the morning and afternoon sessions will be summarized and
the public will have further opportunity to ask questions and discuss the EA. Department of Energy officials from
Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Headquarters in Washington, DC, will be present at each of the sessions to answer questions.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a new license for the existing Pine Hydroelectric Project, located on the Pine River in Florence
County, Wisconsin, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's
staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that
approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement measures, would not constitute
a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on March 2, 1994, Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (``Algonquin''), 1284 Soldiers Field Road,
Boston, Massachusetts 02135, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;260&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(c)
of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing Algonquin to (i) transport
gas on a pipeline lateral for Canal Electric Company (``CEC'') and Montaup Electric Company (``MEC'') (CEC and MEC
are collectively referred to herein as ``Customer'') pursuant to a proposed new Rate Schedule X&hyph;40, and (ii)
to construct and operate facilities necessary to perform such service, all as more fully set forth in the application
which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Algonquin proposes to construct and operate facilities and transport on a firm basis up to 75,000 MMBtu per day of natural
gas through such facilities under a new Rate Schedule X&hyph;40 for Customer. Algonquin states that Customer intends
to use the natural gas transported hereunder as fuel for Unit No. 2 of the electric generating station in Sandwich,
Massachusetts. Specifically, Algonquin proposes to construct, own and operate a pipeline lateral, meter station,
and appurtenant facilities (the ``Canal Lateral''). Algonquin states that the Canal Lateral will extend from a point
on Algonquin's existing G&hyph;8 system in Bourne, Massachusetts along the north side of the Cape Cod Canal to an agreed
upon point of interconnection, at or near the Bourne/Sandwich town line, with facilities to be constructed by Customer
for purposes of receiving the gas. Algonquin states that Customer is filing a contemporaneous petition for declaratory
order requesting that the Commission declare its facilities to be nonjurisdictional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Algonquin states that transportation service under proposed Rate Schedule X&hyph;40 will consist of receipt of
gas at the head of the Canal Lateral and delivery to Customer's facilities at the terminus of the Canal Lateral. Algonquin
states that transportation service upstream of the Canal Lateral will be provided through existing facilities under
existing open access rate schedules, including firm transportation obtained through capacity release or interruptible
transportation. Customer and Algonquin have executed a precedent agreement contemplating firm transportation
service for a fourteen year term under proposed Rate Schedule X&hyph;40 and construction of the following facilities
necessary to provide that service: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 4.0 miles of 18-inch pipeline extending from the interconnection of Algonquin's existing G&hyph;8 and G&hyph;11
System in Bourne, Massachusetts along the north side of the Cape Cod Canal to an agreed upon point of interconnection
with facilities to be constructed by Customer at or near the Bourne/Sandwich, Massachusetts town line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Line pressure measurement meter station adjacent to the existing Algonquin Sagamore Meter Station, consisting
of measurement facilities with flow control capability, a remote terminal unit, and utilities for data transmission,
valves and other associated equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Expansion of the existing G&hyph;11 System tap valve site and construction of a new valve site at the upstream and
downstream ends of the Canal Lateral respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Algonquin states that the facilities would be constructed during the summer and fall of 1995 for an in-service date
of November 1, 1995. The cost of the facilities is estimated to be approximately $7.5 million. The proposed monthly
demand charge for service under Rate Schedule X&hyph;40 is $2.4986 per MMBtu.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AER states that it proposes to abandon 1,300 feet of 2-inch plastic pipe (AER's Line KM&hyph;9) and two 1-inch delivery
taps in Union County, Arkansas. Line KM&hyph;9 was constructed in 1923 and certificated in AER's Grandfather Docket
No. G&hyph;252, it is stated. AER says that Line KM&hyph;9 has been used to deliver gas to five ALG domestic customers
in a rural area. AER states that there are no industrial or prospective industrial customers on this line. It is further
stated that ALG would continue to secure the appropriate supply arrangements and provide deliveries to the rural
customers. Therefore, AER says that no services to the customers would be abandoned.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on March 1, 1994, Canal Electric Company, One Main Street Post Office Box 9150 Cambridge, Massachusetts
02142&hyph;9150, and Montaup Electric Company, One Liberty Square Post Office Box 2333 Boston, Massachusetts 02107,
(Jointly referred to as Petitioners) filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;264&hyph;000 a request for a declaratory order
that Petitioners construction and operation of certain facilities are not subject to the Commission's jurisdiction
under the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to
public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners state that they intend to construct and operate facilities designed to receive natural gas supplies
from a new lateral pipeline to be constructed by Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Algonquin) and to deliver those
gas supplies to Generating Unit No. 2 at the Canal Electric Plant located in Sandwich, Massachusetts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Petitioners proposes to construct, own, and operate approximately 4,600 feet of 18-inch pipeline.
Petitioners state that approximately 3,300 feet of this will be located on Canal Plant property and approximately
1,300 feet will extend from the Canal Plant property to the point of interconnection with new facilities to be constructed
by Algonquin. In addition, Petitioners state that they will construct appurtenant pressure regulating and heating
facilities. Petitioners state that their pipeline facilities would originate on the property of the existing Canal
Plant, proceed in a northwesterly direction, cross under the Cape Cod Canal, and terminate at a point located north
of the Cape Cod Canal, at or near the Bourne/Sandwich town line, where they would interconnect with the interstate
natural gas transmission facilities proposed for construction by Algonquin in Docket No. CP94&hyph;260&hyph;000.
Petitioners state that the facilities will be constructed for the purpose of receiving supplies of natural gas for
use only as fuel for Canal Unit No. 2, and will not be used to transport or sell natural gas to any third party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners request that the Commission rule: (1) That Petitioners will not become natural gas companies subject
to the jurisdiction of the Commission by virtue of their ownership and operation of pipeline facilities; (2) that
Petitioners proposed facilities will not be used in interstate commerce; and (3) the service to be provided by Petitioners
facilities will not occur in interstate commerce.

Take notice that on March 4, 1994, Arkla Energy Resources Company (``AER''), 1600 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002,
filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;267&hyph;000 an application pursuant to sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act
for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the replacement and rearrangement of existing
mainline pipeline, abandonment of minor storage and gas supply facilities and certain mainline enhancements to
its pipeline system in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AER specifically proposes to do the following replacement activities: (a) Reclaim Line F in Louisiana, 87 miles of
20-inch Dresser-coupled pipe and replace it with 91 miles of 20-inch welded steel pipe and rate the MAOP to 1000 psig
or greater; (b) re-route a portion of Line F in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana to connect to AER's Ruston Storage Field
and abandon in place Line 1&hyph;F and Line FT&hyph;5; (c) reclassify approximately 8.2 miles of Line F in Caddo Parish,
Louisiana and operate it as a low pressure gas supply line; and (d) abandon 55 inactive delivery taps and rearrange
eleven existing delivery taps, all serving Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company. AER states that these replacement activities
are estimated to cost $48.6 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AER also specifically proposes to do the following mainline enhancements: (a) Install a mainline compressor station,
two 2,250 h.p. compressor units, on Line F near the Ruston Storage Field and rearrange the existing Ruston Storage
Compressor unit to perform both mainline and storage operations; (b) install approximately 2.2 miles of 20-inch
pipeline (Line ACT&hyph;4) at the discharge side of AER's Malvern Compressor Station on Line AC to Line S&hyph;3&hyph;S
in Hot Spring County, Arkansas; and (c) uprate the MAOP on AER's Line S from 880 psig to 930 and abandon 2,208 feet of Line
S in Harrison County, Texas. AER states that these mainline enhancements are estimated to cost $12.4 million.

finds that a grant of the certificate and/or permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by
the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its
own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.

and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 183(g) of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires the Administrator to conduct a study of whether
the methodology in use by the EPA, as of the date of enactment, for establishing a design value for ozone, provides a
reasonable indicator of the ozone air quality of ozone nonattainment areas. The EPA is directed to obtain public review
of the study report prior to submitting the report to Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The focus of the Ozone Design Value Study is EPA's ozone design value methodology. A design value may be viewed intuitively
as a concentration value used to quantify the degree to which the level of an air quality standard has been exceeded.
With the wording of the ozone standard, the appropriate design value is the concentration with expected number of
exceedances equal to 1. These ozone design values were used to classify areas as marginal, moderate, serious, severe,
or extreme in accordance with the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This notice announces the availability of a draft report of the Clean Air Act Ozone Design Value Study for public review

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated March 3, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the authority
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of Alabama, resulting from severe winter storms, freezing,
and flooding on January 16&hyph;February 14, 1994, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster
declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I,
therefore, declare that such a major disaster exists in the State of Alabama.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes,
such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You are authorized to provide Public Assistance in the designated areas. Consistent with the requirement that Federal
assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited
to 75 percent of the total eligible costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The time period prescribed for the implementation of section 310(a), Priority to Certain Applications for Public
Facility and Public Housing Assistance, 42 U.S.C. 5153, shall be for a period not to exceed six months after the date
of this declaration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the authority vested in the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
under Executive Order 12148, I hereby appoint J. Rolando Sarabia of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act
as the Federal Coordinating Officer for this declared disaster.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I do hereby determine the following areas of the State of Alabama to have been affected adversely by this declared major

<DOCTITLE>Shawmut National Corporation, Hartford, Connecticut, and Boston, Massachusetts; Petition for Reconsideration
of the Board's decision</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Shawmut National Corporation, Hartford, Connecticut, and Boston, Massachusetts (Shawmut), has filed a Petition
for Reconsideration of the Board's decision dated November 15, 1993, not to approve its application to acquire New
Dartmouth Bank, Manchester, New Hampshire. The Board's Rules of Procedure provide that a request for reconsideration
of a Board decision must present relevant facts that for good cause shown were not previously presented to the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shawmut represents in its request that relevant facts not previously considered by the Board are now available. In
particular, Shawmut refers to its settlement with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission of charges
of illegal discrimination by Shawmut Mortgage Company; its improved lending record as reflected by 1993 data filed
under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA); the results of its efforts to ensure that HMDA data are accurate; managerial
and organizational changes designed to strengthen compliance; and the results of steps initiated to improve its
lending to minority and low- and moderate-income communities. In light of these facts, Shawmut maintains that the
Board should grant the petition and approve the proposed acquisition. Notice of the filing of the petition is published
in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the petition. The Board expects to act on
the petition no later than May 2, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments may be mailed to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington,
DC 20551. Comments addressed to Mr. Wiles may also be delivered to the Board's mail room between 8:45 a.m. and 5:15 p.m.,
and to the security control room outside of those hours. Both the mail room and control room are accessible from the
courtyard entrance on 20th Street between Constitution Avenue and C Street, NW. Comments must be received not later
than March 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petition for Reconsideration may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank
of Boston.

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the revised Food Chemicals
Codex policy on arsenic specifications. This new policy was recently approved by the National Academy of Sciences/Institute
of Medicine (NAS/IOM) Committee on Food Chemicals Codex (the committee). This revised policy is intended to be implemented
in the fourth edition of the Food Chemicals Codex, scheduled for release in early 1996.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA provides research contracts to NAS/IOM to support the preparation of the Food Chemicals Codex, a compendium of
specifications for substances used as food ingredients. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38129), FDA announced an opportunity for public comment on the committee's revised policy on
lead and heavy metals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA now gives notice that the committee is soliciting comments and information on a revised policy on arsenic specifications
and its proposed implementation. The revised policy is intended for implementation in the fourth edition of the Food
Chemicals Codex, which is scheduled for release in early 1996. FDA emphasizes, however, that it will not consider
adopting new Food Chemicals Codex monographs and monograph revisions until the public has had ample opportunity
to comment on them. The opportunity for public comment on new and revised monographs will be announced in a notice published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee regards the safety of properly used food chemicals as one of its goals. This means that Food Chemicals
Codex specifications will respond to advances in new manufacturing methods, analytical techniques, toxicology,
and safety issues. At the same time, where possible, the committee will reduce unnecessary burdens on manufacturers
and users of food ingredients. Currently, most monographs for Food Chemicals Codex substances include an arsenic
limit that requires testing to ensure compliance. The committee believes that arsenic is no longer a contemporary
concern in many Food Chemicals Codex substances for the following reasons: (1) The use of arsenic-containing materials
in agriculture and manufacturing has declined sharply and registrations for many arsenic-containing pesticides
have been revoked; (2) the heavy metals limit for many Food Chemicals Codex substances has been significantly reduced.
Because arsenic is one of the nine elements detected as a heavy metal, the test indirectly provides a safety net in those
rare cases where arsenic is present; and (3) arsenic has not been associated with or detected in most Food Chemicals
Codex substances with a long history of use. Therefore, the committee believes that the inclusion of arsenic limits
in Food Chemicals Codex monographs should not be routine, but that inclusion of such limits should be considered on
an ``as needed'' basis. The committee has adopted the following general policy: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The general policy for arsenic specifications in Food Chemicals Codex monographs is that an arsenic specification
be included in the requirements only when there is specific reason to believe that arsenic constitutes a significant
portion of the heavy metals limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To implement this policy in the fourth edition, the committee proposes deleting the arsenic specification from all
current monographs, except for the following substances where the arsenic specification will be retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))) and the regulations for affirmation
of GRAS status in &sect;170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), notice is given that Soya Oligo Japan, Inc., c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite
500, Washington, DC 20001, has filed a petition (GRASP 1G0369) proposing that soybean oligosaccharide syrup be affirmed
as GRAS when used as an ingredient in foods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The petition has been placed on display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Any petition that meets the requirements outlined in &sect;&sect;170.30 (21 CFR 170.30) and 170.35 is filed by the
agency. There is no prefiling review of the adequacy of data to support a GRAS conclusion. Thus, the filing of a petition
for GRAS affirmation should not be interpreted as a preliminary indication of suitability for GRAS affirmation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. If the agency finds that an environmental impact
statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding
of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before May 30, 1994, review the petition and/or file comments with the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). Two copies of any comment should be filed and should be identified with the docket number found
in brackets in the heading of this document. Comments should include any available information that would be helpful
in determining whether soybean oligosaccharide syrup is, or is not, GRAS for the proposed use and whether it should
be listed for use as an ingredient in foods. In addition, consistent with the regulations promulgated under the National
Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency encourages public participation by review of and comment
on the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice. A copy of the petition
(including the environmental assessment) and received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between

A. General Primary Care Services Delivery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant Amounts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is estimated that approximately $521 million in discretionary continuation grants for CHC activities (i.e.,
approximately $478 million for general primary care services delivery and $43 million for CPCP and SIMRI activities)
and approximately $59 million in discretionary grants for continuation of MHC activities (i.e., approximately
$57 million for general primary care services delivery and $2 million for CPCP and SIMRI activities) will be available
under sections 330 and 329 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 254c and 254b, respectively). Of the total
$45 million available for CPCP and SIMRI activities, approximately $10 million will be for SIMRI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, approximately $16 million will be available for existing C/MHCs to support the increased cost of providing
services to their current patients. Within the $16 million, approximately $10 million will be available for current
service adjustments, including support for the recruitment and retention of health care providers in C/MHCs, service
education linkages with academic institutions, school-based or school-linked programs, and activities to address
high prevalence morbidity and mortality (e.g., HIV/AIDS). Current service adjustments, where applicable, enable
C/MHCs to show the need for additional funds to maintain the existing range of services for the current number of patients
when existing levels of service cannot be supported with the total Federal and non-Federal revenue. The remaining
$6 million will be used for C/MHC improvement proposals to enhance the provision of required services. Such improvement
proposals should be presented in priority order. The improvement proposals for which funding may be made available
include the following required services: dental, pharmacy, culturally sensitive/ translation services, and case
management.

Number of Awards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of approximately 600 C/MHC grants will be made available, of which approximately 223 ($216 million) will be
for competing continuation grants and approximately 377 ($364 million) will be for non-competing continuation
grants. Approximately 300 of these grants will include CPCP and SIMRI activities. Grants will range from approximately
$200,000 to approximately $2 million for general primary care services delivery (C/MHC). Grants will range from
approximately $24,000 to approximately $450,000 for CPCP and SIMRI activities in C/MHCs. Awards will be made for
a one year budget period. SIMRI grantees will continue to have budget periods beginning September 30 for FY 1994. Project
periods will be for up to three years. Requests for current service adjustments and improvement proposals will be
included in the continuation grant application.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the intent of HRSA to continue to support health services in the service areas of currently funded C/MHCs, given
the unmet need inherent in their designation as medically underserved. Within their project periods, only present
grantees may apply for sections 329 and 330 awards to continue to provide health services in medically underserved
areas. However, any nonprofit private and public entities may apply to serve the geographic areas where project periods
are expiring. For a list of service areas with expiring project periods, see

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Review Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
When determining whether Federal support will be made available for continuing awards, the Department will review
C/MHCs for compliance with standard criteria stipulated in the program regulations (42 CFR part 51c for CHC and part
56 for MHC activities) and for how effectively they have used previously awarded sections 330 and 329 funds. This year's
reviews will continue to emphasize need and community impact, health services, management and finance, and governance.
Specifically, applications will be evaluated based on: (1) The demonstrated need for services based on geographic,
demographic, and economic factors, resources in the area, and health status; (2) the capacity to provide primary
health services as appropriate to meet the needs of the community, as evidenced by such attributes as an adequate medical
provider staff (e.g., number, specialty mix, and qualifications), critical linkages to other relevant entities
(e.g., State or local health departments, State Medicaid agencies, health professions training programs), and
coordination with other levels of care; (3) appropriate leadership, management structures and financial systems
to enable delivery of health services efficiently and effectively; (4) appropriateness of governing board composition,
committee structure, and performance to enable the board to function fully and effectively in its fiduciary role;
and (5) how the applicant integrates services supported by this grant with health services provided under other federally
assisted programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Capital Improvements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approximately $4.5 million will be available to support new major and minor capital improvements. Major capital
requests are requests for Federal grant support in excess of $100,000 and will fall into one of two categories: (1)
Proposals to correct major fire and life safety code violations; and (2) proposals to expand facilities to eliminate
overcrowding associated with an increased demand for services. Major capital improvements include: facility acquisition,
construction, alteration, renovation, expansion and modernization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minor capital improvements are requests for Federal grant support of less than $100,000. Minor capital proposals
submitted in continuation applications for FY 1994 should address the same categories of projects as those to be considered
for major capital projects, i.e., to correct fire and life safety code violations and to relieve overcrowding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emphasis will be given to capital proposals that correct existing fire and life safety code violations, particularly
violations that disrupt the delivery of primary care services and may pose a danger to health center patients and staff.
Fire and life safety code violations include those that are cited or clearly documented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Review Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applications for major capital will be reviewed against the following criteria: (1) Documented community need for
continued service delivery; (2) extent of the facility need; (3) appropriateness of site selection; (4) availability
of other sources of proposed financing; and (5) soundness of the proposal. Awards will be issued by September 30, 1994,
except for minor capital improvements which may be made sooner, depending on the nature of the building deficiency.

C. Comprehensive Perinatal Care Program and Special Infant Mortality Reduction Initiative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligible Applicants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
All CPCP and SIMRI awards are expected to be made as continuation awards to current recipients of CPCP and SIMRI funding
which are performing satisfactorily.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Review Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The review criteria for CPCP continuations, including SIMRI, are: (1) The extent to which the current and proposed
basic center operations are sound; (2) the extent to which infants born to the center's perinatal users are at high
risk for mortality and/or morbidity; (3) the extent to which the previous CPCP funding has been used to enhance the
basic perinatal services of the center, such as by provision of case management (risk assessment, coordination and
referral, follow-up and tracking, crisis intervention and documentation), outreach to targeted special populations
(e.g., homeless, HIV-infected, substance abusing, teenaged populations), patient education and counseling,
and home visiting; (4) the capability of the center to improve perinatal health as demonstrated through various process
and outcome measures of progress, such as increased perinatal caseload, increased first trimester enrollment,
reduced late or absent entry into care, increased post partum return rate, reduced incidence of low birth weight,
and increased newborn visits (an increase in perinatal caseload may also be a process indicator of progress in reaching
out to women to get them into care early); (5) the extent to which the plan is reasonable in that it: (a) addresses the
specific perinatal care needs of the community, focusing on women and infants at high risk of poor health status; (b)
further develops an appropriate system of care which includes collaboration with other resources; (c) contains
specific time-framed, measurable objectives, responsive to the CPCP and SIMRI expectations and the clinical measures;
and (d) contains an associated budget which is appropriate for the proposal in that it is in accordance with Federal
cost principles and corresponds to the proposed activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional review criteria for SIMRI applicants include: (1) For those SIMRI grantees in Healthy Start target areas,
the extent and effectiveness of collaborative efforts with the Healthy Start consortium; (2) the extent of collaborative
efforts with other Federal, State and local programs to develop integrated systems of perinatal care that address
the needs of the community; and (3) the extent to which the grantee's plan and progress demonstrate that SIMRI funds
are being used to effectively address gaps in perinatal services throughout the community.

Other Award Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
All grants to be awarded under this notice are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, as implemented by
45 CFR part 100, which allows States the option of setting up a system for reviewing applications from within their
States for assistance under certain Federal programs. The application kits will contain a listing of States which
have chosen to set up such a review system and will provide a point of contact in the States for that review. Applicants
(other than Federally recognized Indian Tribal governments) should contact their State Single Points of Contact
(SPOCs) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions
on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC
of each affected State. State process recommendations should be submitted to the appropriate Regional Office (see
Appendix). The due date for State process recommendations is 60 days after the appropriate application deadline
date. The Bureau of Primary Health Care does not guarantee that it will accommodate or explain its response to State
process recommendations received after this date.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces the proposed allocations to States of FY 1994 funds for social services under the Refugee Resettlement
Program (RRP). In order to help meet the special needs of former political prisoners from Vietnam, the Director proposes
to add to the formula allocation $2,000,000 in funds previously set aside for social services discretionary projects.
In the final notice, allocation amounts could be adjusted after considering comments and evidence from States on
population estimates. This notice proposes to eliminate the set-aside for mutual assistance associations (MAAs)
as a separate component of the social service allocations.

I. Amounts Proposed For Allocation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has available $80,802,000 in FY 1994 refugee social service funds as part
of the FY 1994 appropriation for the Department of Health and Human Services (Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;112).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the total of $80,802,000, the Director of ORR proposes to make available to States $68,681,700 (85%) under the allocation
formula set out in this notice. These funds would be made available for the purpose of providing social services to
refugees. In addition, the Director of ORR proposes to make available $2,000,000 from discretionary social service
funds to be allocated under the formula in this notice for additional services to former political prisoners from
Vietnam. The allocation amounts proposed in this notice could be adjusted slightly in the final notice after taking
into consideration any population adjustments (see Section VI, below). ORR intends FY 1994 to be the last year in which
a special set-aside will be allocated for additional services for former political prisoners from Vietnam.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Discretionary Social Service Funds for Vietnamese Political Prisoners
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In recognition of the special vulnerability of refugees who are former political prisoners from Vietnam, the Director
of ORR proposes to set aside $2,000,000 from discretionary social service funds to be allocated under the formula
set forth in this announcement, based on the number of actual political prisoner arrivals in FY 1993. This formula
allocation is shown separately in Table 1 (cols. 7 and 8). States are required to use this allocation to provide additional
services, as described below, to recent arrivals from Vietnam who are former political prisoners and members of their
families.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowable services for the above-cited funds for political prisoners include the following direct services: (1)
Specialized orientation and adjustment services, including peer support activities; and (2) specialized employment-related
services, as needed. Under no circumstances may these funds be used for direct cash payments or stipends, or for the
purchase of advertising space or air time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowable services under this allocation for Vietnamese political prisoners are intended to supplement, not to
supplant, those services provided to refugees in general under the social service formula allocation, discussed
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORR intends to provide technical assistance to States and organizations that request it to assure effective program
development and implementation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these funds are proposed to provide specifically for services for former political prisoners from Vietnam,
States which allocate social service funds to other local administrative jurisdictions, such as counties, shall
do so for these funds, using a formula which reflects recent and anticipated arrivals of this target population only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORR strongly encourages States and other contracting jurisdictions, in selecting service providers for the above,
to award these funds, to the extent possible, to qualified refugee mutual assistance associations with experience
serving the target population. All contractors receiving these funds should have Vietnamese language capacity
and Vietnamese cultural understanding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States are required to provide to ORR program performance information on the Vietnamese political prisoner program
that meets the reporting requirements contained in 45 CFR 92.40, under the terms and conditions of the social services
grant awards to States. This information, to be contained in the narrative portion of State quarterly performance
reports, must indicate: (1) Name of service contractors; (2) categories of activities provided; (3) numbers of persons
and types (former prisoners, family members, etc.) served; and (4) outcomes, to the extent possible.

B. Refugee Social Service Funds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The population figures for the social service allocation include refugees, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and Amerasians
from Vietnam since these populations may be served through funds addressed in this notice. (A State must, however,
have an approved State plan for the Cuban/Haitian Entrant Program in order to use funds on behalf of entrants as well
as refugees.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director proposes to allocate $68,681,700 to States on the basis of each State's proportion of the national population
of refugees who had been in the U.S. 3 years or less as of October 1, 1993 (including a floor amount for States which have
small refugee populations).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the 3-year population base in the allocation formula is required by section 412(c)(1)(B) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (INA) which states that the ``funds available for a fiscal year for grants and contracts [for social
services] *&blank;*&blank;* shall be allocated among the States based on the total number of refugees (including
children and adults) who arrived in the United States not more than 36 months before the beginning of such fiscal year
and who are actually residing in each State (taking into account secondary migration) as of the beginning of the fiscal
year.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As established in the FY 1991 social services notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 29, 1991, section I, ``Allocation Amounts'' (56 FR 42745), a variable floor amount for States which have
small refugee populations will be calculated as follows: If the application of the regular allocation formula yields
less than $100,000, then_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A base amount of $75,000 is provided for a State with a population of 50 or fewer refugees who have been in the U.S.
3 years or less; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For a State with more than 50 refugees who have been in the U.S. 3 years or less: (a) A floor has been calculated consisting
of $50,000 plus the regular per capita allocation for refugees above 50 up to a total of $100,000 (in other words, the
maximum under the floor formula is $100,000); (b) if this calculation has yielded less than $75,000, a base amount
of $75,000 is provided for the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORR has consistently supported floors for small States in order to provide sufficient funds to carry out a minimum
service program. Given the range in numbers of refugees in the small States, we have concluded that a variable floor,
as established in the FY 1991 notice, will be more reflective of needs than previous across-the-board floors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The $12,120,300 in remaining social service funds (15% of the total funds available) is expected to be used by ORR on
a discretionary basis to provide funds for individual projects intended to contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency
of the refugee resettlement program. Grant announcements on discretionary initiatives will be issued separately.

Population To Be Served
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the allocation formula is based on the 3-year refugee population, in accordance with the requirements of
45 CFR part 400 Subpart I_Refugee Social Services, States are not required to limit social service programs to refugees
who have been in the U.S. only 3 years. In keeping with 45 CFR 400.147(a), a State must allocate an appropriate portion
of its social service funds, based on population and service needs, as determined by the State, for services to newly
arriving refugees who have been in the U.S. less than one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While 45 CFR 400.147(b) requires that in providing employability services, a State must give priority to a refugee
who is receiving cash assistance, social service programs should not be limited exclusively to refugees who are cash
assistance recipients. If a State intends to provide services to refugees who have been in the U.S. more than 3 years,
45 CFR 400.147(c) requires the State to specify and justify as part of its Annual Services Plan those funds that it proposes
to use to provide services to those refugees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORR expects States to ensure that refugee social services are provided to special populations such as Amerasians
and former political prisoners from Vietnam, in addition to special funding that ORR may designate to address the
special needs of these populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORR funds may not be used to provide services to United States citizens, since they are not covered under the authorizing
legislation, with the following exceptions: (1) Under current regulations at 45 CFR 400.208, services may be provided
to a U.S.-born minor child in a family in which both parents are refugees or, if only one parent is present, in which that
parent is a refugee; and (2) under the FY 1989 Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations
Act (Pub. L. No. 100&hyph;461), services may be provided to an Amerasian from Vietnam who is a U.S. citizen and who enters
the U.S. after October 1, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Service Priorities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Refugee social service funding should be used to assist refugee families to achieve economic independence. To this
end, ORR expects States to ensure that a coherent plan of services is developed for each eligible family that addresses
the family's needs from time of arrival until attainment of economic independence. Each service plan should address
a family's needs for both employment-related services and other needed social services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reflecting section 412(a)(1)(A)(iv) of the INA, the Director expects States to ``insure that women have the same
opportunities as men to participate in training and instruction.'' In addition, States are expected to make sure
that services are provided in a manner that encourages the use of bilingual women on service agency staffs to ensure
adequate service access by refugee women. In order to facilitate refugee self-support, the Director also expects
States to implement strategies which address simultaneously the employment potential of both male and female wage
earners in a family unit, particularly in the case of large families. States are expected to make every effort to assure
the availability of day care services in order to allow women with children the opportunity to participate in employment
services or to accept or retain employment. To accomplish this, day care may be treated as a priority employment-related
service under the refugee social services program. Refugees who are participating in employment services or have
accepted employment are eligible for day care services. For an employed refugee, day care funded by refugee social
service dollars must be limited to one year after the refugee becomes employed. States are expected to use day care
funding from other publicly funded mainstream programs as a prior resource and are expected to work with service providers
to assure maximum access to other publicly funded resources for day care.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 45 CFR 400.146, if a State's cash assistance dependency rate for refugees (as defined in section
400.146(b)) is 55% or more, funds awarded under this notice (with the exception of the political prisoner set-aside)
are subject to a requirement that at least 85% of the State's award be used for employability services as set forth in
section 400.154. ORR expects these funds to be used for services which directly enhance refugee employment potential,
have specific employment objectives, and are designed to enable refugees to obtain jobs in less than one year as part
of a plan to achieve self-sufficiency. This reflects the Congressional objective that ``employable refugees should
be placed on jobs as soon as possible after their arrival in the United States'' and that social service funds be focused
on ``employment-related services, English-as-a-second-language training (in non-work hours where possible),
and case-management service'' (INA, section 412(a)(1)(B)). If refugee social service funds are used for the provision
of English language training, such training should be provided concurrently, rather than sequentially, with employment
or with other employment-related services, to the maximum extent possible. ORR also encourages the continued provision
of services after a refugee has entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move to a better job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since current welfare dependency data are not available, those States that historically have had dependency rates
at 55% and above are invited to submit a request for a waiver of the 85% requirement if they can provide reliable documentation
that demonstrates a lower dependency rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORR will consider granting a waiver of the 85% provision if a State meets one of the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of ORR that the dependency rate of refugees who have been
in the U.S. 24 months or less is below 55% in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that (a) less than 85% of the State's social service allocation
is sufficient to meet all employment-related needs of the State's refugees and (b) there are non-employment-related
service needs which are so extreme as to justify an allowance above the basic 15%. Or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In accordance with section 412(c)(1)(C) of the INA, the State submits to the Director a plan (established by or in
consultation with local governments) which the Director determines provides for the maximum appropriate provision
of employment-related services for, and the maximum placement of, employable refugees consistent with performance
standards established under section 106 of the Job Training Partnership Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refugee social services should be provided in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with a refugee's
language and cultural background. In light of the increasingly diverse population of refugees who are resettling
in this country, refugee service agencies will need to develop practical ways of providing culturally and linguistically
appropriate services to a changing ethnic population. To the maximum extent possible, particularly during a refugee's
initial years of resettlement, refugee social services should be provided through a refugee-specific system rather
than through a system in which refugees are only one of many client groups being served. When planning State refugee
services, States are strongly encouraged to take into account the reception and placement (R &amp; P) services provided
by local resettlement agencies in order to utilize these resources in the overall program design and to ensure the
provision of seamless services to refugees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to provide culturally and linguistically compatible services in as cost-efficient a manner as possible
in a time of limited resources, ORR encourages States and counties to promote and give special consideration to the
provision of refugee social services through coalitions of refugee service organizations, such as coalitions of
MAAs, voluntary resettlement agencies, or a variety of service providers. ORR believes it is essential for refugee-serving
organizations to form close partnerships in the provision of services to refugees in order to be able to respond adequately
to a changing refugee picture. Coalition-building and consolidation of providers is particularly important in
communities with multiple service providers in order to ensure better coordination of services and maximum use of
funding for services by minimizing the funds used for multiple administrative overhead costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States should also expect to use funds available under this notice to pay for social services which are provided to
refugees who participate in alternative projects. Section 412(e)(7)(A) of the INA provides that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary [of HSS] shall develop and implement alternative projects for refugees who have been in the United States
less than thirty-six months, under which refugees are provided interim support, medical services, support [social]
services, and case management, as needed, in a manner that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency,
and fosters greater coordination among the resettlement agencies and service providers.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision is generally known as the Wilson/Fish Amendment. The Department has already issued a separate notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with respect to applications for such projects (50 FR 24583, June 11, 1985). The notice on alternative projects does

notice. Therefore a State which may wish to consider carrying out such a project should take note of this in planning
its use of social service funds being allocated under the present notice.

Funding to MAAs

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ORR proposes to eliminate the set-aside for refugee mutual assistance associations as a separate component under
the social service notice and proposes instead to fold these funds into the social service formula allocation to States.
ORR believes that the continued and/or increased utilization of qualified refugee mutual assistance associations
in the delivery of social services helps to ensure the provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate services
as well as increasing the effectiveness of the overall service system. Therefore, at a minimum, ORR expects States
to continue to award refugee social service funds to MAAs at a level comparable to the MAA set-aside level in previous
years. In addition, ORR strongly encourages States when contracting for services, including employment services,
to give consideration to the special strengths of MAAs, whenever contract bidders are otherwise equally qualified,
provided that the MAA has the capability to deliver services in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible
with the background of the target population to be served.

ORR defines MAAs as organizations with the following qualifications:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States are reminded that under current regulations at 45 CFR 400.206 and 400.207, States have the flexibility to charge
the following types of administrative costs against their refugee program social service grants, if they so choose:
Direct and indirect administrative costs incurred for the overall management and operation of the State refugee
program, including its coordination, planning, policy and program development, oversight and monitoring, data
collection and reporting, and travel. See also State Transmittal No. 88&hyph;40.

III. Allocation Formula
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of the funds available for FY 1994 for social services, $68,681,700 is proposed to be allocated to States in accordance
with the formula specified below. A State's allowable allocation will be calculated as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The total amount of funds determined by the Director to be available for this purpose; divided by_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The total number of refugees and Cuban/Haitian entrants who arrived in the United States not more than 3 years prior
to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the funds are appropriated and the number of Amerasians from Vietnam eligible
for refugee social services, as shown by the ORR Refugee Data System. The resulting per capita amount will be multiplied
by_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The number of persons in item 2, above, in the State as of October 1, 1993, adjusted for estimated secondary migration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculation above will yield the formula allocation for each State. Minimum allocations for small States are
taken into account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allocations for political prisoners are based on FY 1993 arrival numbers for this group in each State from the Refugee
Data Center and are limited to States with 170 or more political prisoner arrivals. We have limited the population
base to FY 1993 political prisoner arrival numbers because these funds are intended to serve recent arrivals. We have
not included States with fewer than 170 former political prisoners in the political prisoner allocations formula
because the resulting level of funding would be insignificant. In these States, we believe the small number of political
prisoners could be adequately served under the State's refugee social services program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Basis of Population Estimates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The population estimates for the allocation of funds in FY 1994 are based on data on refugee arrivals from the ORR Refugee
Data System, adjusted as of October 1, 1993, for estimated secondary migration. The data base includes refugees of
all nationalities, Amerasians from Vietnam, and Cuban and Haitian entrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For fiscal year 1994, ORR's formula allocations for the States for social services are based on the number of refugees
and Amerasians who arrived, and on the numbers of entrants who arrived or were resettled, during the preceding three
fiscal years: 1991, 1992, and 1993, based on final arrival data by State. Therefore, estimates have been developed
of the numbers of refugees and entrants with arrival or resettlement dates between October 1, 1990, and September
30, 1993, who are thought to be living in each State as of October 1, 1993. Refugees admitted under the Federal Government's
private-sector initiative are not included, since their assistance and services are to be provided by the private
sponsoring organizations under an agreement with the Department of State.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The estimates of secondary migration were based on data submitted by all participating States on Form ORR&hyph;11.
The total migration reported by each State was summed, yielding in- and-out-migration figures and a net migration
figure for each State. The net migration figure was applied to the State's total arrival figure, resulting in a revised
population estimate. Because the reporting period covered on Form ORR&hyph;11 was a maximum of only 8 months as of
June 1993 for the majorigy of States whose reporting base was their cash/medical assistance caseload, extra weight
was given to the secondary migration reported by those States to arrive at estimates of secondary migration over a
36-month period. In 1993, no count of recently-arrived refugee children was available from the Department of Education
for use as a comparison.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimates were developed separately for refugees and entrants and then combined into a total estimated 3-year refugee/entrant
population for each State. Eligible Amerasians are included in the refugee figures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1, below, shows the estimated 3-year populations, as of October 1, 1993, of refugees (col. 1), entrants (col.
2), and total refugees and entrants (col. 3); the formula amounts which the population estimates yield (col. 4); and
the proposed allocation amounts after allowing for the minimum amounts (col. 5). Table 1 also shows the number of former
political prisoner arrivals in FY 1993 (col. 6); and the allocation amounts for services to this population (col.
7).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These population estimates and proposed allocation amounts are intended to be as close to the final figures as was
possible at the time they were developed. However, revisions may need to be made, based on data submitted by States
in accordance with Section VI of this notice, and all population estimates and allocation amounts may change somewhat
as a result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed explanation of the development of data used in this formula allocation can be obtained by writing to the
address indicated in Section VI of this notice.

The purpose of the FGDC National Spatial Data Infrastructure Competitive Cooperative Agreements Program (NSDICCAP)
is to facilitate and foster partnerships and alliances within and among various public and private entities to assist
in building the NSDI. The NSDI consists of policies, standards, agreements, and partnerships among a variety of sectors
and disciplines that will promote more cost-effective production, ready availability, and greater use of high quality
geospatial data. The NSDICCAP is intended to encourage resource-sharing projects, between and among the public
and private sector through the use of technology, networking, and enhanced interagency coordination efforts. Proposals
must involve two or more organizations, and participants are expected to cost share in the project. Activities initiated
under this program will promote development and maintenance of and access to data sets that are needed for national,
regional, State, and local analyses. Authority for this program is contained in the Department of the Interior and
Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;138.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this FY 1994 program announcement, proposals are to be directed towards two components of the NSDI. The first
component deals with creation of a distributed clearinghouse for finding and accessing geospatial data. The second
component involves development and promulgation of the use of standards in data collection, documentation, transfer,
and search and query. The following list of efforts is considered within the scope of the two aforementioned activities,
and are intended to serve as general parameters for consideration when developing proposals: Component I. Development
and implementation of the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse: Create (inventory, evaluate, catalog data,
and establish Internet access) and manage a node on the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse that provides users
with a means for finding, accessing, and sharing data; increase use and awareness of geospatial data available over
Internet through development of training programs, information guides and other explanatory materials in support
of a National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse; and, establish, develop, or expand programs or projects that improve
local, regional, or national access to geospatial data to the government, public and private sector. Component II.
Develop and further the implementation of FGDC-endorsed standards: Conduct programs to increase user comprehension
and adoption of the FGDC Metadata Standard and the Spatial Data Transfer Standard; test and evaluate existing and
proposed geospatial data standards; and, stimulate the development of geospatial data standards for consideration
by the FGDC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91&hyph;190 as amended),
the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS)
assessing the potential impacts of the proposed Development Concept Plan for Santa Rosa Island, Channel Islands
National Park, Santa Barbara County, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft plan proposes the development of infrastructure and facilities to support maintenance and protection
of resources and historic structures, research and further study of both natural and cultural resources, limited
experimental restoration of natural systems, and the provision of limited visitor use opportunities. Maintenance
and housing facilities would be provided in two locations. One alternative is evaluated, that of no action, which
would maintain existing housing, provide minimal maintenance of facilities to provide for basic health and safety

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of visitors and employees, and provide essential resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection with minimal research and planning for restoration of natural systems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Charles City Railway Lines, Inc. (CCRY), a 3.6 mile railroad in Charles City, Iowa, with connections to the Cedar
River Railroad Company (CRR) and the Soo Line Railroad Company (SOO) was shut down by its management effective with
the close of business February 24, 1994, due to a lack of operating funds, and has been out of operation since that time.
CCRY, based on its letter to shippers dated February 4, 1994 announcing cessation of operations effective February
24, 1994, placed Embargo No. 1&hyph;94, dated 2/14/94, which was effective 2/24/94. There are two principal shippers
located on the CCRY.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission was first contacted about the impending shutdown of the CCRY on February 10, 1994, by shippers on the
line, and on February 16, 1994, by the Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) indicating their concerns for the
possible shutdown of the railroad and requesting that the Commission consider issuing a directed service order (DSO).
IDOT's petition of February 16, 1994, requested the Commission to initiate voluntary directed service over the CCRY
lines and indicated that the CRR was willing to operate the CCRY lines as a ``Directed Rail Carrier'' (DRC). However,
it was not until February 28, 1994, that the CRR indicated its willingness to provide the uncompensated directed service
operations sought by IDOT and the two affected shippers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 11125(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act authorizes the Commission to act in situations where it finds that

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a rail carrier cannot transport traffic offered to it because_(1) its cash position makes its continuing operation
impossible; (2) transportation has been discontinued under court order; or (3) it has discontinued transportation
without obtaining a required certificate under 49 U.S.C. 10903
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (emphasis added). The initial period for the directed service order may not exceed 60 days. However, the order may
be extended for an additional period not to exceed 180 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a directed service order from the Commission, a directed carrier may voluntarily choose to provide directed
service without any subsidy or compensation to which it may be entitled from the Commission, as CRR has done here. See
St. Louis S.W. Ry. Co_Directed Service_Chicago, 363 I.C.C. 1 (1980), and Directed Service Order No. 1504, The New
York, Susquehanna and Western Railway Corporation_Directed Service_The Delaware and Hudson Railway Company,

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Considering the limited nature of the proposed directed service operation, e.g., only two active shippers on the
3.6 mile CCRY line, CRR has asked that in order for CRR to waive all compensation from the Federal government otherwise
applicable under 49 U.S.C. 11125(b)(5), that it be allowed to condition it's offer to provide uncompensated directed
service by limiting its initial 60-day operation to only those portions of the CCRY lines that CRR determines can be
safely operated; that CRR not be required to improve any CCRY lines that it believes are unsafe to operate; that it be
allowed to perform needed switching service to shippers using crews from its through trains, and that it be allowed
to utilize CCRY maintenance of way employees in conjunction with its own employees only to the extent practicable
for its limited operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering CCRY's cessation of service without alternative and its apparent inability to continue due to its cash
position, we find that CCRY's current situation meets the standards of 49 U.S.C. 11125(a)(1) and (3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the need for continued rail service over CCRY's lines and CRR's willingness to provide directed service
without compensation from the Federal government, this decision grants the requests of interested parties for interim
service authority to CRR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emergency nature of the situation compels us to conclude that advance public notice and hearings would be impractical
and contrary to the immediate public interest in assuring the immediate resumption of essential rail transportation
services. Accordingly, we exercise our authority under 49 U.S.C. 11125(a) to waive advance public notice in the present
circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 11125 permits us to direct service for an initial period of not more than 60 days, with an option to extend the
directed service period for an additional 180 days, if cause exists. We believe directed service authority to be necessary
here at least for an initial 60 day period. Any interested person may file comments on this action during this period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
We Find
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. CCRY had discontinued service over all of its lines. CRR has requested the Commission to permit it to provide continued
rail service over those lines which it considers to be operable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To prevent transportation and economic disruptions due to CCRY's ceased operations, and to assure the immediate
continued movement of commodities, some of which may be perishable, it is necessary for the Commission to authorize
CRR to operate CCRY's lines at Charles City, Iowa under 49 U.S.C. 11125, conditioned upon a waiver of any compensation
or subsidy from the Federal government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Our action in this decision will not substantially impair the ability of CRR to serve its own patrons adequately,
or meet its outstanding common carrier obligations, see 49 U.S.C. 11125(b)(2)(B), and will assure continued rail
service to affected shippers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or energy conservation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Port Railroads, Inc. (PRI), a noncarrier subsidiary of Kyle Railways, Inc. (Kyle) has filed a notice of exemption
to lease and operate approximately 107.438 miles of railroad lines of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company
in Fresno and Kern Counties, CA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lines involved in the lease transaction consist of: (1) The West Side Line: Between milepost 207.138 on the west
leg of the wye and milepost 207.260 on the east leg of the wye, at Fresno, CA, and the end of the line at milepost 159.60
at Oxalis, CA; (2) the Riverdale Branch: Between milepost 182.003 at Ingle, CA, and the end of the line at milepost 208.73
at Burrell, CA; and (3) the Buttonwillow Branch: Between milepost 313.649 on the west leg of the wye and milepost 314.020
on the east leg of the wye, at Kern Junction in Bakersfield, CA, and the end of line at milepost 347.00 at Buttonwillow,
CA. The parties expected to consummate the proposed transaction on or after March 6, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proceeding is related to Finance Docket No. 32458, Kyle Railways, Inc._Continuance in Control Exemption_Port
Railroads, Inc., wherein Kyle has concurrently filed a petition for exemption to continue in control of PRI and seven
other railroads upon PRI becoming a railroad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any comments must be filed with the Commission and served on: Fritz R. Kahn, Esq., suite 120, 1101 30th St., NW., Washington,
DC 20007.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice is filed under 49 CFR 1150.31. If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is
void 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ab initio.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on February 15, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm engaged in employment related to the production of office filing supplies. The certification notice was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 4, 1994 (59 FR 10429).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The
findings show that several workers were laid off a few months prior to the Department's impact date of August 1, 1993.
The findings also show that the workers were laid off as a result of a company decision to import office filing supplies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification with a new impact date of April 1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,213 is hereby issued as follows: All workers of Smead Manufacturing
Company, Hastings, Minnesota engaged in employment related to the production of office filing supplies who became
totally or partially separated from employment on or after April 1, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance
under section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

The Employment and Training Administration interprets Federal law requirements pertaining to unemployment compensation
as part of its role in the administration of the Federal-State unemployment compensation program. These interpretations
are issued in Unemployment Insurance Program Letters (UIPLs) to the State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs).
The UPLs described below are published in the Federal Register

This UIPL advises SESAs of the provisions of Public Law (Pub. L.) 103&hyph;152 which affect the unemployment compensation
(UC) program. Public Law 103&hyph;152 requires that States establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants
for regular UC in order to identify those claimants most likely to exhaust regular UC and in need of reemployment services
in order to obtain new work. It also requires that an individual identified pursuant to the profiling system must participate
in reemployment services as a condition of UC eligibility.

Background.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 24, 1993, the President signed into law the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1993, Public Law
103&hyph;152. Public Law 103&hyph;152 extended the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program, and amended
the SSA to require States, as a condition of receiving administrative grants, to establish and utilize a system of
profiling all new claimants for regular UC for purposes of identifying claimants who are likely to exhaust UC and will
need job search assistance to make a successful transition to new employment. The SSA was further amended to require
States to disqualify an individual identified pursuant this profiling system if the individual fails to participate
in reemployment services. In addition, Public Law 103&hyph;152 made a technical change to Title IX of the SSA. States
have already been advised of those provisions affecting the EUC program in GAL 12&hyph;92, Change 6. This issuance
is limited to those amendments to the SSA affecting the Federal-State UC program. These amendments are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) a new requirement that States establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for regular UC;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Profiling_Situation Prior to Enactment of Public Law 103&hyph;152. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Profling is based on the premise that a set of characteristics_a ``profile''_can be developed to identify, at an early
stage of unemployment, which workers are likely to exhaust UC and will need assistance to find new jobs. Research on
this point sponsored by the Department of Labor and conducted in the State of New Jersey found that profiled claimants
who received reemployment services returned to work earlier than those who did not receive such services. (See UI
Occasional Papers 89&hyph;3 and 91&hyph;1 which contain reports on the New Jersey project). In addition, studies
on the long-term unemployed have found that individual characteristics such as schooling and job tenure relate to
when the individuals return to work. Thus, providing early reemployment assistance to individuals most likely to
remain out of work should result in an earlier return to work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4 of Public Law 103&hyph;6 addressed the establishment of a system of profiling all new claimants for regular
UC (including new claimants under Federal unemployment benefit allowance programs) to determine which claimants
may be most likely to exhaust regular UC and may need reemployment services to make a successful transition to new employment.
Although States were not required to establish a system of profiling, the Secretary was directed to ``encourag[e]
[its] adoption and implementation by all States,'' as well as provide ``technical assistance and advice to the States
in the development of model profiling systems.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to this legislation, the Department took action to develop a model profiling system. UIPL 45&hyph;93
was issued and States were encouraged to provide comments on the profiling system and the procedures needed to implement
it. The Department was in the process of developing this system and a strategy for its implementation when Public Law
103&hyph;152 was enacted.

The amendments made by Public Law 103&hyph;152 repealed section 4 of Public Law 103&hyph;6 and added subsection (j)
to section 303, SSA, to require States, as a condition for receiving Title III grants, to implement and utilize a system
of profiling all new claimants for regular UC. Under section 303(j)(1), SSA, the system must include components which:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Identify which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular UC and will need job search assistance services to make
a successful transition to new employment.

2. Refer the claimants described in item 1 above to reemployment services, such as job search assistance services,
available under any State or Federal law. The conference Committee Report defines ``reemployment services'' as:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Collect follow-up information relating to the services received by such claimants and their employment outcomes
and use the information for future profiling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Meet ``such other requirements as the Secretary of Labor determines are appropriate.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Labor will provide further guidance concerning ``reemployment services,'' job search assistance,''
``follow-up information,'' ``employment outcomes'' and any other requirements the Secretary of Labor determines
to be necessary for the proper implementation of a profiling system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(c) of Public Law 103&hyph;152 requires that the ``Secretary of Labor shall provide technical assistance
and advice to assist the States in implementing the profiling system'' and that ``such assistance shall include the
development and identification of model profiling systems.'' The Department of Labor plans to provide technical
assistance to States. Information concerning this assistance and the model profiling systems will be provided in
future issuances.

Section 4(d) of Public Law 103&hyph;152 requires that, not later than the date three years after the date of enactment
of Public Law 103&hyph;152, the Secretary of Labor will report to the Congress on the operation and effectiveness
of the profiling system and of the participation requirement described in Attachment II below. Since Public Law 103&hyph;152

State which has not appropriately amended its law and/or not established a profiling system by this effective date,
the Department of Labor will take into consideration the feasibility of such State taking that action to meet the requirements

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(10) A requirement that, as a condition of eligibility for regular compensation for any week, any claimant who has
been referred to reemployment services pursuant to the profiling system under subsection (j)(1)(B) participate
in such services or in similar services unless the State agency charged with the administration of the State law determines_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(A) Such claimant has completed such services; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Discussion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 103&hyph;152 added section 303(a)(10) to the SSA to require States, as a condition of receiving Title III
grants, to place an additional condition of eligibility on claimants who have been referred to reemployment services
pursuant to the profiling system under subsection 303(j)(1)(B), SSA. A profiled claimant, in order to be eligible
for regular UC for any given week, must participate in reemployment services or similar services unless the State
agency determines that (1) the profiled claimant has already completed such services; or (2) there is a justifiable
cause for the claimant's failure to participate in such services. The Department of Labor will provide further guidance
to States concerning participation in ``reemployment services'' or ``similar services'' and ``justifiable cause.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes States will need to amend their laws to provide for a disqualification based on a profiled
claimant's failure to participate in reemployment services. If a State does not need to make such a law change, it will
be necessary to notify the Department that such a disqualification can be accomplished without amendment.

one year after the date of the enactment of this Act,'' or November 24, 1994. In determining whether to take action against
a State which has not met this requirement by this effective date, the Department of Labor will take into consideration
the feasibility of such State timely amending its law and establishing a profiling system (which is a necessary requisite
to this denial provision) which meets the requirements established by the Department in its operating instructions.

 The legislation proposed which eventually became Public Law 103&hyph;318 contained a provision which would have

corresponding amendments to section 905(b) were included in the enacted version of Public Law 103&hyph;319. As these
amendments referred to non-existent sections, the amendments had no effect. Section 5 of Public Law 103&hyph;152
amended Section 905(b), SSA, to delete the erroneously enacted language pertaining to the non-existing section.

Background. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 8, 1993, the President signed into law the NAFTA, Public Law 100&hyph;182, which affects the UC program
in two ways. First, NAFTA created a transitional adjustment assistance program designed to address worker dislocation
caused by NAFTA. This aspect of NAFTA was addressed in GAL 7&hyph;94. Second, NAFTA amended Federal law to give States
the option of permitting, for a five-year period, certain individuals to receive a payment from the State's unemployment
fund for the purpose of assisting such individuals in establishing a business and becoming self-employed. It is this
second aspect of NAFTA which is the subject of this UIPL.

a. In General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``withdrawal standard'' of Section 3304(a)(4), FUTA, and section 303(a)(5), SSA, limits withdrawals (with
specified exceptions not relevant here) from a State's unemployment fund to payments of ``compensation'' and prior
to the enactment of NAFTA would have prohibited withdrawals for the purpose of paying self-employment allowances.
The term ``compensation'' is defined in section 3306(h), FUTA, as ``cash benefits payable to individuals with respect
to their unemployment.'' Due to this requirement that the payment be with respect to ``unemployment,'' the withdrawal
standard has previously, with one temporary exception, prohibited States from using unemployment funds to assist
individuals in establishing themselves in self-employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The previous temporary exception was created by section 9152 of Public Law 100&hyph;203, the Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1987. Public Law 100&hyph;203 authorized three demonstration projects to test the feasibility of providing
self-employment allowances, payable from a State's unemployment fund, to individuals. Only Massachusetts operated
a demonstration project. The initial report on this project was issued in UI Occasional Paper 92&hyph;2, Self-Employment
Programs for Unemployed Workers, and is available by writing Ingrid Evans, United States Department of Labor, Unemployment
Insurance Service, 200 Constitution Ave. NW., room S&hyph;4231, Washington, DC 20210. A final report will be available
in 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAFTA amended Federal law to allow payments to self-employed individuals under specified conditions during the
five years following NAFTA's date of enactment. The report of the House Ways and Means Committee describes the intent
behind the new Self-employment provision:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Providing States the authority to establish and operate self-employment programs would significantly benefit
workers that may be dislocated because of the NAFTA. The traditional system of unemployment compensation is primarily
designed to provide income support for workers who are temporarily laid off or expect to be unemployed for only a short
time. However, as a result of the NAFTA, some workers may lose their jobs permanently and need additional tools besides
the basic income maintenance provided by the unemployment insurance system in order to re-enter the work force. For
some of those workers, access to a self-employment program would be the best path for them to re-enter the work force.
This provision gives states the ability to add the tool of self-employment training and support to the options available
to help speed the transition of dislocated workers back into the work force. [H. Rept. No. 361, Part 1, 103rd Cong.,
1st Sess. 94 (1993).]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, section 507, NAFTA, amended the withdrawal standard (and the definition of ``unemployment fund''
in section 3306(f), FUTA) to provide that amounts may be withdrawn from the unemployment fund of a State ``for the payment
of allowances under a self-employment assistance program (as defined in section 3306(t)) *&blank;*&blank;*''
FUTA. This exception to the withdrawal standard applies solely to the self-employment assistance (SEA) allowances
described in section 3306(t), FUTA, which was also added to FUTA by section 507(a), NAFTA. Under new section 3306(t)(1),
SEA allowances are payable ``in lieu of regular'' UC for the purposes of assisting individuals in establishing a business
and becoming self-employed.

Eligibility for SEA Allowances. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
SEA allowances are to be payable ``in the same amount, at the same interval [e.g., payment with respect to a period will
be made weekly if that is the State's usual practice for claims for regular UC or every other week if that is the usual
practice], on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as'' regular UC. (Section 3306(t)(2), FUTA.) This
``equal treatment'' provision applies to all monetary and nonmonetary (including reporting and certification)
eligibility requirements except where specifically prohibited by other provisions of Federal law pertaining to
SEA allowances. It also applies to notice and appeal rights.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since individuals engaged in self-employment activities will normally be disqualified if certain eligibility
provisions for State UC are followed, section 3306(t)(2), FUTA, provides that these provisions of State law shall
not be followed. Specifically, the following provisions shall not apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) State requirements relating to availability for work, active search for work, and refusal to accept work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) State requirements relating to disqualifying income are not applicable to income earned from self-employment
by individuals claiming SEA allowances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, individuals in the SEA program will be considered to be ``unemployed'' for purposes of both Federal and
State UC laws provided the individuals meet provisions of State law subject to the above equal treatment provision
and four additional eligibility provisions for SEA allowances discussed immediately below. (The effect of this
requirement on Federal law is discussed below in item 4.f.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3306(t)(3), FUTA, contains the four additional eligibility provisions which individuals must meet to receive
SEA allowances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) They must be eligible to receive regular UC under the State law (or they would be eligible but for the requirements
suspended by the SEA provisions at section 3306(t)(2), FUTA, as discussed above). This is basically a restatement
of the ``equal treatment'' requirement of section 3306(t)(1), FUTA, and includes monetary as well as initial and
continuing nonmonetary eligibility. For purposes of determining SEA eligibility, ``regular compensation'' includes
UC for ex-servicemembers (UCX) and former Federal employees (UCFE). (See item 4.g below.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the SEA allowance is ``in lieu of'' regular UC, the total amount of SEA allowances that individuals may receive
is equal to their maximum benefit amount of regular UC less any regular UC previously received. Similarly, the weekly
SEA allowance amount must equal the weekly benefit amount for regular UC. Also, SEA allowances and regular UC may not
be paid for the same period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``regular compensation'' is defined in section 205(2), EUCA, as ``compensation payable to an individual
under any State unemployment compensation law (including compensation payable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 85),
other than extended compensation and additional compensation.'' Thus, individuals who have exhausted regular
UC are ineligible for SEA allowances. Individuals may not receive SEA allowances in lieu of Federal-State extended
benefits (EB), additional benefits (AB) entirely financed by the State, any wholly funded Federal extension of UC,
or other types of compensation not meeting the definition of regular UC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals who are terminated from or voluntarily leave the SEA program may collect regular UC with respect to the
benefit year (if otherwise eligible) until the total amount of regular UC paid and SEA paid equals the maximum benefit
amount. Such individuals may be paid EB if otherwise eligible. This is because, under 20 CFR 615.5(a)(1), these individuals
are ``exhaustees'' for EB purposes because they have received ``all of the regular compensation that was payable
under the applicable State law *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Similarly, individuals who exhaust the maximum benefit amount
as SEA program participants may also receive EB if otherwise eligible. Whether any of the individuals discussed in
this paragraph are eligible for other Federal extensions will depend on the law creating the extension. Whether individuals
are eligible for AB will be determined by State law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The individuals must be identified pursuant to a State worker profiling system as likely to exhaust regular UC.
For further discussion of SEA profiling requirements, refer to items 4.d and 4.j of this UIPL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The individuals are participating in self-employment assistance activities which are approved by the State
agency. State agency is defined in Section 3306(e), FUTA, as the authority ``designated under a State law to administer
the unemployment fund in such State.'' The activities which must be offered the individuals are entrepreneurial
training, business counseling, and technical assistance. (Information concerning these activities may be found
in UI Occasional Paper 92&hyph;2, which describes services provided to claimants participating in the self-employment
demonstration programs in Washington and Massachusetts.) If these activities are not available, an individual
pursuing self-employment will not be eligible for SEA allowances; determination of eligibility for regular UC for
such individuals will be made under State law provisions relating to self-employment. The activities may be offered
by either private or public entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An individual who fails to participate in a scheduled activity (e.g., failure to attend a scheduled training course)
is not considered to be participating in SEA program activities. However, for purposes of receiving a SEA allowance,
it is not always necessary for the individual to have actually participated in SEA program activities for the week
claimed. What is, at a minimum, necessary is that the individual be participating in a program (approved by the State
agency) which provides training programs on an ongoing basis and allows individuals to avail themselves of other
SEA program services when they are needed. As long as individuals are under such a program, even though no activities
are scheduled for a given week, they will be considered to be participating in SEA program activities and may be paid
SEA allowances. It is possible that an individual may be eligible for both regular UC and the SEA allowance. This will
occur when the individual is participating in training related to self-employment which is also approved training
under State law. In this instance, the State is free to determine whether regular UC or the SEA allowance will be paid
as long the eligibility requirements for the respective program are met. However, in no instance may both regular
UC and the SEA allowances be paid with respect to the same period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since States do not disqualify individuals under their regular UC laws for failure to participate in SEA program activities,
the SEA ``equal treatment'' provision does not address what disqualifications States may impose in these cases.
It is recommended that States disqualify these individuals from receipt of SEA allowances only for the week the failure
to participate occurs. Such individuals may be eligible for regular UC for that week if State law provisions relating
to regular UC are met. Individuals who fail to meet the participation requirement may be dropped by the State from the
SEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) They are actively engaged on a full-time basis in activities (which may include training) relating to the establishment
of a business and becoming self-employed. The Department of Labor (``Department'') is researching the relationship
of this requirement to the Americans with Disabilities Act. When this research is completed, guidance on what constitutes
a ``full-time basis'' will be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is the case with failing to participate in SEA activities, States do not currently disqualify individuals under
their regular UC laws for failure to actively engage on a full-time basis relating to the establishment of a business
and becoming self-employed. Therefore, the SEA ``equal treatment'' provision does not address what disqualifications
States may impose in these cases. It is recommended that States disqualify these individuals from receipt of SEA allowances
only for the week the failure to actively engage on a full-time basis occurs. Such individuals may be eligible for regular
UC for that week if State law provisions relating to regular UC are met. Individuals who fail to meet the ``full-time''
requirement may be dropped by the State from the SEA program.

5 Percent Rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3306(t)(4), FUTA, places a limitation on the number of individuals in a State who may receive SEA allowances.
Specifically, it provides that the aggregate number of individuals receiving the allowance must ``not at any time
exceed 5 percent of the number of individuals receiving regular unemployment compensation under the State law at
such time *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The Department will monitor this ``5 percent test'' on a monthly basis. Therefore,
States must use at least a monthly measurement period as well. The calculation relates to individuals actually receiving
(i.e., paid) SEA for the week as a percent of those receiving regular UC for the same week. Thus, for example, if 10,000
individuals receive regular UC (including UCFE and UCX) for a given week, then no more than 500 may receive SEA allowances
(including UCFE and UCX claimants).

Note:

number of individuals receiving regular UC.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The 5 percent figure is an express limitation which the State may not exceed. Therefore, States must monitor SEA allowance
payments closely to assure that the 5 percent limitation is not exceeded. The Department recommends that new individuals
not be added to the SEA program if it appears the 5 percent threshold may be exceeded.

No Cost to Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3306(t)(5), FUTA, places an additional requirement on the States as a condition of paying SEA allowances.
It provides that the payment of SEA allowances must not result in any cost to the UTF ``in excess of the cost that would
be incurred by such State and charged to such [Unemployment Trust] Fund if the State had not participated in'' the SEA
program. Put simply, payment of SEA allowances may not result in any additional benefit charges to the UTF. This limitation
applies only to the benefit costs associated with the payment of SEA/regular UC. It does not apply to the charging of
SEA allowances to employers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since individuals successfully establishing themselves in self-employment will not collect EB, the UTF will accrue
some savings to the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account and the State's account. However, since EB is not
always payable in a State, the Department has determined that this ``no cost'' requirement will be met only if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The State implements a profiling system which assures that only claimants likely to exhaust regular UC will receive
SEA allowances. An inadequate profiling system were those likely to not exhaust regular UC are allowed to receive
SEA allowances will not meet the ``no cost'' requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State creates ``participation requirements'' designed to assure SEA allowances are paid only to those who
actually participate in the SEA program. Participation requirements for determining if an individual is actively
engaged on a full-time basis in SEA activities must be at least as stringent as the able and available requirements
for regular UC; otherwise the SEA program will not meet the ``no cost'' requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More information on what is required of States in these areas is described in item 4.j below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
State Reports. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(c), NAFTA, provides that any State operating a SEA program authorized by the Secretary of Labor must report
annually to the Secretary the number of individuals who participate in the SEA program, the number of individuals
who are able to develop and sustain businesses (e.g., business survival data), the cost of operating the SEA program,
and compliance with program requirements. The report must also contain other relevant data needed by the Department,
including data related to business income, number of employees and wages paid in the new businesses, and incidence
and duration of unemployment after business start-up.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State reports will be submitted with respect to a calendar year and will be due the June 30 following the report year.
This means the first report may be for only part of a year. For example, if a State's SEA program is effective April 1,
1994, then the first annual report will be due on June 30, 1995 and will cover a nine-month period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to submit the report as required will create an issue under section 303(a)(6), SSA, which requires that, as
a condition of receipt of administrative grants for the UC program, State law provides for ``the making of such reports,
in such form and containing such information, as the Secretary of Labor may from time to time require *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 507(d), NAFTA, the Secretary of Labor is required to submit a report to Congress with respect to the SEA
program not later than four years after the date of enactment of NAFTA. Since NAFTA was enacted on December 8, 1993,
this report is due no later than December 8, 1997. This report will be based on the reports from the States operating
SEA programs.

Individuals Receiving SEA considered to be Unemployed. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in item 4.a, section 3306(h) defines ``compensation'' as ``cash benefits payable to individuals with respect
to their unemployment.'' Payments to self-employed individuals are not compensation since they are not payable
with respect to unemployment. However, under section 3306(t)(2)(c), FUTA, individuals to whom the SEA allowances
are payable ``are considered to be unemployed for the purposes of Federal and State laws applicable to unemployment
compensation, as long as such individuals meet the requirements'' of section 3306(t). The effect of this provision
is that, with respect to SEA, individuals are considered to be unemployed and payments made to them are considered
to be ``compensation.'' Thus, the term ``compensation'' is considered to include individuals eligible for SEA allowances.
The term ``regular compensation'' does not, however, include SEA allowances. This is because under Section 3306(t)(1),
FUTA, SEA is payable ``in lieu of'' regular UC.

Equal Treatment Requirements Elsewhere in Federal Law. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the SEA ``equal treatment'' requirement in Section 3306(t)(2), FUTA, Federal law contains two other
equal treatment requirements mandating payment of compensation ``in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject
to the same conditions'' as UC payable under State law. One requirement is found in section 3304(a)(6)(A), FUTA, and
pertains to payment of UC based on services performed for State and local governments and certain nonprofit entities,
commonly called ``reimbursing'' employers. The other requirement is found in 5 U.S.C. 8502(b) and pertains to payment
of UCX and UCFE. As noted in item 1.f, above, the term ``compensation'' is considered to include SEA allowances. Therefore,
individuals who perform services covered under these two additional ``equal treatment'' provisions must be given
the option of receiving SEA allowances. The payment of SEA allowances does not require an amendment to the UCFE/UCX
agreement.

The ``equal treatment'' requirement contained in section 3306(t)(2), FUTA, provides that SEA allowances will be
``payable in the same amount, at the same interval, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions, as regular
unemployment compensation under the State law *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Thus, SEA allowances must be paid to all eligible
individuals to whom regular UC is payable under State law, including individuals who performed services to which
section 3304(a)(6)(A), FUTA, and 5 U.S.C. chapter 85 apply.

Financing of SEA Allowances. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Experience Rated Employers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3303(a)(1), FUTA, requires, as a condition of employers in a State obtaining the additional credit against
the Federal unemployment tax, that no reduced contribution rate be assigned an employer, except on the basis of ``experience
with respect to unemployment or other factors bearing a direct relation to unemployment risk *&blank;*&blank;*.''
All but one of the existing experience rating systems consist of charging payments of compensation or benefit wages
to an employer who had previously provided employment to the compensated individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in item 1.f, under section 3306(t)(2)(c), FUTA, individuals to whom the SEA allowance is payable ``are considered
to be unemployed for the purposes of Federal and State laws applicable to unemployment compensation *&blank;*&blank;*.''
Under this provision, SEA allowances reflect ``experience with respect to unemployment or other factors bearing
a direct relation to unemployment risk'' for purposes of section 3303(a)(1), FUTA. Therefore, the measurement of
an employer's experience through charges based on SEA allowances is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In charging SEA allowances, States must use the same method of charging (e.g., charging base period employers proportionately)
and noncharge in the same situations (e.g., noncharging claims where the individual has voluntarily quit) as apply
to regular UC. To fail to do this would raise an issue under the ``uniform method'' requirement of section 3303(a)(1),
FUTA. See UIPL 29&hyph;83, Change 1, dated September 24, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will address the issue of whether SEA allowances may be noncharged when it develops a comprehensive
noncharging policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(The one experience rating system not using payments of compensation or benefit wages is Alaska which uses a payroll
decline system. The Department believes this system will not be affected by the payment of SEA allowances.)

Section 3309(a)(2), FUTA, provides that costs ``of compensation attributable under the State law'' to service performed
for State and local governments and nonprofit organizations to which that section pertains must be reimbursed by
such entities. Since, as discussed in item 1.f, SEA allowances are considered to be compensation, this requirement
also applies to SEA allowances.

Required Plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 3306(t)(6), FUTA, provides that a State SEA program must meet ``such other requirements as the Secretary
of Labor determines to be appropriate.'' Secretary's Order No. 4&hyph;75 (40 FR 18515) gives the Department the authority
to make this determination. The Department has determined that, prior to implementing a SEA program, the Department
must approve a State plan. This approval process will assure an orderly start-up of the SEA program in a State. To be
approved the plan must contain:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A description of the profiling system used to identify SEA program participants. The State has three options for
choosing a profiling system:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Using elements of the statistical model developed by the Department for purposes of providing technical assistance
in implementing Section 303(j), SSA. (Section 303(j), SSA, requires States to establish and use a system of profiling
all new claimants for regular UC.) The report on the profiling model, Profiling Dislocated Workers for Early Referral
to Reemployment Services by Kelleen Worden (October 6, 1993), is available from the appropriate Regional Office.
If this model is used, States must re-estimate the coefficients using State data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A statistical model developed by the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Another profiling method developed by the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of which option is chosen, the State must demonstrate that its system has a high degree of accuracy for purposes
of meeting the cost-neutrality requirement discussed in item 4.d. For this reason, the State must submit with its
plan a baseline analysis of historical data indicating the extent to which the exhaustion rate of individuals identified
by the proposed system exceeds the exhaustion rate of the population of all beneficiaries under the regular UC program.
The determination of whether the system is sufficiently accurate will be made by the Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assurances that the annual report will be submitted as required and contain such information as required by this
UIPL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A description of participation requirements including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The structured set of services provided to individuals in the SEA program. The description must address the working
relationship of the State agency with any entity (such as a State economic development agency or an agency administering
the Job Training Partnership Act) providing services under the SEA program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A description of what actions (such as certification procedures) the States will take to assure SEA participants
are engaged ``on a full-time basis'' in self-employment activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Legislative language implementing the SEA program consistent with the requirements of this UIPL. (Draft language
is provided in Attachment II and a Commentary in Attachment III.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A description of the source (and amount of) funds for paying for SEA program activities such as entrepreneurial

for these activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Assurances that the payment of SEA allowances will not create any additional benefit costs to the UTF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Since no State may commence operation of a SEA program without approval of a plan by the Department, States may expedite
implementation of the SEA program by submitting their plans prior to obtaining legislation. Although the Department
may provide provisional approval of a plan prior to enactment, it will not approve any plan until certified copies
of SEA legislation are provided by the State. Any modifications to an approved plan are to be submitted to the Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed plans and modifications to approved plans are to be submitted to the appropriate Regional Office.

Effective Date and Termination Date of SEA Programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 507(e), NAFTA, the provisions of Federal law relating to SEA programs are effective on the date of enactment
of NAFTA. In addition, these provisions provide only temporary exceptions to the withdrawal standard. The authority
to operate SEA programs expires five years after the date of enactment of NAFTA. Since NAFTA was enacted on December
8, 1993, the SEA program provisions were effective on that date and expire on December 8, 1998.

(a) General Rule._Section 3306 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new
subsection: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(t) Self-Employment Assistance Program._For the purposes of this chapter, the term `self-employment assistance
program' means a program under which_

Commentary on the Draft Language to Implement a Self-Employment Assistance Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This commentary should be used in conjunction with Section 4 of this UIPL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States will need to make adjustments in the draft language to accommodate State law conventions. Blanks have been
provided for inserting cites to relevant sections of the State law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Self-employment assistance activities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 These activities are defined consistent with section 3306(t)(3)(C) and (D), FUTA. States should note that the approval
of the State agency is limited to the self-employment ``activities'' themselves. States may not base a denial of approval
on factors unrelated to the self-employment assistance activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Self-employment assistance allowance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section defines the SEA allowance and establishes that such allowances are to be paid from the State's unemployment
fund. States may also wish to consider whether to amend the section of State law which governs withdrawals from the
unemployment fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Regular Benefits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A definition of ``regular benefits'' (or ``regular compensation'') is necessary since SEA allowances are payable
``in lieu of'' regular compensation. State law may already contain a definition of regular benefits in which case
the addition of this definition may not be necessary. Some State laws contain a definition of regular benefits in the
sections pertaining to EB. In these cases, the State will need to determine whether the definition is limited to the
EB section, and, therefore, whether a cross-reference is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Full-time basis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since the Department is not at this time providing a specific definition of ``full-time basis,'' it is recommended
that States reserve the right to prescribe the definition in regulations in order to assure consistency with Federal
law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Amount of self-employment assistance allowance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section governs the weekly and maximum amount of SEA allowance payable. It assures that SEA allowances are paid
``in the same amount'' as regular UC. It also clarifies the relationship between payments of regular UC and SEA allowances
with respect to a benefit year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility for self-employment assistance allowance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section contains the ``equal treatment'' requirement of Section 3306(t)(2), FUTA (except for the requirement
that SEA allowances be paid ``in the same amount'' which is contained in subsection (b) above). It also contains the
three exceptions to the ``equal treatment'' requirement which are found in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of section
3306(t)(2), FUTA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By cross referencing the definition of ``self-employment assistance activities,'' this provision should assure
payment only to those participating in such activities. It also contains the requirement of section 3306(t)(3) (D)
that the individual be actively engaged in a full-time basis in activities relating to the establishment of a business
and becoming self-employed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States are free to establish their own disqualifications for failure to meet these requirements. States should note
that, like unavailability for work, failure to participate may be only a temporary condition which should not necessarily
result in an indefinite denial. Conversely, quitting the SEA program may be grounds for a duration disqualification.
The draft language provides for a disqualification only for the week the failure occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States also have the option of dropping an individual from the SEA program for failure to meet SEA requirements. This
may be appropriate if, for example, the individual misses training necessary to commence self-employment activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitation on receipt of self-employment assistance allowances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section implements section 3306(t)(4), FUTA, which limits the number of individuals receiving SEA allowances
at any given time to 5 percent of the number of individuals receiving regular UC. Giving the commissioner authority
to create regulations to meet this requirement provides flexibility to the agency to assure that necessary data will
be collected as required by this Department and that the five percent limit will not be exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Financing costs of SEA allowances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since State UC law may provide only for the financing of regular UC and not SEA allowances, it may be necessary to describe
the financing mechanism for the allowances. The draft language uses the same mechanism as is used for regular UC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Draft language for the noncharging of SEA allowances is not provided at this time as the Department is not addressing
the issue of whether such allowances may be noncharged at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Effective Date and Termination Date.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since SEA allowances may be paid only after enactment of State law and approval by this Department, it will be necessary
to specify that the allowances will not become payable until both conditions are met. The draft language assures that
SEA allowances will not become payable until the first week aster both conditions are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the authority under NAFTA for SEA programs terminates five years after the date of enactment of NAFTA, it is recommended
that States ``sunset'' any SEA provisions. The draft language provided does not provide a definite expiration date
since States may wish to continue operating a SEA program if the Federal authority is extended either on a temporary
or permanent basis. States may, however, wish to include a specific expiration date. The draft language takes into
account an expiration of Federal legislative authority which falls on a weekday by providing that the program will
terminate as of the end of the week preceding the week containing the ending date of the Federal authority. If, however,
the ending date of the Federal authority as a Saturday, then the State must end its SEA program on later than midnight
on such Saturday.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, ``Fire Protection Program for Nuclear Power Facilities Operating Prior To January 1,
1979,'' section III.G.2, to the Power Authority of the State of New York the (licensee) for the Indian Point Nuclear
Generating Unit No. 3 (IP3), located at the licensee's site in Westchester County, New York.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section III.G.2 of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, specifies measures to be taken to ensure that one train of redundant equipment
necessary to achieve and maintain hot shutdown conditions remains free of fire damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During a programmatic review of IP3's Fire Protection Program and Appendix R compliance strategy, the licensee identified
that safe shutdown instrument sensing lines inside containment do not meet the separation requirements of section
III.G.2 of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R. Specifically, in some areas the wide-range steam generator (SG) water level
and pressurizer level sensing lines are not separated by a horizontal distance of 20 feet, nor are they separated by
a radiant energy shield. In addition, fire detection and suppression in the area is limited. The licensee has, therefore,
requested exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, section III.G.2, for the wide-range SG water
level and pressurizer level sensing lines within the IP3 containment structure.

Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption is needed to permit the licensee to operate the plant without being in violation of the Commission's
regulations and to obviate the need for extensive modifications. Physical modification of the plant to achieve literal
compliance with 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, section III.G.2, would require many design changes, for example: rerouting
portions of the sensing lines, installing additional barriers, and the installation of additional fire suppression
and detection. Given the location of the sensing lines, the implementation of these changes would entail extensive
scaffolding, as well as engineering and financial resources. In addition, since these modifications were not anticipated
in the current outage scope, the detailed development and implementation of such design changes could significantly
delay restart from the current outage, resulting in lost revenue.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section III.G.2 of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, requires that where redundant trains of systems necessary to achieve
and maintain hot shutdown conditions are located within the same fire area inside containment, fire protection must
be provided by separation of cables and equipment by a horizontal distance of 20 feet, noncombustible radiant energy
shields, or by installation of fire detectors and an automatic fire suppression system in the fire area. The licensee
has determined that certain sections of the wide-range SG water level and pressurizer level sensing lines within
containment do not meet these requirements. Therefore, the licensee has requested an exemption from the requirement
of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, section III.G.2, for these sensing lines within the containment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The likely result of a fire affecting the sensing lines would be erroneous signals. The erroneous signals would not
initiate until the fluid inside the lines is heated by the fire and would terminate after the fire was extinguished.
The lines themselves would not experience fire damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The capability to safely shutdown the unit would not be jeopardized in the event that a fire results in erroneous wide-range
SG water level or pressurizer level indications. Specifically, a fire inside containment would not necessitate
control room evacuation (i.e., alternate shutdown), so operations personnel would have access to numerous and diverse
plant status indications. In addition, plant operating procedures advise personnel that a fire may cause anomalous
equipment behavior. Erroneous wide-range SG water level or pressurizer level indications resulting from a fire
would be of short duration due to low combustion loadings inside containment. The fixed combustible loading in containment
is very small and the locations of the redundant sensing lines are remote from fixed combustibles. The largest fixed
combustible load, reactor coolant pump oil, is contained in a collection system in accordance with 10 CFR part 50,
Appendix R, section III.O, and automatic smoke detectors are installed above each reactor coolant pump. Personnel
access to the containment is restricted during power operation. As such, the potential for transient combustible
materials to accumulate in the containment is very low. The containment is inspected by operations personnel prior
to plant startup.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the considerations discussed above, the Commission concludes that granting the proposed exemption will
not increase the probability of an accident and will not result in any post-accident radiological releases significantly
in excess of those previously determined for IP3. The proposed exemption would not otherwise affect radiological
plant effluents, nor result in any significant occupational exposure. In addition, the exemption does not affect
nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed exemption.

Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative to the proposed action, the Commission considered denial of the proposed action. Denial of the application
would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and
the alternative action are similar. The alternative would also result in unwarranted expenditures of engineering
and financial resources, and could significantly delay restart from the current outage.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of a one-time schedular exemption
from the requirements of sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 to the Tennessee Valley Authority,
licensee for the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN), Unit 2. The plant is located at the licensee's site in Hamilton County,
Tennessee. The exemption was requested by the licensee in its letter dated February 4, 1994.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The action would exempt the licensee from the provisions in sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of appendix J to 10 CFR
part 50 with respect to the requirement to perform Primary Containment Type B and Type C local leak rate tests at intervals
no greater than 2 years. The exemption would affect Unit 2 only and allow the tests to be delayed until the Cycle 6 refueling
outage. This outage is scheduled to start approximately 4 months after the 2-year period ends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between March and April 1992, all Type B and Type C local leak rate tests were preformed during the SQN Unit 2 Cycle 5 refueling
outage. Between March 1, 1993, and October 19, 1993, Unit 2 was shut down due to a steam leak in the secondary system,
and experienced several forced shutdowns since it was restarted. Due to the accumulated length of the shutdowns,
TVA has decided to delay start of the Unit 2 Cycle 6 refueling outage until July 1994. As a result, the expiration of the
2-year time interval for the Type B and Type C tests occurs before the outage starts. Therefore, to perform the tests
in accordance with the requirement would force the unit to shut down in April 1994. To prevent this, the proposed exemption
would allow a one-time deferment of the Appendix J interval requirement from March 1994 until the shutdown in July
1994. The result would be an interval of approximately 4 months since the previous test for any component.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This environmental assessment is similar to an environmental assessment processed by the Commission and forwarded
by letter dated November 9, 1993. It was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on November 16, 1993 (58 FR 60470). This action addressed the 10 CFR part 50 appendix J exemption for the Unit 2 refueling
outage when it was scheduled to begin in April 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is required to exempt the licensee from the requirement to conduct Type B and Type C containment
local leak rate tests on SQN Unit 2 at a 2-year frequency so that the tests can be performed during the Cycle 6 refueling
outage that is scheduled to start in July 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the requested action, exemption from the above requirement would allow the licensee to delay conducting
Type B and Type C local leak rate tests at Unit 2 approximately 4 months beyond the scheduled expiration date of the 2-year
period. This relatively small increase in the test interval does not significantly contribute to the total Type B
and Type C leakage limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of Sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of appendix J is to ensure that containment leakage is maintained within
the prescribed limits. Based on the following information, the exemption will not significantly affect the ability
of the individual primary containment components that are subject to Type B or Type C tests to perform this safety function:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The valves and components for which the extension of the 2-year interval is being requested have a history of being
leak tight and in good condition. The leak-tight condition of these components was last verified by Type B and C local
leak rate tests conducted during the Cycle 5 refueling outage in 1992 and, at least for many, by the Type A containment
leak rate test conducted on Unit 2 during the same refueling outage. Based on the present containment leakage that
accounts for the less than 8.0 percent of the 0.6 percent La limit, the remaining margin is sufficient to ensure any
incremental increase in leakage resulting from the extension would not cause unacceptable as-found test results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Based on historical data, any incremental increase in leakage because of the extension will be small. Improved
maintenance practices implemented during the Unit 2 Cycle 5 outage, including motor operated valve testing of containment
isolation valves, periodic replacement of valve packing, and periodic lubrication of valve stems, provide increased
assurance that these components will perform their safety function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Many of the components for which the exemption is requested were included in the Type A test performed in April 1992.
This test indicated a containment leak rate of 0.15 percent per day, which is below the 0.1875 percent per day limit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to other potential radiological environmental impacts, the proposed exemption does not increase the
radiological effluents from the facility and does not increase the occupational exposure at the facility. Therefore,
the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological impacts associated with the proposed exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological environmental impacts, the proposed exemption involves systems located
within the restricted areas as defined in 10 CFR part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has
no other significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed exemption does not significantly change the conclusions in the licensee's ``Final Environmental
Statement Related to the Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2'' (FES), dated February 21, 1974. The Commission
concluded that operation of the Sequoyah units will not result in any environmental impacts other than those evaluated
in the FES and its letter to the licensee dated September 15, 1981, which granted the facility operating license DPR&hyph;79
for Unit 2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the staff has concluded that there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption,
any alternative to this exemption will have either no significantly different environmental impact or greater environmental
impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce environmental impacts
as a result of plant operations.

Self-Regulatory Organizations: Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating
to Trade Recording and Price Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
March 8, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 22, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Interpretation and Policy .01 to CBOE rule 6.51, ``Reporting Duties,'' requires both the buyer and the
seller in a transaction to record on a card or ticket information concerning the transaction, including the buyer's
or seller's assigned broker initial code and his clearing firm (if a market maker), the symbol of the underlying security,
the type, expiration month and exercise price of the option contract, the transaction price, the number of contract
units comprising the transaction, the time of the transaction, the name of the contra clearing firm member and the
assigned broker initial code of the contra member. Under Interpretation and Policy .01, this information constitutes
the ``transaction record.'' The CBOE proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 to allow members to submit options
transaction data to the Exchange for trade recording and price reporting purposes in various media in addition to
paper form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposal is to enable CBOE members to submit options transaction data to the
CBOE for trade recording and price reporting purposes in various media in addition to paper form. Under current CBOE
rule 6.51, members are required to submit transaction data in paper form only, either on a trade ticket or on a transaction
card. The CBOE states that in today's market and operations technology environment the limitation is unduly restrictive,
and some Exchange members have requested the opportunity to submit transaction record data by means of electronic
data transmission. Submission in that form would enable those members to report trades and prices to the CBOE through
the same automated medium they use to report that information to their clearing firms. Accordingly, the CBOE seeks
authority to approve particular media in addition to paper that CBOE members may use for trade recording and price
reporting purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In administering the proposed rule change, the CBOE will from time to time identity particular media and formats acceptable
for use under Exchange Rule 6.51 based on members' needs and will inform members about acceptable media and formats
through appropriate circulars. The CBOE expects to identify as acceptable only those media that involve secure and
tested technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and with section
6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to facilitate cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
the clearance and settlement of securities transactions, consistent with the protection of investors and the public
interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

As discussed in detail in the initial order granting PTC's temporary registration,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 one of the primary reasons for PTC's registration was to develop depository facilities for mortgage-backed securities,
particularly securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (``GNMA''). PTC services
include certificate safekeeping, book entry deliveries, an automated facility for the pledge or segregation of
securities, and other services related to the immobilization of securities certificates.

PTC continued its efforts over the past year to implement operational and procedural changes in connection with PTC's
temporary registration.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 For example, PTC acquired rights to the SPEED source code, thereby facilitating the process of enhancing the SPEED
system to suit PTC's needs. PTC also initiated a program to distribute to participants a portion of GNMA I principal
and interest (``P&amp;I'') earlier in the day,
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 and in December 1993, introduced a new P&amp;I processing system, PRISM, that further automates P&amp;I data processing.
PTC was able to reduce its fees to participants further, effective January 1, 1994,
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 and declared a dividend of $.525 per share to stockholders of record on December 31, 1993.

In connection with PTC's original temporary registration, PTC committed to the Commission and the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York to make a number of operational and procedural changes, which include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Eliminating trade reversals from PTC's procedures to cover a participant default;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Phasing out the aggregate excess net debit limitation for extensions under the net debit monitoring level procedures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Making principal and interest advances, now mandatory, optional;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Allowing participants to retrieve securities in the abeyance account and not allowing participants to reverse
a transfer because its customer may not be able to fulfill its financial obligations to the participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Eliminating the deliverer's security interest and replacing it with a substitute;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Reexamining PTC's account structure rules to make them consistent with PTC's lien procedures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Expanding and diversifying PTC's lines of credit;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Although PTC has made considerable progress toward complying with the undertakings set out above, PTC needs more
time to implement fully the changes necessary for compliance. Accordingly, PTC has requested that the Commission
extend PTC's registration as a clearing agency until March 31, 1995, to permit PTC to gain experience and stability
as a fully operative depository and to comply fully with the undertakings made in connection with PTC's registration.

First, ICC intends to require that letters of credit state expressly that payment must be made prior to the close of
business on the third banking day following demand. Second, ICC proposes to amend its rules to eliminate the issuer's
right to revoke the letter of credit. Third, unless otherwise permitted by ICC, ICC's proposal requires letters of
credit to expire on a quarterly basis rather than annually. Fourth, ICC proposes to add language to its rules to make
explicit ICC's authority to draw upon a letter of credit at any time, whether or not the clearing member that deposited
the letter of credit has been suspended or is in default, if ICC determines that such a draw is advisable to protect ICC,
other clearing members, or the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, ICC proposes to amend its rules to grant its chairman limited discretion to accept a letter of credit that
varies from the standards set forth in its rules. This discretionary power will be limited by the following factors:
(1) Before using this power, the chairman must consult with the staffs of ICC's regulatory agencies, which include
the Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''); (2) this power can be used only in unusual
circumstances and only on a temporary basis; (3) after exercising such power, the chairman must advise ICC's board
of directors; and (4) ICC must promptly notify clearing members affected by the exercise of this power.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 ICC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of section 17A of Act.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, ICC believes the proposed rule change promotes the protection of investors by enhancing ICC's ability
to safeguard the securities and funds in its possession or subject to its control.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons set forth in the previous Commission order approving ICC's revised standards for letters of credit
deposited as margin, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with ICC's obligations under section
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Among other things, the revised standards: (1) Should make the letters of credit ICC will accept as margin deposits
more liquid than under the previous standards and, consequently, should permit ICC to more safely rely upon such letters
of credit; (2) should result in more frequent assessments of the financial conditions of clearing members depositing
letters of credit and thereby should facilitate the discovery of any adverse developments in a more timely manner:
and (3) should make letters of credit a more reliable form of margin deposit than previously because issuers will no
longer be able to revoke letters of credit at times when clearing members most need credit facilities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, when a clearing member is experiencing financial difficulties or during times of market volatility).
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 By approving the proposed rule change on a temporary basis through December 31, 1994, ICC, the Commission, and other
interested parties will be able to assess further any effects these revised standards have on letter of credit issuance
and on margin deposited at ICC.

agency be designed to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or control of the clearing
agency or for which the clearing agency is responsible.

The Commission and ICC currently are studying concentration limits on letters of credit deposited as margin. The
Division believes that clearing agencies that accept letters of credit as margin deposits or clearing fund contributions
should limit their exposure by imposing concentration limits on the use of letters of credit. Generally, clearing
agencies impose limitations on the percentage of an individual member's required deposit or contribution that may
be satisfied with letters of credit, limitations on the percentage of the total required deposits or contributions
that may be satisfied with letters of credit by any one issuer, or some combination of both. ICC has no concentration
limits on the use of letters of credit issued by U.S. institutions.

ICC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving because
the Commission believes it is desirable that the revised standards that were implemented under the previous temporary
approval order remain in place pending permanent approval.

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 25, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one
establishing or changing a fee under section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the
Commission's receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.

The NASD is proposing to add new section 45 to the Code of Arbitration Procedure to require that any member named as a
party to an arbitration proceeding shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department
perfects service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. Below is the text of the proposed rule
change. Proposed new language is italicized.

Sec. 45. (a) Each member who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, whether in a Claim, Counterclaim, Crossclaim
or Third-Party claim, shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department perfects
service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. For each associated person who is named, the surcharge
shall be assessed against the member or members which employed the associated person at the time of the events which
gave rise to the dispute, claim or controversy. No member shall be assessed more than a single surcharge in any arbitration
proceeding. The surcharge shall not be subject to reimbursement under Subsection 43(c) of the Code.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The NASD is proposing to add new section 45 to the Code of Arbitration Procedure to provide that any member named as a
party to an arbitration proceeding shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department
perfects service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. In addition, any firm whose associated
persons are named in an arbitration proceeding will be assessed the surcharge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, the revenue-to-expense ratio of the NASD's arbitration service has resulted in a deficit, which has
been subsidized by other revenues of the Association. Although the deficit has declined in 1992, the NASD has determined
in a recent review of the arbitration process that the deficit will begin to rise in the immediate future as a result
of significantly increased resourcing needs. The NASD anticipates such needs to be ongoing. The increased resourcing
needs result from a number of factors, including case growth, more selective arbitrator recruitment, increased
arbitrator training, increased arbitrator compensation, and the anticipated overhaul of the arbitration administrative
systems. The NASD determined that the time frame within which to initiate cost recovery for impending resourcing
needs should be the immediate future, and that cost recovery should be directed at those member firms using the NASD's
arbitration service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new subsection (a) would require each member who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, whether
in a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim or third-party claim, to be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the
Arbitration Department perfects service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. This fee would
be in addition to fees assessed pursuant to section 43
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and 44
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 of the Code. The fee applies both to members who file as Claimants and to members who are served by the Arbitration Department
as Respondents. Therefore, in claims brought by members, the $200 fee would be assessed in addition to the $500 claim
filing fee described in the current fee schedule. For an associated person who is named as a party to an arbitration
proceeding, the fee would be assessed against the member firm or firms which employed the associated person at the
time of the events which gave rise to the claim. However, no member will be assessed more than a single charge in any arbitration
proceeding. Finally, subsection (a) clarifies that the surcharge is not subject to reimbursement under subsection
43(c) of the Code.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD estimates that it will collect the $200 surcharge on 75 percent of the approximately 5700 arbitration cases
expected to be filed in 1994, which will result in over $800,000 of additional revenue for the Arbitration Department
in 1994. Thus, the surcharge will effectively offset expenses to be incurred on arbitrator education through 1994.
The NASD expects the arbitrator education program to reach over 3,000 new arbitrators and almost 500 chairpersons
during the period that began in the fourth quarter of 1993 and will end at the end of 1994. This will add over $750,000
to the Arbitration Department expenses, which will include costs for staff and travel time, conference rooms, written
materials, videotape production and mailing costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(5)
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 of the Act, which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues,
fees and other charges among members in that the proposed rule equitably assesses a surcharge on each member that is
named or whose associated person is named and for which service is perfected in an arbitration proceeding and applies
such revenue to additional costs resulting from increased arbitration resourcing needs.

In FR Document No. 94&hyph;3250, beginning on page 6661, column 1, for Friday, February 11, 1994, a sentence was incorrectly
stated. The first paragraph should be changed to clarify that the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
did not participate in the submission of the revised Options Disclosure Document (``ODD'') and to indicate that the
Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed the revised ODD on behalf of, rather than in conjunction with, the American
Stock Exchange, Inc., the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the Pacific Stock
Exchange, Inc., and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Century Life, a mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of Iowa, entered into a permanent affiliation
with CUNA Mutual Life Insurance Society (``CUNA Mutual'') on July 1, 1990. Applicants state that the terms of the ``Agreement
of Permanent Affiliation'' provide for the following: Financial sharing between Century Life and CUNA Mutual of
future individual life insurance business through reinsurance arrangements; joint development of business plans
and systems for the distribution of individual insurance and other financial service products within the credit
union movement; and, sharing of certain resources and facilities. All of the directors of Century Life are also directors
of CUNA Mutual and many of the senior executive officers of Century Life hold similar positions with CUNA Mutual. Applicants
state that the affiliation is not a merger or a consolidation and that both Century Life and CUNA Mutual remain separately
owned by their respective contract owners who retain voting rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Account, established by Century Life on December 14, 1993 as a separate investment account under Iowa law, serves
as a funding medium for certain flexible premium individual deferred variable annuity contracts (the ``Contracts'').
Applicants state that the Account meets the definition of a ``separate account'' under the federal securities laws.
The Account is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. The application incorporates
by reference the registration statement, currently on file with the Commission (File No. 33&hyph;73738), for the
Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Account currently has five subaccounts, each of which invests exclusively in the shares of a designated investment
portfolio of the Ultra Series Fund (the ``Fund''). The Fund, a Massachusetts business trust, is registered under
the 1940 Act as an open-end diversified management investment company. The Fund currently has six investment portfolios,
five of which offer their shares to the Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Contracts may be purchased on a nontax qualified basis (the ``Nonqualified Contracts'') or they may be purchased
in connection with retirement plans, including retirement programs described in sections 401(a) or 403(b) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), or as individual retirement annuities that qualify for
favorable federal income tax treatment under section 409 of the Code (together, the ``Qualified Contracts'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. CUNA Brokerage Services, Inc. (``CUNA Brokerage'') acts as the principal underwriter, as defined in the 1940 Act,
of the Contracts pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement between Century Life and CUNA Brokerage. The principal
business address of CUNA Brokerage is the same as that of CUNA Mutual.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. An owner of a Contract may allocate purchase payments to one or more subaccounts of the Account, and the purchase
payments will be credited with the investment experience of the chosen subaccount or subaccounts. An owner of a Contract
may also allocate purchase payments to the guaranteed interest option, part of the general account of Century Life,
and such payments will be credited with interest as provided for in the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The minimum initial purchase payment for Nonqualified Contracts is $5,000 and for Qualified Contracts, other
than those sold in connection with tax sheltered annuity arrangements (``TSAs''), the amount is $2,000. Subsequent
purchase payments must be at least $1,000 and may be made any time before the annuity date and during the annuitant's
lifetime. Initial and subsequent purchase payments for TSAs must be at least $25, and such payments in each Contract
year must total $300 and be paid pursuant to a schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Contract provides for a series of annuity payments beginning on the annuity date. The Contract owner may select
from four annuity payment options, two of which are available only as a fixed annuity and two of which are available
as either a variable or a fixed annuity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If the owner of a Contract dies prior to the annuity date and the Contract is in force, Century Life will, upon receipt
of due proof of death, pay a death benefit. If the annuitant is age 75 or younger, the death benefit is equal to the greatest
of:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Aggregate purchase payments made under the Contract less partial withdrawals as of the date that Century Life
receives due proof of death; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Contract value as of the date that Century Life receives due proof of death; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The death benefit floor amount as of the date of death plus any net purchase payments and minus any partial withdrawals
made since the most recent death benefit floor computation anniversary;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
less premium taxes not previously deducted and any outstanding loan amount on the date the death benefit is paid. The
death benefit floor amount is the Contract value on the most recent death benefit floor computation anniversary.
Death benefit floor computation anniversaries occur on the seventh Contract anniversary and each seventh Contract
anniversary thereafter prior to the annuitant's 76th birthday. After the annuitant's 76th birthday, the death benefit
will equal the Contract value less any outstanding loan amount and any applicable premium taxes not previously deducted
as of the date that Century Life receives due proof of the annuitant's death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. On each Contract anniversary prior to the annuity date, Century Life deducts from the variable Contract value
an annual fee of $30. Applicants guarantee that this charge will not increase and state that the charge reimburses
Century Life for administrative expenses relating to the Contract. The fee will be deducted from each subaccount
based on the proportion that the value in each such subaccount bears to the total Contract value. After the annuity
date, the annual Contract fee is deducted from variable annuity payments. Applicants represent that this charge
will be deducted in reliance upon Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act and that the charge represents reimbursement only for
administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contract. Applicants further represent that Century
Life does not anticipate a profit from this charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Century Life deducts a daily administrative charge equal to an annual effective rate of .15% of the assets of the
Account. The application states that this charge will compensate Century Life for certain expenses incurred in administering
the Contracts. Applicants represent that this charge will be deducted in reliance upon Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act
and that the charge represents reimbursement only for administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life
of the Contract. Applicants further represent that Century Life does not expect to make a profit from this charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Although no fee is currently charged for transfers, Century Life reserves the right to charge $10 for the 13th and
each subsequent transfer during a Contract year. The transfer fee will be deducted from the subaccount or guarantee
amount from which the transfer is made. Applicants represent that where the fee is imposed, Applicants will rely upon
Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act for the deduction. Applicants state that the transfer fee will represent reimbursement
only for administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contract. Applicants further represent
that Century Life does not anticipate a profit from this charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Applicants note that various governmental entities levy a premium tax, currently ranging up to 3.5%, on annuity
contracts, such as the Contracts, issued by insurance companies. The timing of the tax levies varies among taxing
authorities. The application states that if applicable to a Contract, premium taxes will be deducted either: (a)
From purchase payments as received; (b) from Contract value upon withdrawal or surrender; (c) from adjusted Contract
value upon application to an annuity payment option; or (d) upon payment of a death benefit. Applicants note that Century
Life reserves the right to deduct premium taxes at the time such taxes are incurred.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. A contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'') of up to 7% is imposed on the partial withdrawal or surrender
of purchase payments within seven years of such payments having been made. The Sales Charge is deducted from the Contract
value remaining after withdrawal so that the reduction in Contract value as a result of a withdrawal will be greater
than the withdrawal amount requested. Amounts obtained from imposition of the Sales Charge will be used to cover expenses
relating to the sale of the Contracts, including payment of commissions to registered representatives and other
promotional expenses. Applicants state that Century Life does not anticipate that the Sales Charge will generate
sufficient revenues to pay the cost of distributing the Contracts. If the Sales Charge is insufficient to cover the
cost of distribution, the deficiency will be met from the general account assets of Century Life and these assets may
include amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expense risks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Century Life will impose a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets of
the Account to compensate Century Life for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts.
Approximately .85% of the 1.25% charge is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately .40% is attributable
to expense risk. Century Life guarantees that this charge will never exceed 1.25%. If the mortality and expense risk
charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks under the Contracts, Century Life will bear the loss.
Conversely, if the charge exceeds costs, the excess will be profit to Century Life. Applicants state that Century
Life currently anticipates a profit from this charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Applicants state that the mortality risk borne by Century Life arises from its contractual obligation to make
annuity payments (as determined in accordance with the Contracts) regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual
annuitant may live. Applicants state that this undertaking assures that neither annuitant's own longevity nor an
improvement in general life expectancy will adversely affect the periodic annuity payments that a payee will receive
under the Contract. Applicants state that Century Life also incurs a risk in connection with the death benefit guarantee
and that there is no charge for this guarantee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Applicants state that the expense risk assumed by Century Life is the risk that administration costs will exceed
amounts received by Century Life through imposition of the administration charge, the transfer fee (where imposed)
and the annual Contract fee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant exemptions from sections
26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the daily charge for mortality
and expense risks. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27 (c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit
investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates
unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian
and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not
exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative
services of a character normally performed by the bank itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants assert that the charge for mortality and expense risks is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed
by Century Life under the Contracts. Applicants state that the charge is a reasonable charge to compensate Century
Life for the risks that: the annuitants under the Contracts will live longer than has been anticipated in setting the
annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts; the Contract value will be less than the death benefit; and administrative
expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the asset-based administration charge, the transfer fee and the
Contract fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants represent that the charge of 1.25% for the mortality and expense risks assumed by Century Life is within
the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation
is based upon Century Life's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry practices, taking
into consideration such factors as: current charge levels; charge level guarantees; and guaranteed annuity rates.
Applicants represent that Century Life will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission,
a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, the
comparative survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants represent that Century Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution
financing arrangement will benefit the Account and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth
in a memorandum which will be maintained by Century Life and will be made available to the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Century Life also represents that the Account will invest only in management investment companies which undertake,
in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such
plan formulated and approved by the company's board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of
such company within the meaning of the 1940 Act.

Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections
26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

5. The Valiant Fund offers its series at net asset value without any sales charge. The Valiant Fund has adopted a rule
12b&hyph;1 plan, but no payments have been authorized or will be made during the current fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants seek relief to implement a proposed multiple pricing system (the ``Multiple Pricing System''). Under
applicants' proposal, the non-money market series of the Trusts will provide investors the option of purchasing
shares: (a) with a front-end sales load and in certain circumstances a distribution fee of up to .75% (``Class A shares'');
(b) subject to a CDSC and distribution and shareholder services fees of up to 1% (``Class B shares''); (c) subject to
a CDSC that will normally be lower than the CDSC imposed on Class B shares and a distribution and shareholder services
fees of up to 1% (``Class C shares''); and (d) without a sales charge and either with or without distribution and shareholder
services fees of up to .75% (``Class D shares''). Each of the money market series of the Trusts will provide investors
the option of purchasing shares: (a) without a sales load and subject to a distribution fee of up to .35% (``Class E shares'');
(b) without a sales load and subject to distribution and shareholder services fees of up to .75% (``Class F shares'');
and (c) without sales charges or distribution fees (``Class G''). Each series' rule 12b&hyph;1 plan will be amended
as necessary to accommodate the proposed fee arrangements of each class.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Existing shares of The One Group correspond to shares authorized under the Multiple Pricing System as follows:
Class A shares of the non-money market series correspond to Class A shares, and class A shares of the money market series
correspond to Class E shares; class B shares correspond to Class B shares; retirement class shares of the non-money
market series correspond to Class D shares, and retirement class shares of the money market series correspond to Class
F shares; fiduciary class shares of the non-money market series correspond to Class D shares, and fiduciary class
shares of the money market series correspond to Class G shares. Existing shares of The Kent Fund correspond to shares
authorized under the Multiple Pricing System as follows: investment class shares of the non-money market series
correspond to Class A shares, and investment class shares of the money market series correspond to Class E shares;
institutional class shares of the non-money market series correspond to Class D shares, and institutional class
shares of the money market series correspond to Class F shares. Shares of Allmerica Funds' existing non-money market
series will be redesignated Class A, and shares of the existing money market series will be redesignated Class E.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. From time to time each Trust also may offer additional classes of shares. Certain of these additional classes (``Indirect
Investor Classes'') will be offered only to Qualified Institutional Investors (as defined herein). All classes
of shares other than the Indirect Investor Classes, including Classes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, will be referred to herein
as ``Direct Investor Classes.'' Qualified Institutional Investors eligible to purchase Indirect Investor Classes
are limited to the following five categories: (a) benefit plans such as qualified retirement plans, other than individual
retirement accounts and retirement plans of self-employed persons, with total assets in excess of $5 million or such
other amounts as the Trusts may establish and with such other characteristics as the Trusts may establish; (b) defined
contribution retirement plans maintained by the Advisers or their affiliates for the benefit of their employees;
(c) banks and insurance companies purchasing shares for their own accounts; (d) registered investment companies
not affiliated with 440 Financial or with any of the Advisers; and (e) endowment funds of non-profit organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The benefit plans in category (a) will have a separate trustee for the plan who is vested with investment discretion
as to plan assets. The plan beneficiaries will have limited ability to access their plan investments without incurring
adverse tax consequences. Applicants will exclude self-directed plans from this category. The assets of the tax-exempt
retirement plans in category (b) will be held in trust by a trustee, and the employees who participate in such plans
will have limited pre-retirement access to their plan investments. The investors in categories (c), (d), and (e)
will share with category (a) the essential features of substantial assets under management and investment decision-making
by institutional management. Investors in the Direct Investor Classes will not be eligible to purchase shares of
the Indirect Investor Classes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applicants propose to convert Class B shares, other than Class B shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions, automatically to Class A shares a certain number of years after the end of the calendar month in
which the shareholders' order to purchase was accepted. Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions will be considered held in a separate sub-account, and each time any Class B shares convert to Class
A shares, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
portion of the Class B shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends or distributions also will convert.
The purpose of the conversion feature is to relieve the holders of the Class B shares from continuing to pay a high ongoing
distribution fee after the Class B shares have been outstanding long enough for the Distributor to have recouped its
distribution expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Shares of one class of a series generally may be exchanged for a corresponding class of another series belonging
to the same ``family of funds'' (as defined in rule 11a&hyph;3). Each Trust is a separate family of funds. Exchanges
will not be permitted between Direct Investor Classes of shares and Indirect Investor Classes of shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Applicants seek exemptive relief to permit them to impose a CDSC on redemptions of shares of Classes B and C. In no
event would the aggregate amount of the Class B CDSC exceed 6% of the aggregate purchase payments made by an investor
for Class B shares of a series. The CDSC for the Class C shares of a series will not exceed 1% of the aggregate purchase
payments. The CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net
asset value of the shares at the time of purchase or redemption. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC,
it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares representing capital appreciation, next of shares representing
reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions, and finally of other shares held by the shareholder for
the longest period of time.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. The Trusts intend to waive the CDSC in the event of one or more of the following occurrences: (a) on redemptions following
the death or disability, as defined in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code or 1986, as amended (the ``Code''),
of a shareholder if redemption is made within one year of death or disability of a shareholder, as relevant; (b) in connection
with a lump-sum or other distribution following retirement or, in the case of an IRA or Keough Plan or a custodial account
pursuant to section 403(b)(7) of the Code, after attaining age 591/2 or, in connection with redemptions which result
from a tax-free return of an excess contribution pursuant to section 408(d) (4) or (5) of the Code or from the death or
disability of the employee; (c) in connection with redemptions of shares purchased by officers, directors or trustees,
and employees of the series, the Advisers and their affiliated entities the Distributors and their affiliated entities,
and by the members of the immediate families of such persons; (d) in connection with redemptions of shares made pursuant
to a shareholder's participation in any systematic withdrawal plan adopted by a series; (e) in connection with redemptions
effected by advisory accounts managed by the Advisers and their affiliated entities; (f) in connection with redemptions
by tax-exempt employee benefit plans as a result of the enactment or promulgation of any law or regulation pursuant
to which continuation of the investment in the series would be improper; and (g) in connection with redemptions effected
by a registered investment company in connection with the combination of the investment company with a series by merger,
acquisition of assets, or by any other transaction. In addition, the Trusts intend to reduce the CDSC in connection
with redemptions by large accountholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Each series may provide a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 credit for any CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of shares from a series followed by a reinvestment in the series
effected within 365 days, or a shorter period, of the redemption. The credit will be paid for by the series' distributor.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) to the extent
that the proposed issuance and sale of various classes of shares representing interests in the same Trust might be
deemed: (a) to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g); (b) prohibited by section 18(f)(1);
and (c) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement will better enable the Trusts to meet the competitive
demands of today's financial services industry. Under the multiclass arrangement, an investor will be able to choose
the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial given the amount of his or her purchase, the length of time the
investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances. The proposed arrangement would permit
the Trusts to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide investors with a broader choice as
to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment
risks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the rule 12b&hyph;1 plans in the manner described
is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. In addition, such arrangements should
not give rise to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges of each class of shares are substantially
identical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement does not present the concerns that section 18 was
designed to address. The multi-class arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares of the
Trusts. The multi-class arrangement does not involve borrowing, nor will it affect the Trust's existing assets or
reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure. Nothing in the multi-class arrangement suggests that
it will facilitate control by holders of any class of shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicants submit that the requested exemption to permit the Trusts to implement the proposed CDSCs is appropriate
in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors, and consistent with the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the Act. The proposed CDSC arrangements will provide shareholders the option of having
their full payment invested for them at the time of their purchase of shares of the Trusts with no deduction of an initial
sales charge.

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a series and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same series will
relate solely to: (a) the method of financing certain expenses that may be imposed upon a particular class of shares
and which are limited to (i) incremental transfer agent fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable
to a specific class of shares, (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials
such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class of shares, (iii)
blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares,
(v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class,
(vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares, (vii) trustees' fees incurred as a
result of issues relating to one class of shares, and (viii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified
that should be properly allocated to one class of shares which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order,
(collectively, ``Class Expenses''); (b) the impact of different rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (if any) or shareholder services
plan (if any) payments made by a particular class of shares; (c) voting rights on matters which pertain to rule 12b&hyph;1
plans or shareholder services plans; (d) the conversion feature applicable to classes of shares sold subject to a
CDSC which are convertible into a class of shares not subject to a CDSC; and (e) the designation of each class of shares
of a series. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If a series implements any amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by a class of shares under the plan into which another class will convert (the ``Target Class''), existing
shares of the class that will convert (``Purchase Class'') will stop converting into Target Class shares unless the
Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The trustees shall take such action
as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares
(``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed
advisable by the trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase
Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material
respects except that New Purchase Class shares will convert into New Target Class shares. New Target Class or New Purchase
Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall
be effected in any manner that the trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance
with condition 6 below, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class
or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Advisers and the Distributors. Purchase Class shares sold after
the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided
that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are
disclosed in an effective registration statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative
net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion,
the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined
in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based
sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The trustees of each of the Trusts, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall have approved the Multiple
Pricing System, prior to the implementation of the Multiple Pricing System by a particular series. The minutes of
the meetings of the trustees regarding their deliberations with respect to the approvals necessary to implement
the Multiple Pricing System will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the Multiple Pricing System is
in the best interest of both the series and their respective shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a series
and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the trustees, including a majority of
the independent trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable
by a series to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the trustees, and the trustees shall review, at least quarterly,
a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which such expenditures were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. On an ongoing basis, the trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will
monitor each series for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares.
The trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Advisers and the Distributors will be responsible for reporting
any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a conflict arises, the Advisers and the Distributors at their
own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing
expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the
statements, only distribution expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a class of shares will
be used to support any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan or shareholder services plan expenditures charged to such class. Expenditures
not related to the sale or servicing of a specific class will not be presented to the trustees to support rule 12b&hyph;1
plan or shareholder services plan expenditures charged to shareholders of such class of shares. The statements,
including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent
trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. If any class will be subject to a shareholder services plan, such shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated
in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder
were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders will not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Dividends paid by a series with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that expenditures associated
with any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan or shareholder services plan and any Class Expense will be borne by the affected class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses among such classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'').
The Expert has rendered a report to the applicants (and such report has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the application),
stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will
be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor
the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and based upon such review, will render at least
annually a report to the Trusts that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert
shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act.
The work papers of the Experts with respect to such reports, following request by the Trusts (which the Trusts agree
to make), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request for such work papers by a senior
member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate
Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, any Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrator
or Associate and Assistant Administrator. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures
placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and
tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time
to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation
of income and expenses among such classes of shares and this representation will be concurred with by the Expert in
the initial report referred to in condition 10 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute
Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 10 above. The applicants
agree to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the
ongoing reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The prospectuses of the series relating to each class of shares will contain a statement to the effect that financial
institutions, groups, and any other person entitled to receive any compensation for selling series shares may receive
different levels of compensation for selling one particular class of shares over another in a series.

denatured alcohol (SDA) or taxfree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TF) alcohol where the offer in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compromise does not exceed $10,000 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tax liability sought to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compromised is based upon either (a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of SDA or TF alcohol for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unauthorized purposes or (b) activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to which no liability would normally

Offers Encompassing Violations in Multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (a) The regional director (compliance) in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose region the permittee or brewer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for the majority of violations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is located will be the deciding official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for offers involving violations or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permittees in more than one region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, cases that include a previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued order to show cause will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolved by the regional director who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized issuance of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Tax cases regarding members of controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will generally be resolved by the regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
director (compliance) in whose region the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members are located. However, if multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities for the same tax period(s) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have occurred as a result of preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of late filed tax returns or late paid tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handled by a central location, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties will be resolved by the regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
director (compliance) in whose region lies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the central location.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 4672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an importer or exporter of any substance may request that the Secretary
determine whether such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such substance
to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals constitute
more than 50 percent of the weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce such substance.
This determination is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1
C.B. 717, sets forth the rules relating to the determination process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 5, 1990, the Secretary determined that bisphenol-A and alpha-methylstyrene should be added to the list of
taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, effective July 1, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of tax prescribed for bisphenol-A, under section 4671(b)(3), is $5.11 per ton. This is based upon a conversion
factor for benzene of 0.68 and a conversion factor for propylene of 0.37. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of tax prescribed for alpha-methylstyrene, under section 4671(b)(3), is $4.96 per ton. This is based upon
a conversion factor for benzene of 0.66 and a conversion factor for propylene of 0.36. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner is Aristech Chemical Corporation, a manufacturer and exporter of these substances. No material comments
were received on these petitions. The following information is the basis for the determinations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 4672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an importer or exporter of any substance may request that the Secretary
determine whether such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such substance
to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals constitute
more than 50 percent of the weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce such substance.
This determination is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1
C.B. 717, sets forth the rules relating to the determination process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 9, 1991, the Secretary determined that decabromodiphenyl oxide and tetrabromobisphenol-A should be added
to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, effective July 1, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of tax prescribed for decabromodiphenyl oxide, under section 4671(b)(3), is $7.41 per ton. This is based
upon a conversion factor for bromine of 1.666. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of tax prescribed for tetrabromobisphenol-A, under section 4671(b)(3), is $5.22 per ton. This is based upon
a conversion factor for bromine of 1.175. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals ethylene, methane, benzene, and nitric acid. Di-n-hexyl adipate
is a liquid produced predominantly by reaction of n-hexyl alcohol with adipic acid in the presence of a catalyst. n-hexyl
alcohol is produced from aluminum, natural gas (via hydrogen), and ethylene (via triethylaluminum). Oxidation
of the intermediate mixed trialkylaluminum with air produces a mixed aluminum alkoxide, which is hydrolyzed to produce
a mixture of alcohols, from which n-hexyl alcohol is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovered by distillation. Adipic acid is produced from benzene (via cyclohexane) and the methane in natural gas
(via hydrogen). Oxidation of cyclohexane using air and nitric acid in a two-step process produces adipic acid.

This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chlorine, benzene, sodium hydroxide, nitric acid, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfuric acid. Para-nitrophenol is a solid produced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predominantly by the reaction of para-nitrochlorobenzene with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aqueous sodium hydroxide, followed by reaction with sulfuric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acid to form para-nitrophenol from the resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
para-nitrophenoxide.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 4672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer or exporter of any substance may request that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary determine whether such substance should be listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance to the list of taxable substances in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute more than 50 percent of the weight, or more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such substance. This determination is to be made on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89&hyph;61, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989&hyph;1 C.B. 717, sets forth the rules relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination process.

Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 5, 1990, the Secretary determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perchloroethylene should be added to the list of taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Code, effective July 1, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of tax prescribed for perchloroethylene under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4671(b)(3), is $5.44 per ton. This is based upon a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion factor for ethylene of 0.17 and a conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor for chlorine of 1.71. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner is Vulcan Chemicals, a manufacturer and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exporter of this substance. No material comments were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received on this petition. The following information is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis for the determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Perchloroethylene is derived from the taxable chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethylene and chlorine. Perchloroethylene is a liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced predominantly by the high temperature chlorination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ethylene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The stoichiometric material consumption formula for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perchloroethylene is:

Perchloroethylene has been determined to be a taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance because a review of its stoichiometric material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent by weight of the materials used in its production.
